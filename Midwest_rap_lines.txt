As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Wonderinâ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 1oo things to do before I die

[Big Sean]
Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie thatâs all
Iâve been stressinâ so hard Iâm surprised I ain't going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into yaâll, hatinâ
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I ain't talkinâ bout computer love
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to God hoping that you got a Christ tag
Make it where Iâm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, say nay my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

[Hook]
As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 1oo things to do before I die
Wonderinâ if I could live it all in one life
Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 1oo things to do before I die

If I just stop breathinâ, even though I got all this muthafuckinâ money
Wont keep my heart beatinâ
Just donât let me die
Wake me up
You canât catch me dreaminâ
Bout all of this muthafuckinâ money
Cocaine rush, Iâm speedinâ
Cocaine rushâ¦

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Iâm just a Detroit nigga, nothing extra about me
I go extra hard at the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection at the same time
Iâm accepting the fact that thereâll never be nothing perfect about me
Shit, Iâm just waiting on a win
Come up with better hooks, the hoesâll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred, thats why you see our sick style yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chick is yonking, imagine this yapping at me
5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now Iâm Cali swagginâ
My nigga listen, Iâm over the fame
You number 1, Iâm 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollinâ with lames, we aint rollinâ the same
Iâm the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets
If you ain't living your life for ya kids, I ain't giving yo ass no respect
(Sean, I love you my nigga, Iâm out)

[Hook]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I gotta break ya fuckinâ heart
I gotta climb these fuckinâ charts (I gotta climb)
I gotta do something thatâs innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with Tia and Tiaâs momma
Breakfast in bed with plenty of Carne Asada (I gotta)
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make âem turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall, but thats not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this Earth, the devil controls it
So before you scrutinise how I feel ask God if those polls important
The end is near!

[Hook]


[Hook]
Wishing I could rap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately Iâve been dreaming âbout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls, and enough money I could rule the world

(If I ruled the world)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
Iâm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
Iâm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hard top
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up, Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise
So my dog can quit wearing a 44 up on his waist like itâs his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping Ready or Not
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasnât ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in piece while he alive

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Seems lifeâs never at a stand still, even in a photo
Thinking about an the ex girl, I hold though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why donât school teach more mathematics
Less trigonometry and more about taxes
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life, instead of lab rat us
With a mansion thatâs about 5 floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got 5 more
With the fam that reminded me what Iâm alive for
And at the same time remind me what Iâd die for
A world where you wouldnât need sleep
That way weâd catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speed boat my dad always wanted
I swear I feel it coming

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream, well thatâs how it feels
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if itâs real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats Iâm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet the young Dennis, the menace of society
Check my sobriety fuck hoes in varities
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, Iâm getting doe man these flows âgon retire me
Splurging all crazy, switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy
Style on the dial, Iâve been serving yaâll lately
Cheddar on Federer
Ball âtill I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Sean]
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook:]
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
Ow -ow -ow [x8]

[Verse 2: Wi]
While I'm flying over Italy, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

[Verse 3: Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue
I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook:]
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
Ow -ow -ow [x8]


[Intro:]

She up and down the pole, like she, like she fire fighting
Bitch I'm finally famous, I do, I do what I wanna

Swear I got her head banging, banging, might be in a coma
Walk up to the baddest bitch and tell her that I own her

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
T killer, big game, gorilla

Oh really, milli vanili, fucking with me
Bet she lift that ass up high like she hit a wheelie
In the club, be in the back like
Niggas pretending to be me, and that shit don't offend me

Money committed, swear this shit be married
I get that cake, cake, cake, then I pop a cherry

[Hook]

Big blunts of that kush ducked off in that phantom

Bunch of hoes in my mattress getting trippy off them bars

'Bout to start a bank all this money that I made, cash
Sour D, the smoking biff niggas getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches begging Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up smoking 'til I'm stuffed

The room is moving side to side I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the phantom ain't no stopping the ride

Swear to God I feel incredible
Swear that my textin is no longer legible

Tell 'em to leave and come bring me back revenue
Getting paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vegetable I'm so professional

[Intro:]
The best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
I got the best drinks, good tree, and bad bitches
And that's what you gon' get anytime you fuckin' with us
Finally Famous, what's up?

[Verse 1:]
I'm on the west side of my city
Ridin' round like a tour guide
With that white girl she got a tongue ring
That might as well be a bullseye
She half naked walking 'round this bitch
I almost thought I was poolside
Tryna raw dog my... (oh!)
Like her tubes tied but that's suicide!
One time for my niggas who made something out of nothing -
Cause you could lose it all my nigga look at they've been roughin'
"You could lose it twice as fast as you got it"
Got it - that's what my grandma told me
And you've got to be a dumb dumb dumb motherfucker not to listen to what you hear from the OG's
Rollin' OG
'Til I G-O
Yeah G-O, nigga, add an O-D
That's what I rep, nigga, 'til I O-D
Collecting everything that this world owes me
I told my Momma grab you any kind of car
Girl cause you my shining star, I love you everywhere you are
Back to it - to the game I am committed
My intentions: stay persistent
Workin' overtime like we get paid off commissions
And my wrist bliss, work
Ms. Gliss, man I ain't got time like my wrist slit
No bitch fit, just a fit bitch
Who only drive bitch to make me feel terrific

[Hook:]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on

[Verse 2:]
I'm on the east side of my city
Ridin' round like it's "Doomsday"
And if you keep pushing my buttons
Might fuck around and be a "Tomb Day"
Don't let go of her hand -
Or it might be "Big-Sean-In-Her-Womb Day"
"Congratulations, dog! "
Man, that's what the whole room say
I want money and security for all of my descendants
We up in Hollywood, tryna get our hands some "in it"
If you don't fuck with my songs, man, you gotta fuck with the intention
Tryna get my fam and friends-es
Behind Benz-es, and cartier lenses - woah
I believe I can fly
I believe I'm the man
I believe in God
Man, they sending shots, shots, shots, shots
Like they don't believe I can die
Man, fuck whoever used to tell me to stop
A legend in the making -
Fuck whoever told me I'm not

[Hook:]
Now we going strong, we'll be going going gone, 'til we on


My, my, my, as the world turns
Today if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn
If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I fulfill every yearn, ah
Reminiscing on the rappers I would look up to
The ones who want my feature price and the hookup too
The girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too
Niggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to
Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be voting
So when you step inside my office, treat that beast like it's the Oval
El presidente, lord, sensei
Do ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting riskay
Crazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yea
Well this the life that I live
Collecting everything overdue, for all the work that I overdid
D-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah kid
Tryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist
'Cause when you come from the bottom man it's so hard to just get a glimpse
So hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic
And show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living
Like changing it then looking back and saying that we did it
Okay, como me llamo
She say Ingles, no hablo, man unless it's eat me out though
Benihani, my McDonald, all black leather jackets
While I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu
Wishing Lamborghinis made a five do'
'Cause I got too many real mufuckas I ride for, die for, uh
Straight out the metropolitan
My city need a hero so I treat it like Metropolis
And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't say
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man we ain't make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man we was trying to get away, man we was trying to get our day
And damn (damn), tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain't what it seem no mo' (no mo')
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suing me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settling, life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement like damn!

Shit, can't a young nigga live man
We done worked too hard
Yup, GOOD, Finally Famous nigga
We ain't never going broke nigga!


Cool cool cool cool
Yup, finally famous nigga

[Hook:]
Ok, I get lost in the night
Faded off of that brown
We can take shots of that white
Realest niggas around
Tell me would you like it would you like it if I let you call me big
Take it to the D, I can show you where I live
Take it to the penthouse and show you how to live
And treat it like it ain't shit

Now ask me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Yea tell me how it feel, how it feel, how it feel
Man to be around a nigga this real
You know I came up, came down
Turn every dream I had real
So tell me how it feel
How it feel, how it feel
Man to be around a nigga this real

[Verse 1:]
You know I need everything in plural
That's benji's and euro's
I just came back from that Paris
My life is moving in turbo
My pinky ring just dingling
Look how I'm sipping my merlot
Look how I'm hittin' my herbal
Praise God, church ho
What the fuck is you saying?
B.I.G I'm the mayor in the bitch
Ol' fur coat looking like a bear in this bitch
OH! fuck is you wearing? that's embarrassin shit
Man and to my new girls that's hearing this shit
You fucking with an OG, you should cherish this shit
Man they tell me that they love me, I ain't hearing that shit
They trynna get up in my will and inherit that shit
That's why I'm faded, I'm wasted
I'm living life like it's no jail
House bigger than a hotel
But these hoes tell
So I still take their ass to the hotel
In my hotel
I got a bad bitch with that body
And a badder bitch in that lobby
Boy that's just how I got it
When I...

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Bad bitches that came through
I'm hitting all that I aim to
So stoned I can't move
So stoned I can't move
She go either way like it's game two
She look at her phone praying it ain't you
Living out all the rumors
Then afterwards, say it ain't true
Man I'm daydreaming while sexing
Her screams remind me I'm in it
And all this champagne that I'm popping
Reminded me that I'm winning
I know we shouldn't get so high
Yea, remind me that when I'm finished
But this the life we chose
It's the only life that we know
Reminiscing when I had no job
Back when I woulda robbed yo job
Me and my niggas on the streets dog
Throwing signs up like we roadside
Now the suits and pasta both bowtie
My Greek girls say "opa"
My Spanish girls scream "no mas"
And all the Black girls scream "don't, stop"

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the jury is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cash back so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had 2 jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, I got her working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' yup!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'm a rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

[Hook 1:]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

[Verse 2: Wale]
Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my misses, fuck these other bitches
And this ain't biblical but this sermon is spiritual
'Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it's God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a seven Beemer
I'm trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having the gravity grievous
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That's like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I'm passionate with lyrics
And they ain't fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I'm handsome to these women, I'm envied by these no ones
That's no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don't drink everybody po' up
'Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon' show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing's getting closer
Even when I'm open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: Sean]
Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

[Hook 2:]
So I'm a drink and smoke and fuck and go go go
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
Like it's all I know, all I know
All I know, all I know -ow -ow
-ow -ow -ow [x8]

[Verse 4: Wiz]
While I'm flying over Italy, flying over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know
Khalifa got, I stay high like Pluto

[Verse 5: Sean]
Okay, I'm going hard (I'm going hard), I'm going dumb (I'm going dumb)
I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)
I got a lot to say, I don't hold my tongue
I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the policeeeee

[Hook 2]


[Intro: Sean]
After God, after my family, I ainât gonâ front
Ainât nothing more important than this success, than getting it

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas thatâs gonâ ride for me
Where my fine freaks thatâs gonâ ride for me
Where my real niggas thatâs gonâ ride for me
Where my fine freaks thatâs gonâ ride for me

[Hook: Sean]
Ainât nothing more important than the mula
Ainât nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, Hallelujah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tell the police Iâmma stack this paper âtil I overdose
Whoa-di, ho-di, slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I over flow, all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom, now they call your shit the Holy ghost
M-M-Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes, if her life ainât sweet, they gonâ desert me
Shut the fuck up, and stand up when you see me, like Iâm the verdict
Thatâs respect, now I got your wifey, and you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling, tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a fuck you fee, and make you pay your tax today
Iâm on a secluded island, swear it feel like castaway
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
âTil I rest in piece, get money recipe
Told my mind get what you want, then just leave the rest to me
Ainât no motherfucking rest for me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Ainât nothing more important than the mula
Diamand rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got polished cribs all in my name
Got them Mâs all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat
Went shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ainât everything homie, itâs the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ainât brolic, Iâm just chasing them commas
My niggas rock that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ainât nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]


I look up

[Hook:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Tequila glasses, shots to the head cause some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp an eigth of gin I have my friends
Gone, Gone
Man fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
Cause when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers trynna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first

[Bridge:]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Hook:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did

[Bridge:]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?

[Hook:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now
There's no turning back now


[Intro:]
Yup, yup
I look up
Cause I can't look down on you bitch niggas no mo, man
If that casket ain't 24 karot gold when I die
Then I ain't made enough fucking money man and that's real talk
God

[Verse:]
This my roll weed time
Don't turn it into dead in the street time
Her legs do the peace sign
Know the hood so well don't need street signs
Young rich and iconic
Big titties I'm signin'
Burnin' bitches and chronic
Big white smoke clouds every time I talk, does it look like I'm in a comic?
Everything I rock I designed it, realer nigga, won't find it
Okay, I be stackin' that cheddar, bet that shit won't expire
Got me ballin' so hard, I need me Jerry Maguire
I made a mil before twenty-five, man and I ain't even no lie
Bitch I ain't sayin' that shit to brag neither, I'm sayin' that to inspire
I'm like, damn boy, fuck you sayin' boy?
Hatin' on me, knowin' that you is a fan boy
When I'm around you call me Cause like we fam boy?
Rappin' like me let's me know that I'm the man boy
Okay, Hennessy and Bombay is a real nigga entree
I gave her my grande, my food is picante
My girls is Beyonce, your boyfriend beyond gay
I seen him hang with Deandre and they was lookin' like prom dates
One time for my hood 'til I go in the ground
I'm throwin' it up cause they holdin' me down
I'm perverted as fuck, got a pole in the house
Got your girl and your girl and they hoein' it out
But you standin' outside cause no hoes is allowed
If you work like I work, you would throw in the towel
Once you get in this life, man, there's no comin' out
And haters look at me like snow in the south
Surprise nigga
Man fuck it, I'm on, you off and I hope you die nigga
Why you alive nigga?
I'm stackin' dough cause my momma addicted to spas
Yeah I'm the one that these hatin' niggas despise
You better take off your fuckin' disguise, nigga
Bitch-made it's in your eyes nigga
Lies nigga
Shut the fuck up, everything'll be fine
Cause this my roll weed time


[Verse 1]
Welcome to Hellâs paradise
I always heard life was a pair of dice
Seven Eleven, or a pair of eyes
As Iâm looking at her smearing eyes
She yelling take them glasses off your eyes are the only things that not lying
Not caring to the point that I stopped lying
I tell her I feel the same
She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one thatâs not crying
You said you wasnât on no steal your man shit
If I broke it off now we wonât be on some friend shit
Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit
I broke the levy to your eyes
That I donât give a damn shit

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Time after time, itâs the same old shit
I think it might be too late, for me to learn from my mistakes
I knew that it hurts, I knew that it hurts you
But you should have used your head first
This might be the biggest mistake, itâs too late
Because two canât be in first place

[Verse 2]
Wake up then, Call your ex and make up then
What was no strings attached got tangled when
Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy, and Iâm already not one
She said we lost a kid already, Iâm already not that young
My biological clock is ticking, Iâm not just trying to have fun
Shits way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return and fix it
She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today
You the man, Huh? Getting all the TNA
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?
And so on and so on, and the shit just always goes on
Nothing about us feeling right
But sheâll be back before the end of the night

[Hook]


Yea, what up! It's Common right here! Y'all know where I come from, and uh, shoot I used to come to the D. I used to go to Detroit, like, every two weeks to record with J Dilla. I be standing at the Atheneum, and then, you know, he'd come scoop me up; he had a Range. We'd either eat, we'd eat at a Coney Island, close to his crib. He stayed 'round McNich'. We'd go down in his basement and stuff, and Jay Dee would dig through the records and then he would make a beat. And then once he make a beat, I'd be like, "Yo that beat cold," and then I'd just sit there. And Frank, Frank would be around. And then you know, and we'd just be kicking it; I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff, and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to strip club. And I wasn't all into the strip clubs at the time, so I'm like yo, I'd just be like, I'd sit there and be like, "I'm about to write this rap." Then one time I was like, "I'm going to the strip club with y'all." I went to the club, and man they had some good chicken wings, man some good, thick girls, and it was right. Anyway, I love the D, man; We used to kick it off in the D. That was like all day. That's what we do.


Ye it's so cold in the motherfucking D
I'm talking real cold man I'm talking about June 19 motherfucking 86
On a west side off 8 mile road
Living with my pops while he was working at a motherfucking post office
Right around the corner I was working at McDonalds
Getting up in the morning doing that breakfast shift
I was so cold in the motherfucking eggs, they call me young eggs
I mean I had it locked and loaded I was gonna fuck around and go to school out there
To the coaches wanted me to come to Cody High and play basketball
And do my thing, but you know what man, the experience I had in Detroit was a hell of an experience man
'Cause it shaped me, it molded me, it grew me
I came back from Detroit I was new and improved
I remember I wrote me a song, I said I went to Detroit to make my move a more track
Now I'm back and I'm new and improved
That's how I came back from Detroit you understand me I was new and improved
So all to my folks out there in the D, it's so motherfucking cold from the west side to the east side
Y'all know what it is, I used to stay on white street on the east side
Right by the east line mall you dig
So I mean I'm well routed, and tutored and suited and booted
Part of the D, it's part of the G and the LBC
This is Big Snoop Dogg, Big Sean you know what it is
Detroit, let's go.


Yea, you know what this is, nigga. You know who this is. That's right, Young, nigga. I'm like one of Detroit's own, you know. I fuck with the D so much cause, you know, it's a natural place of born hustlas. You know, real niggas, money go gettas, against all odds, you know. I remember the first time I came to the D for a show, you know what I'm sayin'. Um, I hit the homies up, let 'em know I was in town. I was sitting at the Atheneum, and mufuckin' um, the show was over at the Zoo Bar, and nigga we walked - literally - 300 deep to the club, all black tees. Matter of fact, we walked back from that mufucka, you know what I'm sayin'. I went and did my show, repped out, you know what I'm sayin', walked back to the hotel, hung out... for a minute and niggas was like, "Yo, let's hit the Sting, " and I'm like, "What the fuck is that? " "It's like a strip club in the hood. That shit stay open every night." I'm like, "Shit, that's right up my mufuckin' alley, " you know. But you know most of all, you know about the D, I got mufuckin' niggas in the D that I really love and fuck with genuinely, nigga, as they fuck with me befo'. You know, it was really rap shit. You know when I was trappin' mixtapes, niggas in the D was fuckin' with me like I was from 7 Mile or some shit, you know what I'm sayin'. West Side, Southwest, for real. I was tellin' a nigga Sean, I'm like, I said, "Nigga, it ain't a lot of superstars in the D." I was like, "Nigga, they got you and Eminem, but other than that, nigga you know, they got street legends, nigga. You know, niggas who really done that shit. Got it in, ya feel me? " What up, doe!


[Hook: Big Sean and James Fantleroy]
I woke up
Boy itâs time to get it
Walking to the window, saw the city
Thank God I woke up
Feeling like the mothafuckinâ realest
Living but itâs time to make a killing
Thank God I woke up

[Bridge: Sean]
Tryna get it every day
Make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)
Tell these fuck boys they gotta pay
Tryna make a hundred mill and run away, way, way
(I woke up)

[Verse 1: Sean]
I woke up, woke up, thank God I woke up
Wifey at home but Iâm living life like we broke up
You hit the hood and post up, Iâm gonâ get it âtil Iâm filthy rich
My hands dirty, my gross up, my money doing the toe touch
Thatâs stretched out, âtil Iâm in the back, stretched out, drinking Ace
âCause Iâm decked out, whole hood with me
Need a guest house, yea a guest house
Lately I been getting like moâ ass and less mouth
âCause when they see that whip, they start to think about kids
Man, when they see this crib, they gonâ start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now itâs time to live
Respect out the D, hardly had a pot to pee in
Now Iâm at the Coliseum, lilâ niggas gotta see him
Tryna be him, show you how to follow vision, real nigga
Politician, bad bitch, swallowtician, gotta get it
Yea (yea), last night I lost all that
Iâma wake my ass up, get it all back, thank God

[Hook]
[Bridge]

[Verse 2: Say It Aint Tone]
I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, living like I wonât see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when Iâm in the game, I TD
And Iâm all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, thatâs 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front
I fuck Kim K hoes, thatâs Jay âYe tone, smoking weed, thatâs reggaeton
Get it next to free, thatâs AJ tone, whatâs my name
Whatâs my name bitch? Sayitainttone, what she saying? Sayitainttone
Who they playing? Sayitainttone, fuck sleep that take too long!

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
I woke up this morning
Looking at the city that raised me
I can get it all now
And go get everything they never gave me

[Verse 4: Early Mac]
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
Iâma do dessert first, I donât even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, itâs a couple K
On the lake, Iâm out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, Iâm saving the day, and Iâm getting bank
Iâm foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I poâ up
Ok itâs Early Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
Iâm fooling

[Hook]


Ay, ay

[Chorus - Big Sean]
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Rick Ross]
I play the keys handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet as cantaloupe
Hit the road key of coke in the mantle fold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once trust it would make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, all gold shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tipping strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talking shit but I could get her titties lifted
My new crib got it's own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor
Wet as salt water
Ima boss, I'm just playing hoes (holes) like a golf course

(Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money)
[Big Sean]
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Chorus - Big Sean]
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Pusha T]
One hundred keys
One hundred please
My gazuntite could make a whole city sneeze
Walk the mud jungle where they grind it out the leaves
So they swarm to my honeycomb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sounds like
Money counter sound bytes
Machine gun fire
Name ringin' through like the town like
Church bells ringin'
Know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees
I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
Iron Man Audi, let the top strip tease
My life is slow motion but the watch screaming freeze
Yeah, young nigga gettin' money
The feds dragged neck, couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em wrapped like a mummy

[Chorus - Big Sean]
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Big Sean]
Boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
The guests look like a hundred lights
Man when blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred types
Every wrong I do, I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got it for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they ride Pintos, and could afford Enzo's
'Cause everybody know, keys open doors (keys-keys open doors)
But bricks open windows
Countin' a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4x4's (truck)

[Chorus - Big Sean]
I'm from a big city
Tryna make a living
Come to my hood
Everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push a hundred keys and it sound like
Young niggas gettin' money, young niggas gettin' money
Just a bittersweet symphony


[Hook]
I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 1]
And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old!
Table full of new hoes, champagne, Nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in him
She got no companion, she's Jennifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend!
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And it's all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!

[Hook]
Cause I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 2]
I'm in love with the money..
They say that it's the root of all evil
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us
But he will pass around that collection plate
Till it's heavy way as soon as his speech through
Then hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
But how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo, a depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zino
Most comfortable behind the mics like Tito
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito

What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And it's all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!

[Hook]
Cause I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 3]
I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid signed checks right after the contract
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meet
It's funny now when I look back
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs


[Hook:]
Ass [x22]
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...

Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

[Verse 1:]
Wobble-dy wobble-dy wa wobble wobble
I'm sta-stacking my paper my wallet look like a bible
I got girlies half naked that shit look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your ass is colossal, like whoop
Drop that ass make it boomerang
Take my belt off bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy tow tippy tay you gonna get a tip today
Fuck that you gonna get some dick today
I walk in with my crew and I'm breaking they necks
I'm looking all good I'm making her wet
They pay me respect they pay me in checks
And if she look good she pay me in sex, do it
Bounce that ass it's the roundest
You the best you deserve a crown bitch
Right on that,

[Hook:]
Ass [x22]
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...

Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

[Verse 2]
Stop! drop it drop it
You got everybody in here oh my gosh-ing
Bad bitches I'm your dada, white girls go gaga
When the stick is out they bust it open like yaya is a pinata
Bitch look down, tell me what's up
Girl you talk too much, shut up
I got that mad dick you know it always nut up
And it got a attitude no wonder why it's stuck up
Pop it then backflip, yo gymnastics got me ecstatic
Your whole crew look like a pageant I'm dropping cash tip and some taxes, woop
Girl you got me about to pass out
I'm wondering if cupid gave you ass shots
Because I'm in love with that,

[Hook:]
Ass [x22]
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...

Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

Woah, white girls, black girls, tall girls, fat girls
Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass
Go, go

Shake that ass shake that ass, shake that ass
Shake that ass, shake that ass, shake that ass

And I want all of that,

[Hook:]
Ass [x22]
Stop... now make that motherfucker hammer time like...

Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid

Go stupid!


[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see 'em so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust, okay
I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit, and I'm still here, right?
And motherfuck your friends
All them hoes hatin'
If you're not down, then what's your location?
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man, you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from "I love ya" to "Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with"
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?
If you wanna leave fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
I be right back in bed witchu
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishin' I would've tried more
She wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more
'Cause when I was true, all I heard was bye more,
Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feelin' like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'ed up
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinkin' "Damn boy, grow up! "
And I could still hear her leavin'
Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not workin'
'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?
And if you wanna stay, fine

[Chorus]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It'd wouldn't be so hard to leave
'Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
'Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night, I be right back in bed witchu
I be right back in bed witchu
So don't tell me you love me

So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do
So don't tell me you love me
So don't tell me you love me, whatever you do, whatever you do
So don't tell me you love me


Yo! It's money time!
Yezzir...

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the hoes, screaming "ho! "
That nigga go, go for the goal

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, B-I, B-I, bitch I do it to death
If I come in with half, bet I leave with the rest
OK, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent! "
Got a million on line 1 and
Another mil' dialing in, momma on line 4
Telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we about to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I just I just gotta have it, imagined and
Made it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches
Get casted, I'm in a race with myself to see
Who could get it the fastest
HUH
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check
With no ink - I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more

All the hoes! be Screaming "ho! "
That nigga go, go from the goal
Get it, get it, nigga we gonna get it
Get it, get it, nigga you gonna get it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at a life you've never seen so close
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, that you got to fake a accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Big's, and greatest of all Sean's
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check
With no ink - I get it

[Hook: Pharrell]


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me

And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga Mayne

Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch

Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams

Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big, and I never plan to down size

Ohhh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the o, even my fans smoke it

Hidin' it when I travel in case the police gotta know
Rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest

[Chiddy Bang:]
I'm fly, my swell on priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just right rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a Peter Pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud years, worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it come to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fade to licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L

Man these hoes take yo money

Woah, I'm sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwin house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus

She put that thong on my groin groin
And then it go boing!
Got my fronter on her bumper does it look like she toying
I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib
And party hard like I'm finna do it bid
All I ever do is big
So all she wanna do is big
Girl, what your name is, I really can't remember
And tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I'm up up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus
Bitch stand back watch how a real nigga do it (bitch)

I say
Iâm still dreaming bigger than Iâm living
And just sleeping long enough to dream
Spent long enough in the sheets
Itâs time to turn it to the real thing
And turn these ideas to milliâs
Business in the buildings
No girlfriend, youâre looking for some feelings
Find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world
Shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans
I made âem all fam
And came back to the city
That made us all men
Except we kings now
Reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall
Iâm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons
Dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life
So Iâm inviting yaâll to get in
Letâs go


[Hook: The Dream]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said "hi" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from? "
Plead, The Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Like a young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D
I do it

[Hook:]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now

And I'm a need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life...
Let's show em how to live this life
Show em how to live this life
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life...

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hell yeah, nigga gone right now
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm tryna to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
Stress turned me to a weed-head
And parties to an alcoholic
And money turned me to a workaholic
And money turned her to a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, yeah do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
It ain't about the cars, bout the nigga that's up in it
Right here: and all I need is a minute
Start it up, guaranteed I'm a finish
In the nighttime, and I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucker ice cold
My jewelry game ice-cold, stone white albino
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give em a light show

[Bridge: The Dream]
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

[Hook:]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now

And I'm a need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life...
Let's show em how to live this life
Show em how to live this life
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life...

[Intro: Kanye West]
Yea
You a nigga don't really wanna take his cool off, ugh
(Big Sean) Boi, Do It
Let's go

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time (yeah)
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye West:]
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Yeaaah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She love the way I'm doin' it
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?)
My bitch
Hold up, hol' up, woah there
Let's capture this moment if I hit it then I own it
Marijuanin every mornin'
And Patronin', girl, we groanin'
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on
Street lights on, on?
Cause' ya know I got it goin' til' it's...

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up
Talk to the, talk to the,.. hand
Bitch, you talkin' to a grown ass man
It's, like way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Err'ybody rip the swag off
'Fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off, cause I'm rappin' my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fuckin' anthem, get it, the fuckin' anthem

[Chorus: Roscoe Das]
Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye West:]
I don't really wanna uhh... talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when ya blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half asian
And we 'bout to have a liason
She's so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it's just so amazing
So amazin'
So amazin'

[Big Sean:]
Take it to the car, (bloop, bloop), that shit look like I'm speed racin'
Leave em with me, it'll boost your reputation
Westside is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it til it's...

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the mornin' (mornin')
When she's all alone (when she's all alone)
I'm a take my time
Do it how we want it (do it how we want)
Just to set the mood girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play
The long way
The strong way
It's our day
It's our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay.


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So goin and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They say the sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Hook:]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories

[John Legend:]
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great
How many missed calls til you considered fake
How many dreams til it's considered fate
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...

[John Legend:]
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal Twenty Dollar bills right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories...

[John Legend:]
Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back


Do it
Nigga fuck yo bitch nigga

Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to, shit
Nigga, Whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

Yellin', whose house is this? Huh
Bitch, Do I even gotta ask now?
Who the fuck are you? Do you even got you a pass?
I don't know why you cuffin' yo girl, she ain't even got her no ass
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers
Not only did I beat the odds, I also got even
Took a spot up on the throne, I see myself see myself
Said it twice 'cause history repeats itself 'peats itself
Man I can't even lie, I be high I be high
Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly
I'm out of here, like outer wear
We are not the same, you are not a player
My house is somewhere off in the woods, girls in my bed like I'm papa bear
They say hard work pays off, wrong it pays good as hell
You the man huh? Sorry I couldn't tell
Claimin' that they BIG, well I really can't lie
From the top they all look the same size

Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to, shit
Nigga, Whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

I start my mornin' with the paper
Bitch I'm rich free press, hundreds on all the pages
And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA
These niggas call me cause but I don't know why, cause we can't relate
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V8
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jurys
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes

Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to, shit
Nigga, Whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

I'm a go hard till it hurts off in this muthafucka
I'm a ball so you gotta work off in this muthafucka
The work, and I can get you anything you want
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on
See you look like Beyonce so do it like Beyon...
Do it, do it like Beyonce and put it on Sean
Grind hard but got a lot to show for it
Always had drive like I had to chauffeur it
My team's so true we should get a camera crew
To follow us around and make a show for us

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last

I'm a, I'm a blow dis backup like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a spend this cash up like it's my last
And I'm a make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan
Now she all up in space
All, all up in my face like "you remember who I am"
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louie Vuitton shine
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the Wonton (what's good)
Rozay rose or a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Man I just ended up on er'body guestlist
I'm just doing better than what everyone projected
I Knew that I'd be here so if you asked me how I feel
I'm a just tell you, it's everything that I expected
Bitch!

(Boi, Boi) [repeats on background]

[Chris Brown:]
Hands up in the air
(One time for the West side, west side, let me see them)
Hands up in the air
(Two times, two times if you love good music)
Hands up in the air
(And three times for the baddest chick in the World who got her)
Hands up in the air

[Hook: Chris Brown]
I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all

[Bridge:]
Big ass bottles, big ice buckets
I work too hard to be ballin' on a budget
Me and my people do it big out in public
Cause if you don't do it big
Bitch you ain't doing nothing

[Hook: Chris Brown]
And I'm a hit this drink up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this night up like it's my last
I'm a, I'm a hit this ass up, like it's my last
I swear I'm a, swear I'm a do it like
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all
All, all, all, all, all all all all
Like I, like I never had it at all all all all, all all all all


Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice
Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives
Like why? cause I stunt, bags of trees, like it's fall
The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard
And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge
They gave us a bridge card, nigga
Ridin' low, puffin on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me get a job, save up for a 401 (k)
Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' $401k.
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs
B-I

(Been this way before)
(Dream of having so much more)

But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred (I deserve)

Throwin' westside up like Pac, when they pop ya block up,
B-blocka, Big Poppa flock off, you holy, lil wodi, holy cannoli, chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I betchu that you won't find it
Rocking Louie and MCM
Guess I'm closed (clothes) minded
Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?
24k for the fit because it's 24 carats
And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin'
And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I loved Ashlee Marie
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy
Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy
And the whole world seen me
Bitch I know you seen me

(Been this way before)
(Dream of finding so much more)

"Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring"

Tell me that wasn't verse of the year
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up
Man I turned impossible possible
And what these niggas can barely see in the optical
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
And said I'm throwin my life away if I drop outta school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything that they told me not to do
After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules
Little hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication
I'm yellin' fuck em all, with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'm a be the man til my fucking expiration

B-I-G, I do it
This goes out to my muthafucking city
Detroit, Westside to be exact
Right over there on Northlawn...

[Outro]


[Chorus]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
[x2]

I hope it's not too late
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Ridin in a Chevy that should've been a Mercedez
Tryna keep my head above water
So I stayed out the navy
I, I, I made a promise to my girl
Said Imma leave town and bring back the whole world
So I bought a ticket
Took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace
And the first thing she said, was (it's too late!)
Like nigga, I got needs too
I found a man who gave me what I need
Now I don't need ya
I barely gotta text the call back
You ol lying ass nigga
You're a dog
Out here chasin paper
Fuckin bitches
Nah
Nah nigga you're too late
Live with it
Now you got a roommate
My homie served ten years
It's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Ridin around doing my thing
Is it too late to be tryin to live dreams
Turn them up real
Reality is just a technicality
And so is being fake
So don't tell me that
I'm that I'm toooo late

[Chorus]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
[x2]

Alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak
I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long

And don't look too strong
Well how long would you take
Waitin's got me here in the first place
Another second maybe second
Maybe third in the worst case
Now we'll display
On my word plays
Moving weight
It's such a trap
Move and weight
You can't do that
I know I'm dope man
But I can't move crack
And is such a fraction
They way you thinking about your plans
But I tryna bring it back
Before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit
Lupe from Chicago land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers design both of the sedans
Ride with Mr. Right on time
Or stay Miss another chance, man
Re-direct it at the girls
Not an ultimatum
Just an option in this world
But things come and go
When the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing
A little late for a lot

[Chorus]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
[x2]

I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late

Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls
Is it too late even though I'm the shit
Is it too late to tell ya'll to suck my dick

[Talking]
Bitch
I do it too late for what
I want it I need it
If I need it I got it
Cause this how finally famous niggas do


Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me itâs time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me Iâm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me itâs not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me Iâm all you need

[Verse 1]
Understand, I am
The renowned, newest talk of the town
When errybody talk and just keeps on talkinâ about
Wassup? Tellinâ girls âYou should call if you downâ
And if my phone doesnât ring, then leave it after the pound
âCause I be up in the air, more than I do on the ground
My city is on my hat, and Iâm wearinâ it like a crown (Westside)
Youâre now rockinâ witâ somebody on they fuckinâ bidness
Watch me do it big, no pun intended (Boi)
See, I done seen nights turn to days
Love turn to hate, hugs turn to laids
Niggas turn to sirs, Andre to Spades
âCause when it turns real, thatâs when everybody turns fake
Instead of sayinâ fuck all âa yâall and turning away
Man, I was cool enough to say âFuck itâ and let âem stay
Fuck, I hate to say I told you so
So buying rounds is my way of saying âTold you, hoâ

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me itâs time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me Iâm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me itâs not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me Iâm all you need

[Verse 2]
Now, I canât tell whatâs a better accessory
My new watch, or the chick thatâs standinâ right next to me
Killinâ niggas at rap, but being the manâs my specialty
I love shitting on all my exes especially
Double shots, then re-reload
Letâs toast to the interns that made it to CEO
Boss player, collectinâ every single check thatâs owed out
Puttinâ on a show until everything is sold out
Man, Iâm chillinâ witâ Jays, âYeâs, and Common Senses
Itâs crazy when legends are peers and your competition
I would hate to be a almost nigga
I call ya that, âcause you gossip like yâall almost bitches
You know, went to school with Jay, and was almost Jigga
Or hooped against LeBron and would almost get âim
Yâall niggas make me realize how good almost isnât
Would hate to look back on my life and say âI almost did itâ
F-ck that, reflectinâ on the last chain I bought
They on my tracks, waitinâ on the next train of thought
Visualizinâ how the crown might be
Got the whole rap game tryna sound like me

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me itâs time to go
Tell me I gotta leave, then tell me I gotta stay
Tell me Iâm all you need

Understand that what goes around comes around

And I donât ever wanna come down
So, baby, tell me who the best
Tell me itâs not me
Tell me I gotta go, then tell me Iâm all you need

This dedicated to my ex girls, both of âem
Itâs also dedicated to everybody who be talkinâ shit behind my back
And then when I see yâall, yâall act like âAwww, Iâm so happy for youâ
Thatâs some bitch-ass shit, nigga

Understand that what goes around comes around
(This also dedicated to everybody whoâs fuckinâ winninâ today)
And I donât ever wanna come down
Baby, tell me itâs time to go
(Everybody gettinâ it)
(After niggas said you couldnât get it)

Understand that what goes around comes around
And I donât ever wanna come down
(G.O.O.D. Music and the best)
So, baby, tell me who the best
(No I.D.!)


[Intro]
Imma' be paid forever
I look up
Finally Famous Nigga

[Hook]
I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]
All this bread canât be good for my cholesterol
Donât come roundâ talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg
I canât lie bruh lately Iâve been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you, FF Imperial til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material til Iâm dead, Iâm living proof,
If you focus on whatâs in front of you and not whatâs in the peripheral
Itâs gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
Iâm bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMSâing, ho Hablo inglesâ
If police have questions they donât know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still itâs been depressed so long I canât even tell depression here
My homeboy still gonâ pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil cuz thought the fair was here
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who? My team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?

[Hook]


[Intro:]
Finally Famous in this...

[Verse 1:]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out.
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night it's all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had it all figured out

[Hook]
[?]

[Verse 2:]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lyin and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck.
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all trickered out
Even when it... all of it... when you still ain't got...

[Outro:]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame


[Hook: Miguel]
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything
And you

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige's crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn't get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically
Those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe it's because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like "let's go"

[Hook: Miguel]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful
Distasteful yeah I know you're not supposed to hate cake and eat it too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain't came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That's about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY,
I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city
I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn't honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said "how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?"
I was scared you'd find somebody who would treat you like they're supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when thanksgivings come around,
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it's back to the drama,
"No I don't know that number"
"Why the hell you text it?"
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless

[Hook: Miguel]

[Outro: Miguel & Big Sean]
Can't nobody do it like you do it, like you do it, like you do it, like you
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you
Me and my granny both agree
Damn you're such a G I'll hold you down forever, B

[Hook: Miguel]


[Chorus â Big Sean + Jhene Aiko:]
When you said it was over you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back, whoa.
Looking at my phone like she finna call back, whoa.
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now she would've sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
'Cause girls only say "Hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know the highs, the lows
It comes and goes; you say, "Be real." I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring. Funny, right?
And I never cheated. I mean, maybe once, twice.
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus]

[Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call
Miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ill, ewww
Time, kill, months, still
I got somebody baby mama calling me "daddy". Got me.
I drank too much, please call me a "cabby". Swerve
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy. Swerve
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screamin' 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga I don't even have you
How am I supposed to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "Ain't no woman like the one I got!"
But she be always worryin' about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
Schh, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
Schh, but players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus:]
When you said it was over you shot right through my heart 
Tunechi
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad; I could've/should've seen this coming right from the start 
Damn
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro 2x â Jhene Aiko:]
...Baby
Last time calling me "baby"
Last time calling me "crazy", "crazy", "crazy"


[Hook]
Tell 'em that I need more
Fire [x22]

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Dealt with real life shit, Manned up and got through it
I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, but still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord G's, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts
'Long as that weed and money chilling and the power
Bitch I need that fucking fire

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Right now, right now, right now,
I know it's been a long, long
It's been a long, long time,
A long time, I know it's been a long, long time

[Verse 2]
I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Can do anything in the world except not do it
Bought my fam new six star crib
Momma feeling like she jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say "whaddup doe?"
Horror movie nigga, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though,
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
The grandma sad when she saw my commercial
"Stop having people at your show that wasn't at rehearsal's"
Iâm tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late, when it's all finished at the endin'
After all bottles spill it, throttle gripping, models switching
Chin chilling in my villa, fucking like I tryna populate a village
I'm replenished, I done do it just for the money
Man, for the feeling, I made it through the...

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro: Big Sean & James Fauntleroy]
But it's never, never been to late
It's never, never been to late
It's never, never been to late
It's never ever been to late
Right now, right now
I know it's been a long time
I know it's been a long, long time
Just know it's never, never been to late
It's never, never been to late
It's never ever been to late
It's never ever been to late
To do what you wanna do
Fuck everything else


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

[Hook]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the [?] it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what why I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me
A couple others and dreams, would've seen me
Me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Movin, feelin hellish [?] with lemon, lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now?
Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now
How sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is
The troublesome chick, who throws fists
Sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up
But when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes
So dead it, shred it
Young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go
My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now,
But I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought
Don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the song's will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance
Not really a dance, more like a prance
I'm signing off with a crotch grab

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
GOOD music nigga forever
Understand?


Goddamn you got a lot of meat hangin' there (mmm)
You're kinda large
But when I look at a big, shiny, greasy dick like that (yeah)
My pussy almost jump out my drawers ooh shit
Ooh shit I can't wait (oh fuck yeah)
Oh I wanna simply destroy that motherfucker (ooh)
Ooh please let me enjoy this good big dick while it's here (oh my God)
Ooh I wanna ride this big [?]
Ooh I wanna put the dogs on the head of this good motherfucker
Ooh now look at here baby
If the jaws of my pussy start to grippin' (mhm)
Don't pay that no mind, it's just that my pussy done got nervous
And a dick like that will make any pussy excited
Ooh shit, I could take a little bit more of this good motherfucker (oh my God, oh God, oh shit)
Baby, oh (oh, oh, oh sh-)

"Control yo hoes, you let her talk to you crazy

You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off

So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear is like my stomach's made of Teflon
They like, "Boy, won't you get your rest on?"
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Sean Don sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin', time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it 'til it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Bridge â Big Sean & Kanye West:]
Hold up, tell me what you see
Pull up, (swerve) watch these motherfuckers freak
Why don't ya say what's up though when you see me in the streets

[Intro: Big Sean]
I done fell asleep fucking last night
Thatâs how much I donât sleep nigga
Finally famous nigga

[Hook: Big Sean x2]
And Iâll be goddamned if I didnât
Put the city on letâs get it
(alright alright alright, alright alright alright)
Letâs get it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasnât me, wasnât committed
I told my mom and my dad itâll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ainât a blessing itâs a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living thatâs the motto
And immaâ probably wake up tomorrow sayin, sayin

[Hook: Big Sean]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Lets get it, yeah be alright nigga
Itâs the motherfucking world nigga
Getcha some time to just do it how I done it
First up on the first causeâ first of all you gotta want it
Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
So room for, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23âs Iâm talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just donât get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think Iâm riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, causeâ immaâ grinder
Told my olds im hiding you here, so they wonât find you
What you know about a bag thatâs heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ainât talking no marijuana
Thatâs whats wrong with these niggas they think itâs about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think itâs about time

[Hook: Big Sean]

[Verse 3: Payroll]
They say itâs my time according to my Rolex
Iâm bout to fuck the game, then your ho next
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, Iâm pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
Itâs time for a new crib, itâs time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie thatâs just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood youâd say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though
The hustleâs who I represent, dope boys we in this bitch

[Hook: Big Sean]

[Outro]
Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now itâs the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years
The people of Detroit really going to have to stick together,
To make it through these tough times


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Ok, I love me some of yo mama, (oh) true that (true that)
Don't call me daddy, only she can do that
Ok, me yo mama be fuckin, boy you don't know nothin bout that
You seen her lookin all mad, ain't it time for yo nap?
You wake up, I'm back, eating up all your snacks
Don't ask for help with your math (stupid)
Ain't my fault you can't add
Don't be out here fake cryin, lyin
Up in the keyhold straight spying
Only knock the door if you dyin (don't you knock on this door)
I wish I could stay here forever (I love it)
You the only reason me and your mama ain't together
She's so much better than my old bitch
Man, I love that old bitch
I do

[Hook: Big Sean]
No stress, no drama, her kids hatin, they know I fucked they mama
I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama, I love ya mama

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
The way she bounce both cheekies, boy she freaky
Shoulda known she was kinky
When I walked inside the room and I seen her slinky (what the fuck?)
Even made me use my pinky, the way she teach me
It's just so dreamy, oh God, damn, man
I cheat on tests, cheat on hoes, I cheat when I can
I'm even cheating on my whip, I got a side Benz
But she made me wanna cut off all my side friends (I love you, baby)
A nigga be tryna taste her, take her
Date rape her, stand out the daycare, sit there and wait there
Fuck, I can't even trust the neighbors, damn (what you lookin at?)
You niggas stick to your young hoes
I got a freak that wash, dry, and fold clothes
You motherfuckers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I got my welfare check, smokin on that crack
Hell yeah, I'm unemployed, baby daddy-down my back
Now what you got for me Sean? I heard it's big and it's long
I take my teeth out, suck it good, that's where your dick belong
Yeeeaah, do it like that daddy
Pump pump bump bump it in my ass-matic
You a dummie, you is big bone
(Mom, I'm hungry) Shut your mouth, you little bastards go on!
All this ass is for you Seany, can I call you Seany?
Sl-Sl-Slap me in my face with it
Get a crack vile with that bass in it
If I got weed then I'm lacin it
Eat all this ass, quit tastin it

[Verse 4: Juicy J]
I got yo mama all in my line
Bullets all in my 9
Rollie tell the time
She ain't yours, she ain't mine
Throw a hundred every time
I think my coupe just lost it's mind
Put yo mama on that trippy shit
Sippin lean, snorting lines
Overseas like bonjour
Last ten years I've been on tour
And I still got that old money
I touch more green than a lawnmower
With a ratchet bitch, you laid up
I'm on my tour bus fucking mamas getting paid up
I take that bitch to my mansion
And a nigga can't pay her to leave
Yo mama a great head doctor, (groupie!) with no PhD
My pockets stuffed with dough
I made it all in the streets
I might just go to the club, and throw it all on a freak
Yo mama
Ratchet ass bitch


[Intro:]
Whoa
Oh God
How I look, Tell me how I look
Exactly

[Hook:]
Mona Lisa, Lisa Moanin'
Got some drinks and some motherfucking refer blowing
I tell her fuck with me and you could be something
Yo girl so bad I want the threesome
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Look at my watch 'bout three somethin'
Threesome trying to have a threesome
Fuck with me and you could be something

[Verse 1:]
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we got to fuck her
That's what I'm down for no convo, my condo
And if I answer this phone call don't make a sound ho
My life is my audacity my dogs to the right of me
I got the girl you can't lay a finger on right here massaging me
Like yeah... I'm the nigga I know it, I'm the nigga I know it
My Momma say I'm a poet, you hating praying I blow it
But this the life I made though
I show a bad bitch what she made for

[Hook]

[Bridge]
(Bad Bitches [x4])

[Verse 2:]
I'm eating lobster with my shrimp hand
Feeling on her with my pimp hand
I'm talking to her like her Daddy do
And bet she give me everything but attitude
Mathematical, radical
Twist my fingers up and rep my avenue
Penthouse altitude, being broke is not compatible
Get a fine girl, Patron that
Get a finer one, and then clone that
You cuff your wife like I want that
When I got freaky women tongue kissing
Marijuana lung lifting
Give long dick then I'm long distance
You in the club bromancing
I got her homancing
Face in my lap nose dancing
No pants screaming

[Hook]

[Outro:]
I believe in God and rubbers
Even if we sex you are not my lover
Hit you on the couch and not the covers
And if you bring you friend then we


[Bridge: Big Sean]
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride for me
Where my real niggas that's gon' ride for me
Where my fine freaks that's gon' ride for me

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
I'm with my shooter and a preacher hallelujah
When they view ya fucking around
Me and my niggas we come in your town
Busting them bottles and fucking your bitches
And when they start hating we gunning them niggas
Don't fuck 'em around, boy I get money all day
And I ball hard like Tim Hardaway
I can see a bad bitch from far away
Let her ride this dick cause I had a hard day
And my dick even harder, you whippin' the charges
You put your rims on and you think that you're balling
I'm whippin' a Bentley, I can't even call it
And my shit so retarded I handicap parking like SKRRRRRR!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I get paid to the decimal, taxing plus stacking
Yo fuck federale, I smoke medicali
B-I-G Sean don, Juan Perion
Bitch fuck with me, I bet I make it work
I oopsy-daisys on a skirt
Fuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt
I prefer Brown liquor, Brown ladies, Brown Louboutin
Condom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform.
Nigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches
By candle lit, and that's cause the power's out
And not for romance and shit (No!)
From barely managing to mansions
Where ho's call me Mr. Anderson
Command a bitch, no I don't own the pussy I just sample it
I got a couple marbles missing I know
Now there's marbles all on the floor
On the bathroom, kitchen and stove
I got bitches on my cellular callin and confessing
But I don't reply cause that's the clearest way to send a message
Paper running through my jugular
I'm blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk
You know my style
And my momma say she still proud, that's mula

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(2 CHAINZ)
I'm winning, I don't owe a nigga shit
Came in this motherfucker by myself
Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH
My gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine
Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline
And I touchdown, goalline, y'all ain't, killing, shit
Shoot every nigga in your clique, I'm on one, let me jog your memory
Me and Nells on a milerun, uh, shawty gonna need her drawers done
Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh
And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me
Two niggas with guns, natural wallet
That pickpocket want my I.D and I spray your zone
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new chomp, I need that bitch that want a tag on
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
So I'm about to be, dumb as fuck, cause' I got blessed fools and babies
When I was fifteen I was felon,
When you were fifteen you were yelling
Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Earlly Mac]
Scared money never gon' make nothin', (that's right)
Gotta get it my medula
Couple dollars in the waist band, (that's right)
Nigga hula-hoop with the mula
Everyday that I wake I say grace
Hallelujah welcome back like Mase
Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream
A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date
Ay, they say we can't maintain
Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With twins so big she can put it in her ugh
Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like
When I see her camel all I wanna do hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'm a legend
From the motor city and been have drive
I just need a little gas in my engine
Okay, we all in the game we ballin' the same
Home team nigga that's a blessing
I'm a bad mothafucker just tryna get some credit
So good it can get my into heaven, nigga

[Hook x2]


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on
Whats up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: "Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday"
Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass
Then called him back like "Fuck, let's do it"
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursuit it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, "Let's do it"

[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
(BIG! SEAN!) [x5]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches,
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone
That could've come from out the Simpsons man
Who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it,
Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot, but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, Now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, But time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say "Aye dawg, What you got?", "Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, stay young ran the game, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem, it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in,
I ain't even let him finish shit, I mean I can't lie he was alright
But at his age, shit so was I,so give him my email on a fly
And if it sound good, then I reply Uhh

[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]
[Trick Trick:] Hello
[Shorty:] Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga
[Trick Trick:] Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?
[Shorty:] Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg

[Both:] Hahahaha
[Shorty:] But that nigga was cool though man
[Trick:] Alright!
[Shorty:] Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars.

[Outro 1: Big Sean]
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry.

[Outro 2: Mama Myra]
I know you're not my child talking like that.
Focus shifting the negative energy, into something positive.
And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have,
For your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you.
You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay.
Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha


[Hook]
She tell me she love me
I'm everything that she want
Top floor, only way that we go
Diamonds and gold, Sierra Leone, Leone
Hotel look like Sierra Leone, Leone
Chain, ring look like Sierra Leone, Leone
And she don't ever tell me I'm wrong, I'm wrong
Cause she don't want to leave Sierra Leone, Leone

[Verse 1]
Get to it, I be getting to it
Hella groovin', rooftop, better viewin'
Always hella coppin', no propellers, moving bank tellers
Movin', youngin', revenuin', mozzarella chewin', you know?
Lobster butter basted
I deserve every crumb tasted, road to riches one way and
Sunbathing, tongue tastin'
After that she wine tasting, Sean tastin'
You know? I gave her diamonds and gold
That's Sierra Leone, her friends like "Girl don't let go!"
So she ain't askin', she ain't whinin'
Complainin' or trippin', man I got her damn near strippin'
For the handbag livin', Saks Fifth'n, tag rippin'
No more tab splittin', cab gettin', who wants to go back to that livin'? Do yah?
So let's sex on the beach
Then the rest on the sheets for the rest of the week, 'til

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What you know about wake up to fuckin' 'fore you even can stretch?
Yeah I'm on vacay and my dick still need a rest
I might get her on film, star and direct
Just might win an award if that shit hit the net
Oh, reclinin' in seats
Not liftin' a finger 'less I'm signin' receipts
Livin' life like I got a degree
Fuck it, I'm livin' life like I done got in the league
Look, my car look like it play for the Lakers
Credit card look like it play for the Raiders, I watch it play for the paper
Chandelier, marble floor on the feet
She said I'm a don, I gotta agree, I fuck her to sleep

[Hook]


[Intro: Big Sean]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it
I look up, I say I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PB & Jelly
She look back like "Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?"
I'm screaming "Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho"
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

[Hook:]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya
This is for the ones that's always riding with ya ain't switched
I ain't switched up naw naw I ain't switched up
Same me naw naw I ain't
Switched up
Same team naw naw I ain't switched up
I think it's time to kill it

[Bridge:]
Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it [x3]
I said I think it's time to kill it

[Verse 2: Common]
Bought a Cadillac, now I'm Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around (Oww)
I'm in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I'm 'posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and Divas, Plus some Cougars and Cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Benita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain't anybody fucking with my clique
And all these bad bitches man, they want the

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that's hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that's how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or be devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I don't
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends

[Hook]

[Bridge: Big Sean]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
Rollin' with the same team I ain't switched shit
I'm with the same OGs
The same old team, and you know my team
Ain't switched


[Refrain 1]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy

[Verse 1:]
Float around my town like it's the motherfucking seven seas
Hit the club, lose seven Gs, fill it all on seven D's
Spilling liquor rest in peace, rest in my G's, rest with her [?]
Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team
Same show, different seats, same game, different league
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see,
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Living life I hope that everyone I love will get to see,
Get to see, get to see, get to see, get to see
Bitch

[Verse 2:]
I was thinking about the ice that I put on, money that I've blown
Bitches that I know, everything that I've done wrong
All the licks I hit, all the bullets missed
Got my shit legit, a lot of people pissed, well
I got money coming through
Drugs and women coming too
Got my family living comfortable
Got me thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do
I'm doing what I'm supposed to do

[Refrain 2]
Hella cheese, hella trees, LSD
Selling D, feeling like the 70s
Getting paid like we seventy
Use to roll around in that Toyota rolling seven deep, damn

[Outro:]
Bitch
Bitch


[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down,
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright

[Hook: James Fauntleroy and Big Sean]
Now, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright
Cause, when the world's ablaze, the stars will fall
The lights go off
Say its going to be, alright
Its going to be, alright

Just tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be
Tell me it'll be, tell me it'll be [x3]

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
"Might not make it this time"
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, when they need a cure
I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said "Sean, you need a plan
Mrs. Freeman's son, across the street got shot,
Now she need a hand!"
Traumatized, gotta watch, his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, tell his momma lies
Like, "It's gonna be alright," knowing it ain't alright
I know there's just so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know I love you momma like she mine,
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
"This can't be my mom!"
Got me thinking, "whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again"
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out,
POOF! Disappear, God make an out!

[Hook]

[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Stay close to me, so close to me
That's how it's supposed to be
Long as you've been knowing me
You been holding me down,
I'm sure as fuck, so fuck hopefully
I watch over you, you watch over me
And that's how it's supposed to be
And we are, alright [x3]


[Intro:]
You know what you do
You know what you do
You know what you see
You know what you do
You know what you - you don't know what you do!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Whoa, then get fucked up and go get out of town (swerve, swerve)
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get
A pound is it, a thousand tears
Red cup yeah, that's college year
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's finally famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
And you don't know what you do!
It's just a feeling inside me
You don't know what you-

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every meal come with asparagus
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, oh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her mama, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do

[Hook: Ellie Goulding]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Go, go, go, go, go
Can't let the high go to waste I feel how I'm supposed
(supposed, supposed, supposed, supposed)
Man, watch your back I swear man some of these niggas be

But I'mma live this like I swear that's all I know
Know, know, know, know, know, know


[Kanye West:]
Yeah, you know we good
You talkin' about this shit but whatever
We can go back and forth all day

[Hook - Kanye West and Travi$ Scott:]
(How much I feel, I live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Kanye West:]
That's that don't play, whoo, that's that new Ye
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whoo
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house
Your house got another house
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine thats what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We bout to tear this whole place up pretty much
(How much I live)

[Bridge - Kanye West:]
And you know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe
You know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me

[Hook]

Ho we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder
You wonderin' how do you get in the game
I'm wonderin' how do I get to the rafters
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
Til I'm MJ or Magic, oh she just want the status, so
You the man she got, but I'm the man she been after
She done sent so many naked pics my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina
I'm the good with the evil
Fuck you nice to meet you
You can have a peace sign man without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree
They're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off even with diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it
Scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesar's
Piece of pizza with Tanisha
Now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah she actin' like a ho at that
Throw her to me I'ma throw that back
Top spot I'm finna go at that
(Straight up)

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Big Sean (Kanye West):]
Ho you gotta move quick
(World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips)
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Ho and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top 5 list
(I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list)
Til everything I spit is all timeless
(My girl on that all fine list)
My life a little luck, a lot of grind
Bitch no maybe ho I gotta make it
(Fuck your nomination man fuck the world)
I'm repopulatin', wrap my rollie round my waist yeah time's a waistin'
(Niggas want the comma, comma combination)
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot dot dot a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain plottin' world domination
(People ask me how I done make it)
I'm just like "man if you want the crown, bitch you gotta take it"
Straight up


[Intro:]
Look, I feel blessed
Way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed
Straight up

[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]
I live the life I deserve, bless
Fuck a vaca' I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth
I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gonna go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give em Heaven on Earth for a hell of a check
Yeah whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life man that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father forgive me these are all my confessions
Man this wasn't luck it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you dog
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was off for a sec now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want man this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man this is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta, thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God

[Hook - Drake:]
I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed straight up
I'm way up I feel blessed straight up, straight up, way up I feel blessed

[Verse 2 - Drake:]
Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammies go
I just gave out Grammies on my Instagram
Them OVO boys the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give
You gotta come to my side and see how we live
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried about my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit man

[Hook - Drake]

[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]
My grandma just died I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' overtime on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, man it's to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who put it back together

[Hook - Drake]

[Verse 4 - Kanye West:]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
C3POs like Star Wars
They want me by the road holdin' up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now callin' you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there gettin' homeschooled
I'm blessed, and I was thinkin' 'bout startin' up my own school
A Montessori, and the hallway lookin' like a monastery
Oh yes I'm way up, I feel blessed


I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official

I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it, that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe, like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like "this the girl I'mma take out"
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, all year
I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I started from the basement, made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
[x2]

Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, oh now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I be thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murder some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like "man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother"
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers


Do or die nigga
I'm a keep poppin' this champagne
Don't worry bout shit
(Finally famous nigga)

[Hook:]
Man I look up to God
I wonder if I fell from the sky
Will I hit the ground or will I learn how to fly
I'm pretty sure you see it in my eyes
Sometimes I wonder if I already died
That shit get deep, deep, deep
Man I swear to God that shit just get so deep, deep, deep, deep

Man I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped when then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
Yee'ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper don't even know it
It's written in the stars man the sky is the author
I pulled the sword out of the stone I'm King Arthur
Motherfuck your armor nigga, only weapon I'm scared of is Karma
You watching the son turn to father, fucking life and the daughter
Nigga that shit just get deep

[Hook - Big Sean & Lil Wayne]

[Lil Wayne:]
Been going hard all day, wish a nigga would fuck with me
Then I blow the candles out on my cake
And niggas always thinking it's a game, 'til we ran them out the arcade
Stunting in my southern player, reach the caddy like Andre
I talk that cash money shit
YM plus CMB you can do the math for me bitch
Jail time a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time, then cross it with pride
That's real my nigga, remember that
And ain't about if they remember you they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that
Cause this shit is deep, deep
Deep as empty pockets, nigga
We come empty pockets before we have empty pockets slime
That shit get deep

[Hook - Big Sean & Lil Wayne]


Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the ends of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now me out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lying, pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said "Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good"

[Hook - PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
Okay I came up how I came up
A little change bring change up
A little fame bring famous
A little danger now I'm dangerous
Gettin' high now I'm the supply now
Laying low cause it won't fade us
Deliver how I deliver cause nigga I need to
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it
Still feel like I deserve it
How I feel like I deserve it

Now I be fuckin' with these bitches like they hypo-allergenic
Women are from Venus, caught in love playing Tennis
Some hoes are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change
She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
"I'm so proud, seems like every where I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask"
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said "Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet"
Sign me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on here poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve

[Hook]


[Hook - Big Sean:]
I don't fuck with you
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do

[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you calling, I be makin' it quick
I'm a answer that shit like: "I don't fuck with you"
Bitch I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And everyday I wake up celebrating shit, why?
Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories, that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me, she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'm gonna text your ass back like

[Hook - Big Sean:]
I don't fuck with you
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do

[Verse 2 - E-40:]
Got a million things on my mind
Executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin hemp in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely hardly, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Pour up
Why you always coming around with bad news? (bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Asking if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that

[Hook - Big Sean:]
Bitch I ain't fuckin with you (bitch)
You little stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (aha)
You little, you little dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't I don't give a fuck
Bitch I don't give a fuck about you or anything that you do

[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip gotta thank the lot for
Yeah I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah we in the buildin' but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit everyday I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like I'm in the elevator
Yeah I know that karma too real so I hope you doin' cool
But still stupid ass bitch I ain't fuckin' with you (no no no)
Little stupid ass I ain't fuckin with
I ain't fuckin', I ain't I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you

Straight up
Yay yay
Whoa


[Pre-Hook:]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty

[Hook:]
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

Dancin', dancin' dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop pop pop like Pepsi Coke, the best we smoke
Plus that tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get
Bustin' wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes that y'all don't speak the same language
I know that you just wanna let it go with all the bitches that you came with

[JhenÃ© Aiko:]
I know you've been going through some thangs, wanna get away
Baby let me be your vacation
The other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin'
Baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's throw and we roll

Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card oh God I think I got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space
We can shoot up by the town
Have you ever been to Texas?
South By Southwest
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be that baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just got casted

[Big Sean (JhenÃ© Aiko):]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing
But no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
(I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main dang that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain)
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
(Don't love the same, I know you're diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you, I know you, I know you)

[Hook]

I know it look like you need a vacation
How 'bout Hawaii, maybe Jamaica, maybe Asia
Taking you places 'lotta niggas can't take ya
Don't forget the make up
Yeah


[Big Sean:]
They used to tell me, used to tell me
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day, you know?
My, my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day, no Kim K, but he bagged ye ye
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know 'bout wakin' up every day like you on a mission?
And I

[Kanye West:]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
One man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Big Sean:]
My grandma told me, "If you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out."
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they're broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have and then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye right there on Outer Drive
And she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise sayin'

[John Legend:]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

[Grandma:] Thank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about me
[Big Sean:] It's all good I love you grandma
[Grandma:] Bye


Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like "we don't got time for bullshit, dawg"
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the "um, you owe me" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
"Oh, you owe me likes"
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313
515-8772, bitch, call me


[Hook:]
I always wanted to stunt so hard
I always wanted to ride that whip
I always wanted to fuck that bitch
Thank you God, I fucked that bitch
I always wanted to live this life
I always wanted to wear that ice
I always wanted paradise
I always wanted paradise

Look, now it don't take a lot to make you rich
I'm addicted to a lot of crazy shit
Man, I feel like money is the best drug
Sometimes, hate can be the best love

Walkin' in like I got cameras on me
Niggas can't control me, ain't no handles on me
Shit don't get out of hand, it get handled, homie
Got a pretty young girl look like Janet on me
She a pretty penny and she know I'm doing numbers
Till we crash up the whole database
I bring it home like I'm base to base to base
Closet lookin' like Planet of the Bathing Apes
What you think this life just landed on me?
My whole city look like it's abandoned, homie
And we came straight out of those abandoned homies
Every wish we ever had got granted, homie
And I'll never take that shit for granted
Even when the marble floor and counter top is all granite
Back before I got paid any advances
Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing
Nigga, never did I slip or I panic
Even if I was the captain of Titanic
Riding through the north Atlantic, homie
I never jumped crew or abandoned, homie
All the fruits of my labor organic, homie
Making sure my family tree got hammocks on it
And a good guy can change, 'specially if he short-changed
So fuck is my ransom, homie?

Money bag, money bag, money bag
[4x]

[Hook]

Straight up, finally famous, nigga
I always wanted paradise

Aw damn I'm illuminated, man, I knew I make it
And I get that shit accumulated
Never throwing money out, I boomerang it
Finally famous over everything, that's a numerator
Weed lit, yeah it's luminated, room lookin' like it's fumigated
Bitch my crew invaded, when I walk in man, they body to body
Hol' up everybody, don't worry man I got it, I got it
I need a hundred dollar bill photocopy the email and copy
Man I'm going hard all season these hoes goin' both ways, offense, defense
Livin' life on the deep end, F-F allegiance
Beat the odds and got even
What you think, that we just started nigga?
Boy the sword just got sharper nigga
This ain't war we just sparring nigga
I was on the rooftop with my nigga
Mike Carson nigga, shootin' that Too Fake video
My nigga we all in, we set ourselves apart from all our apartments
What's up in Florida, no Marlins nigga
I'm that Shawn, no Marlon nigga
Look at my girl nigga, fuck yo bae list
Fuck yo night list, fuck yo day list, fuck yo playlist
I'm from the D, fuck your A-list
I been working 8 days a week
I don't even know what the fuck today is
I hit the booth and I just went super saiyan
I run with the purp like I play with the Ravens
These bitches ran a rave and
Hope I never have to go back watching, Everybody Loves Raymond
Eating ramen nigga, this paradise
Life's a fucking paradox, a pair of dice
If they not rolling with you, then they parasites
Nigga I had that vision, it was ClearSight nigga
Sean Don


Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Icebreaker and Girbaud was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress and undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade aids test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say "nigga, come roll"

[Break]

Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile
They call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods
Off on 11 Mile, better that, one time for the D
Girls that hold me down Corretta style
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking "fuck rap"
Cause there's niggas in the streets getting money under my nose that I mustache
I've seen people get murdered who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
That's why their attitude was "bitch, you deserved that shit"
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain the same brain and mind
In a city of AKs and K9s
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?


OK, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet
I'm the one you need alone
I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya
Finally famous

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
I ain't like them other niggas

You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya

With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya
I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya
As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya

I saw you chillin' with Meek Mill up at the summer jam oooh
I hope my eyes the one that's lying to me girl and not you
I know we all done got a past but there's shit that I can't pass
Seein' you at the soho house I know you can't afford that tab

Bad bad bad bitches they dressed up

And I bet that she ain't gonna be that late
For a young sexy face like me
A young young young sexy face like me
She like girls if she don't like me
And if you do then I do girl, I see ya, I see ya
The way that you pose I might have to IG her
Sexy young thing I might have to ID her
Ooh damn I got some Ideas
We could fuck up the couch in the club like it came from Ikea
Goin' so hard the whole night is a blur
Older women be like damn your mature

[Hook x2]

Ok, I sip the kamikaze while I bend the body
And I whip the Maserati like I'm Ricky Bobby
I be mobbin', I be mobbin' like I'm Gotti

50 women in the room like we ain't even got a lobby
I be wildin' like I never had a daddy
And the titties, paparazzi they be flashin', god damnit I'm a hottie
Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby
I ain't even gonna lie, I got a million dollar chick
With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz
They ain't gonna let you get the fountain in the front with the fist
They gonna give you courtside at the Clips
But never on the shit, they ain't on that gunner shit
Well fuck giving it to me, I'mma take that shit
Forget crackin' the code, I'mma break that shit
I'mma calamari steak that shit
And cause so much ice, me and my dogs gonna skate that shit
Bitch do it so big you can't escape that shit

Girls handing me their heart, how could I not break that shit?

[Hook]

[Refrain]


[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

[Verse 1 - Big Sean:]
Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on
You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV, touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, wow
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need to
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

[Pre-Hook - Big Sean:]
Is this the example I'm tryna set?
Are these the people I'm a forget?
Are these the times I'm a regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?

[Verse 2 - Big Sean:]
Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some
Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some
Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some
Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Man that's drama, drama drama
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma
I'm tryin, homie
But she always picks the wrong time, my phone's dyin' on me
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me
It sucks to hit the internet and see your lyin' on me fuck

[Pre-Hook - Big Sean:]
Is this the example we tryna set?
Are you the person I'm ma forget?
Are these the times I'm a regret?
Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but

[Hook - Big Sean and Jhene Aiko:]
You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life
I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right
(Okay, you got ahead tonight)
Man, that doesn't make it right
Man, that doesn't make it right
How do you sleep at night?


[Chorus: Mike Posner]
She loves me, she loves me not
I can't tell if she's down or not
Oh you like me?
What the hell does that mean?
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Don't be so ambiguous girl
Are we gonna fuck or not?

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Maybe I'm just dumb
But I can't read the signals that you're giving
I can never tell
If you're looking at me or Clinton
Is this the way that you talk to every guy that you meet?
Or do you wanna come back and stay up all night, all night, all night with me?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Baby what's your favorite drinks?
I think I'm about round of em all
I'm rollin up the bestest
Come help me blow a pound of it all
I'm on that up up extra line
You should climb up and be down with it all
Come here, cause we go hand and hand like round of applause
Showtime bitch, action
I think it's time for that night scene
She goes to sleep and dream about my sex
I guess it's her pipe dreams
28 but I'll make her feel like she 19
Trying to stick around like wifie
But I'll send her home in my white tee like bye, bye-bye, bye

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Clinton Sparks]
Now every time I see this girl
She be asking all type of shit
Where is it I'm going to?
And who is it I'm hanging with?
Can never tell if she's in to me
Or just want to be a friend to me
Mixed signals she sending me
Late night at the club drunk texting me
Like "can I come over your house? "
Ok but can I cum over your mouth
Smiley face, lol, back and forth
I can't tell without being conspicuous

[Chorus]


[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known

[Verse 1]
And God damn you all crazy ass

pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass
all up in Saks 5th when you deserve Macy's ass
talkin' bout shit, yea nigga, better pay me ass
bitch all up in my house and I ain't tryna room mate her
she in and out my drawers like its, like it's Room Raiders
she crazy and deranged, when she in the Range
skip the jewelry store and grab rocks
like she Tomb Raider (raider, raider)
but before you hit that Alter
and the preacher start pronouncin'
gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount
of whatever's in your account
so take that into account
and you best get to countin'
before you gets to bouncin'
bitch

[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker

[Verse 2]
Crazy, man I must be crazy too
cuz crazy as she is I could'nt leave her if ya paid me to
I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to
d-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82
(I like the you you do it)
she get it from her mama
headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama
man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money
not from you, yeah she get it from your Honor
believe that, fuck you get my password?
readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first
I know I should leave her
for damn sure don't, don't need her
everytime I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first

[Chorus]
Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker

Man I should've known, should've known, should've known
should've known, should've known
Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
(crazy, crazy, crazy)
she was crazy than a muthafucker


Catch me running to the money until my feet lose feelin. Stack it wall to wall till it's leaking through the ceilin. Man, All fucking hundreds so what's that like a zillion? Working grave yard shifts cause were finna to make a killin. Went from intern to the owner of the building. Bussin nuts counting money like oh what a feelin.
To be seeing what I'm seeing after I've seen what I've seen it's like acting out a scene from a dream of my dream.
I got a dream that's worth more then my reality, and pride that's worth more then a salary, and a text from the girl I love I stopped calling Quote "I hope it's worth all it."
Sometimes I feel I'm working just to work harder, and then work harder then who worked the hardest. man the life of a workaholic. You either on your work or just workin on it.
Man fuck it kill'em all we gunna need a ton of flowers. And if you need impossible give me bout an hour.

It's time to turn a polaroid to a portrait.
Rockin street clothes gettin money like I'm corporate. Young and gettin it, isn't life gorgeous.
Bet the crib on em and you'll end up with a fortress. And I'm a need that new condo, town home, brown stone should I fuck with the dow jones?
Or maybe I'll put money on the block instead?
There's no need to save, I could get change off the street next to the meter maid.
Cause I need a made house with a piece of shade. Butler doing such a good job that they need a raise. Bad chick with an angel ass and an alyiah face. Tryna show a little TNA.
Hell ya I'm tryna see the day
Man life is so bright when you don't see the gray. The new school appointed me to lead the way. A real nigga to the DNA.
Me mike grace and dilla stickin' to the script.and what's her name still lickin' on my tip.
Gon a head and tell these bitches who they fuckin with. Man to get where I'm at I'll make her suck a hundred dicks.
Man to get where I'm I'll make her suck a hundred dicks. Her mouth lookin like dannon because me and canon and to get where we at she had to suck a hundred dicks.
Man I got on versace shades,
Versace belt, versace shoes. I might've fucked around and been the freshest nigga in the world today.
You don't understand man I came from nothing. This what I dreamed about, this what we dreamed about.
Boy.
B-I-G Sean Don nigga.
Good Music.
Finally Famous in this gettin'... errthang.
Detroit whaddup though.


[Big Sean:]

D townn
Boyyy, hey
Ok, I'm smoking loudly I walk them all, I pick up that tree when it's not fall. I'm going off that tree when it's not tall. I'm in love with tree I'm a avatar. I pick up an O from my nigga ralphy, my bro and me but he is not alphy, going of that goo punch it makes me drouzy, roll up the window it makes it cloudy. Damnn, if you ain't know, I made these girl nice smoke paper and bowls, my ladies like blunts hit em twice if not once. I blow em off and just pass em to my bros. Now catch you getting brains if a nigga not learning. I spending money if a nigga not earning. Catch me in the backseat if I'm not stirring, and catch me rolling up if a nigga not burning.

[Chorus:]
I got five on it
Grab your 40
Let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it
It's got me stuck and not go back
I got five on it
Partner let's go half on a sac

[Chip Tha Ripper:]
You know a nigga like to stay at that cruising altitude up in the sky, try and fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high. Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarello smoke. If you say you take away the taste and get some better smoke. Cause this shit I blow can get smelt on the next block. Ain't no middle mans every thing you need is in stock. This gloc is all the security I need. I be solo, dolo, when you see me blowing on some weed. Watch me, no be, I be just taking it slow, I be so clean diesel over powers my cologne, now all the bad bitches who blazed on shit this way, you all just some white girls with leaves I am the sensai, now I bow to the bag never save the best for last, cause when I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass. Fuck a dime son, let's cop a quarter pound, what the fuck is you gonna put down. Nigga I got five.

[Chorus]

[Curren$y:]
How wired, 6-4 hydraulics. Now stolen lost my keys that was high platinum. Fuck you want, this the raw paper now the blunt you must got me mixed up with chip cause this spitter zig zag a whole zippa shit strung shoulda came with a big pick up. Bitches calling me, wanna smoke big and for me to pick up, she blow me while I'm blowing rings of that killa, then we just smoking brown. Fake weed to much make a clown. Get real smoking green strawberry fields. High standing up feeling like I'm laying down, couple bugee cuties came round acting stuck up now they just stuck from smoking with us. Had that hallways smelling as my windows opening up I inhale walk and talk as the security coming up.

[Chorus]


[Kanye West:]

I'm bout to fuck somethin up,
I might as well call the lawyer,
Good music run this bitch,
Yes we do,
I know you thinkin "damn I wish Ye would bless me too"
In the booth I use the restroom
It's best you, Go ahead and kiss the Jesus piece Cause I just blessed you,
Uhh, And holy water odds against Ye
It's slaughter ever since I opened up that midnight merrauder?
Now it's gon be a problem like a brand new installment from the late great Mr. Christohper Wallace,
They call us pompus,
Can I be honest? Honestly, Modesty wouldn't ever end my policy,
Apology accepted, you ain't say it? Shoulda said it,
As soon as I did, all the Bullshit was deaded.
Get it?

[Big Sean:]
Yup, Yup I get it,
Good music bitch, Ain't nobody fuckin with it,
And Nah, nah they can't really do it how we did it,
It's good music bitch, Ain't nobody fuckin with it,
B.I.G. is, gee wiz, he is sure he would be the man ever since a fetus,
I know us niggas prayin um down fallin weak shit,
But I'm never goin down hill,
Even on ski trips,
I am the d,
Come and make an observation
And it seem like the murder rate is higher than the population,
Damn, I bet you just as sweet as you look bitch,
You are just bushwick, I'm 8 foot 6,
I'm so up up on it like insomniacs,
Good music man Ye where he find me at,
I'm so dominant, I'm so confident
That I'm a get a compliment on any fuckin continent from freaks that's fine is shit without this designer shit,
Big business, respect my conglomerance,
Girls get check, but my bank get check more,
Whenever niggas check up, I'm who they check for, or have a check for,
Loui V shit so much domnier print fuck around and play check-ors,
And these rappers get critical damages, But I rap so good it's no need for bandages,
You the man in your city, Cool.
When I'm out performin? right after you,
I'm sorry but you gone be ranked right afta two,
Cause I'm first place,
And second is my crew,
So move, Bitch.


Man I got my dark glasses on
Cause I'm ready for the big lights
All my money counted all my rubbers skin tight
Me I always stood out you was more the in type
I never followed suit u were more like pin stripes
Riding ye's maybach smokin so it's cloudy
With 3 girls who spend all day doing pilates
Getting money niggas think I joined Illuminati
Throwin west side up I'm feeling like illuminati
Now isnt it ironic that I'm in a big body
Paranoid cause every rapper named big got bodied
Boy, and my bitch got body
But I sit her in the back cause my nigga called shotty
And I'm a g o till I'm a o g
Rockin something high end like a fuckin o.d.
They feel a nigga from ny to the oc
If we down in the 4th quarter I take it to o.t.
Then take it to 1 & o just take it to o & me
Chillin in a hot spot cause I never get cold feet
Nigga you on the side lines praying for an audible
Cause when your legendary everything is quotable
Boy, priceless is affordable
Order what you can afford matter fact order more
And I think I'm a have the same thang
My whole team gettin cash I just call it gang green
Big is on the track ye be on the track
Since when kobe and lebron hoop for the same team
Can live my life blindfold cause every time my eyes close
I just tend to fuck around and see the same thing
Yeah I just tend to see the same thing
They say it's meant to be when you sleep to the same dream
I hooked up with g.o.o.d and been living a changed scene
I'm tryna turn these grey clouds to vanilla skies
Camera in my face I guess the future will be televised
And I'm as underrated as the beat bitch
Fuck it if I'm underrated I stay on some g shit
Nigga I chief up it's December 25, 365 forever putting wreath up
And your girlfriend forever wanna meet her
Tryna see what is in common but my dick is what's between us
Man I break her heart everytime I change hoes
I make a new style every time I change clothes
Man they jock my rhymes every time I change flows
One of the few gettin change but won't change for it


[Verse 1: Suai]
Trying to write a love song
I wanted it to be just right
Tried to make it beautiful
But all I can think about is our last fight
I was gonna play it on piano
Had the drums come in real bold
But I couldn't think of anything good to say
So the big ballad strings will never get played
Pretty melody I wrote will never get sang
Piece of paper that I started with got thrown away
A song about our love will never see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

[Chorus:]
I was gonna write you a love song
But you screwed it all up
Playing games now you're just
A lame who's shit out of luck
I almost wrote you a love song

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
(Crazy ass bitch)
She threw my watch out the window
Chain in her hand
She running through the crib
Finding anything she can
Our relationship is not the only thing that's out of hand
She even called my momma like
'you need to get your man
Cause your son lying on me
I ain't trying to get a tan
And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands
So I'm heading to the club trying to find a man'
Bitch you headed to the club trying to find a man?
What is you saying?
Hoes and passionate night gowns
But you the only one I imagined in white gowns
So with your left hand you should let me add a ring to it
Since mr and mrs anderson just has a ring to it
She like 'why you act like that to me?
Then walk right back, mike jack to me?
Everytime we fall out I throw your ass out'
But you just end up boomeranging right back to me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I think you crazy, crazy
You need medication
You should calm down
You need meditation
Sending me a text with a hundred exclamations
About how I'm wrong without any explanation at a ll
Before you say another nigga next up
I should call the maid down cause I messed up
I gave you what you need
Even on those shopping sprees
I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it)
She said 'what if we reverse roles
And you was front row cheering at my first show
And a couple dollars later and some luis vuitton clothes
I could fuck a couple niggas thinkin that you said I know
And since I had no feelings for them then it shouldn't hurt yours
And since you thought id never do it, it even hurt more
And I would lie about it but you found out from a source
Whos word was more truthful than yours'

[Verse 4: Suai]
I'm so glad I didn't ever pin it
Now you ain't got nothing with your stupid name in it
And if I would've did it I probably would've stay with you
Listening to the lies you were constantly telling
You did me all wrong
What would even make me wanna write you a song
So glad I moved on
Cause now I gotta new guy that's turning me on
And the big ballad strings about to get played
Pretty melody I wrote about to get sang
A song about his love is gonna see the light of day
Why? cause you made it that way
Yea you made it that way

[Chorus]


[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, alright
Uhh,
Lowkey Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I'm the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame
I remember when you hated ooooh,
Now you tell me take my time,
How bout I just take your city make that motherfucker mine uh ha
I'm a underground king hoe
I sit tall I swing low
The game ain't always fair and that's the thing though
You can play your heart out everybody don't get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain't never answering
You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can't come in
Call me Ron Bergundy ya'll the other anchormen
What's on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I'm the new shit
And guess what it's true bitch

[Chorus:]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate us
They hate us
They hate us
They hate us

[Drake:]
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
It's so amazing
You woulda thought we made enough
[Big Sean:]
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ay look,
I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I'm just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team hand on my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nurse so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I'm the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I'm who they going ape shit over
I'm who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money's over all
I'm tryna move my momma from the ghetto's to the meadows
Well she can't stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I'm living everyday month yearly
Yell until you motherfuckers hear me
We made it

[Chorus]


[Chorus: Big Sean]
Yeah this was meant to be
I came in the world knowing nothing is for free
So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me
My life is the shit I guess that this was meant for me
[Repeated]

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.

Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
Tell a bitch to tell her friend
To tell her friend to tell a hoe
I have been the realest since the doc cut my umbilical
Hundred inch dick yep and twenty pound genitals
So you gon have to stay there til my secretary tell you enter hoe.

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Stack that paper
Stack it stack it stack it up some more
Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more
I'm smoking up on that tropical jolly green yeah Galapogos
Rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold
I'm who these girls is tryna know jumping off Jeronimo
They tell me I'm the best I say I ain't even trying hoe
See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes
So now I'm in two hoes, real shit boy
You don't drink, more for me
We chillin out when niggas can't afford to be
Look baby girl you better act accordingly
Cause I see bout ten more of you but sorry there's no more of me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can
Cause I might go from plane to whips
See my money is hand to hand
I'm shining from neck to wrist
And your girl want mouth to mouth
But I make her get neck to dick
Cause she just want connections with a nigga that's connected
Bitch, I'm who they want see want see
Used to tell me everything I won't be
You gon be, fucking with piranha's and they gon eat
But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry
Oooh, and now my life is beautiful
I'm a boss bitch you should come and grab a cubicle
Look and I remain until my funeral
Stand up nigga like I'm in front of the urinal
Boyyyyyyy

[Chorus: Big Sean]


[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I'm lit
So go on, light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life'd it!
I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin
They sayin sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael hoe
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool cause I got the title hoe
See I just want my fantasies and real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can't hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Chorus:]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love?
Or lose your girlfirend or groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set 'til you considered great?
How many missed calls 'til you considered fake?
How many dreams before 'til it's considered fate?
I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally.
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory"
I'm praying that he make, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories...

[Chorus]

Chiddy Bang
Big Sean

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
They say I'm too fake, fuck it I'm paid
I can't even find an empty spot inside my safe
I got cardis on my eyes, Louis on my case
Lobster, shrimp, and calimari right here chilling on my plate
They tell me I'm on time, even when I'm late
Even if it's a lie they say everything is great
I'm grabbin' the fattest asses, just to see 'em shake
I swear I'm too real to be, I'm too real to be livin' so fake

[Chorus: hockey sample]
Look out!
Cause I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain't shit
Known him for forever and he ain't on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling "You the mayne, Big"
He ain't no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit
Man I tell him suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it's oh Big was up
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin' actin' different huh?
No really I wasn't fuckin' with you from the beginnin' bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handle like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin' like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I'm too real, yeah, boy

[Chorus: hockey sample]
Look out!
Cause I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Fake it 'till you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I'm a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like I flip a pack
A year ago a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
Till' I hit the booth and came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin' so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, cause I'm not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jiggle with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don't respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I'm too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain't with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I'm in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implants
But I'm real

[Chorus: hockey sample]
Look out!
Cause I'm just too fake for the world
I know it's just a game to me
I'm just too fake you see
I wish I didn't have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It's breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don't like it but it's true


[Big Sean:]
Ok I say that shit again, I said it once before
I just, I just, I just, I just want it all
I glisten and shine with miss's fine model chick,
Big behind, bad enough to skip the line
But to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double o you can call me Mr Bond
Bitch I am a monster I belong on district 9
Catch me in my office, office, doin business
The fuck you doin? Bullshitttin
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran

Just a million people behind me and I don't have verizon
Man I'm chillin with my niggas nigga

When I'm done go ahead... what the fuck this is? !
What the fuck you doin? Bullshitttin

By the time ya'll over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time u ridin wat I'm ridin on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy

Somewhere chillin in Maui swimmin with the scuba fishes

[Big Sean:]
Yeah, you hear that?
That's inevitability
You can't stop this shit, I'm too tapped in
Too loyal

Surrounded by a few of my niggas who did breaking and entering
Through a bidness with them because they can't break a commitment
Look, I'm a magician, I belong inside Magic City
Got too much intuition to just blow tuition on titties, I know
Young Metro got that stick, that's a cig, he don't smoke
Fuck around, get smoked
I can't think of one time I was put up on the spot, then I choked (I can't)
I can't think of one time I got rich then went broke
(Metro Boomin' wants some more, nigga)

Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business
Ye said, "Kill em all"
God the only witness
I'm set, sunset
Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team)
Bitch, please do not interject
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat

I'm consistent, I'm persistent
Got to get it, bitch, I risk it
Time to hit them big licks and make that shit a tradition
Yeah, what goes around comes around, faster than fidgets
Man, outchea is frigid
Man, these streets is vicious
'Bout to get my girl some kids just to start a family business
'Cause it's all about business, yeah, be bitch ya business
Yeah, look, we out here tryna start a franchise
We tell the truth, you tellin' stories 'round the campfire
Yeah, it's all game ho, let it soak
Me and my bros rock the same chains around like we a cult
I'm the one in the bunch, they protect me like the Pope
Going all night on the daily though
Rolling down 7 mile, bet a thou'
Hit downtown then hit the Isle
Nothing free, not even style
Free Vezzo, yeah let him out
King of my city, man, feel like I'm Coretta child
I'm my mama's son, I gotta rise
I can't let her down

Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business
Ye said, "Kill em all"
God the only witness
I'm set, sunset
Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team)
Bitch, please do not interject
If you move too quick, I might take it as a threat

[2 Chainz:]
Got 'em waiting for my verses like it's Christmas to come
Would talk about my exes, but I'm dissing them all
Bought foreclosed houses, and I'm fixing them all
Any time I caught work, it was pistols involved
Yeah, I'm talking big business, here go the statistics
One out every five people trapping turn snitches
Get up out the game, put it up for a rainy
Hardest working man in showbiz, no complaining
Yeah, I get a rush from the grind
Touchdown, bust down, single for tonight
When she come over, deep tissue neck shoulder
Got a restaurant, a label when I closed her
Lying? I ain't lying
Lying down the street
Discount code, first come, gon' eat
And this ain't for the weak, I do it every week
I do it in my sleep, got in it like ink

[Big Sean:]
Bitch, I'm doing digits, all business, big bidness
See me on the block? Mhmm, bitches still business
See my dick off in her mouth? Yep, bitches still business
Ye said, "Kill em all"
God the only witness

Put it down for the team that I protect (for my team)
Bitch, please do not interject
If you move too quick, I may take it as a threat

Look, boy, the bidness internal, the vision's eternal
These niggas will burn you
Don't ask no questions if that shit don't concern you
I've been standing outside all day, man, rocking my thermal
My off-white came straight from Virgil
My brothers on side of me, that's who I turn to when shit gets too turnt to handle it
Dolo, it's too lit inferno
While you was dozing, I thought I was nocturnal
Every single success I had first in the journal
You bitches nothing but hurdles
Boy, I'll hop right over you
Who the fuck you think watching over you?
I'm God's favorite, you couldn't pray a hundred times a day
To have me over through
I'm the bipolar you
I'm doing what you way too ho to do
I got a ocean-view overview that reminded me this is overdue
Jeez, I don't got feelings, I just fill seats
I'm on fleek, I don't retreat
I did this shit in my sleep
Sike, I don't sleep, I don't cuddle
Bitch, I'm the team captain inside the huddle
The man of my house and the man your little brother grew up to (straight)
The man in my hood and all the other hats that I juggle (straight)
Niggas my little cuzzos, little niggas
Nobody sonning me
If am a sun, I'm the one you look up to
Fuck you
Big Bidness

Now foul lines, just front lines
Fuck taking shit, boy, I just take what's mine

[Big Sean:]
And I'm still hungry like a nigga was unsigned
Don't nobody want this shit more than I want mine
Fuck a free meal, boy, I'd rather go hunt mine
When you get the ball, boy, you be fumbling
When you talk that shit be mumbling
Man, I got my one shot
Fucked around and and-one'd it
If the dogs ain't there then they one call from it, look
Run you out your house and now your ass apartment hunting
From the Michigan cold, and I'm colder than that
Don't fuck with my crazy ass, boy
Your mama should've told you that
When we in it, one way out
This life just like a culdesac
The hood behind me like a cobra back
You quote the internet, I quote the facts
But snake niggas never tell the truth
You a liar
If you swear to God one more time on your life you might die

Real ones, I know you feel me
Independent women, I know you feel me
If you self-made me then you feel me
Text from my girl said "Come feel me up"
Real dawgs, I know you feel me

[Big Sean:]
Day after day seems like I push against the clouds
They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
Down on my luck and up against the wind

Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (no, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused (no)
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain, 'cause
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah

Bitch I ain't going to your event
You do too much going out and not enough going in
I got too much going on, so I'm gone with the wind (gone)
And if I ain't going to work, then I'm going to the gym (to the gym)
Yeah, bitch I'm at focus
Don't get it confused
I'm too spiritual to lose
It's worth every single bruise
Long as the dogs proud of me, then I got nothing else to prove
Long as Milly proud of me, then I got nothing else to prove
I'm a G, I'm a Don, I'm a soldier (I'm a soldier)
I'm charged up, man I'm beaming, I'm solar (pew)
I'm from the streets, full of heat, don't get boiled
They chew you up and spit you out, like it's spoiled
And my mind is an open mind
I believe in the Bible and Quran
And I follow the signs, yeah not street signs
I mean universal signs, I'm outside
And I realize my life got more meaning than a triple-entendre
And I realize any time, the perfect time

Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune
Don't get it confused, don't get it confused
We are not the same, boy I smile through the pain, 'cause
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, look

Don't nobody know me, like I know me (like I know me)
So I follow instincts only (only)
Man I done been double-crossed by my homies
I learn the hard way that they was authentic phonies (fake bitch)
Boy this shit so real in the field that I hardly stand still, but take care of my body still
I been drinking more water and popping less pills man
Unless they vitamins, 'cause nigga I'm tryna live
And God blessed me like I got bad allergies
So I'm working like I run off an eternal battery
And if I dress casual, no I'm not a casualty (no, no)
And if I put my mind to it then that's what it has to be
Yeah you're fucking right damn, sure bitch that's for certain (fucking right)
Never cut the family ties only cut the burdens (whoa)
Got so many cuts and scars it look like I left the surgeon
Done been through so much shit, I'm like a whole other person (thank God)

Don't get it confused, don't get it confused, yeah (no, no)
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah

I'm in tune, I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah yeah
I'm in tune, I'm in tune, yeah

I'm in space, I'm in mind, I'm in tune
On a mission 'til I get inside my tomb and cacoon
Every success is just a checkpoint, passing move
When I leave this body, I'ma prolly set up on the moon
Hold it down, I'm the glue
We be here, that I knew, since Timbaland and Magoo
And I proved and I bloomed
And I'm gon' win more than my room
Hand straight up like it's noon
If I can't live a hundred years, I'm gone way too soon
I'm in tune

[Future:]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you


Metro
We don' came up dog and never look down
I might gotta throw my Jesus chain on for this

When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still and had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya

Everything automatic so I can't waste time
And if we break up I only make up time
My team do this shit easier than lay-up lines
Never scared to cross that line or pay up fines
Look, Don Don Don that's my top 3 in the order
Never took a shortcut
Meet a Crip off the late back
Y'all look like a short club
Shoutout to my loyal ones, I wish that it was more of us
Went from 30, 000 a year to 30, 000 feet as my floor plan
I got El Chapo with a choppa as my doorman
I'm on the other side taking care of what's important
If business not boomin' then it's time to change the format
Time to change the recipe, I'm special especially
Going for the record, no felony
And I'm dodging jail and jealousy
Day dreaming about a cruise with Penelope
Looking like success fell on me
And get rid of all that jealousy
All that hate in your heart
I ain't got no enemies
I'm focused on what's meant for me
Putting my energy back into me, real shit

When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya

Boy this shit intricate
Working like a machine they keep trying to throw a wrench in it
But I'm too intuitive and into it
No ghost writing, no sixth sensing it
That's why all this shit sound so intimate
That's why I feel like you know me before we face to face
As for the latest I'm the greatest Ali Bomaye
I put that work in overnight like that shit due today
I paint the pictures they can't trace try and you get erased
I'm less focused on props and more on property
They put so much back on my hood that I changed the economy
I'm 'bout to build a movie deal to downtown properly
And help provide the heart of the city just keep on watching me
If these bitch ass niggas got they wish and stopping me
Just know I done done so much good business in my life
That there's gone always be a job for me, a op for me
I never burned bridges so there's a hundred ways to get where I gotta be

Same people you see on the way up
Same ones you gonna see on the way down
You feel me?
You love me, I love you
You hate me, I love you. Straight up

When you put the work in man it shows
Straight up out the ashes then I rose
I done hit a all time low
Been at a stand-still had to go go go
Man they out here on a scheme like la-la-la
Breaking promises you need like na na na
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya
No hearts, no loves no kumbaya

And when I'm gone you won't see me (gone)
Unless you give me a reason

V12, I got a need for speed
Only time I'm slowing down is in between her knees
Might tell her ass to leave when I need to breathe
Lil Metro on the beat, push the keys with ease
I flew out every airport, of course God is my source
When you do the numbers it gets taxing of course
Somehow I just kept it twenty-five times four
Kill the shows, kill the pussy, they both want an encore
Like go Don, go
Gave everybody 'round me jobs
Fuck a job corps, bitch we on the top floor
Working like we still tryna get it off the ground though
And if you not contributing bitch then fuck you 'round for?

[Big Sean:]
I think these boys don't like me, want to fight me
But they don't talk to my face like they do on IG
I guess it bring the best out of me when they doubt me (for sure)
Fucked up how my mind be, maybe the mayhem calm me
Bring competition 'round me, eat 'em alive like zombies
I think I got insomnia, up all night to the morning
Turn my phone off 'cause I got a higher calling
And for the gold metal I keep my foot on the pedal
Keep my girls on rose petals, keep runnin' into the devil
Beat his ass every time, next time I'ma bring a shovel
To put his ass in the dirt and then laugh 'til it hurt
And I'm in rare form like Jordan airborne
I'm here there and gone, lowkey it's baritone
She love my pheromones, I'm 'bout to take this trip
And I can hold your hand instead of this carry-on, gone

Surrounded by real killers and shit, doing it for the thrill of it
Graveyards on some Thriller shit, only zombies 'round here; fiends
They need help and they had dreams, but don't nobody give a shit

I mean, record-breaking shit, all we doing is taking risks
I ain't got time to take my time, I'm doin' it like my life on the line
I ain't have no lifeline in my whole lifetime, no hero to hide behind
With a soul like mine, when it go night time, there's no other choice but to shine
Look, no gold mines, set goals in my mind when the stars are aligned, I'm divine (straight)
So understand we gon' see success, that's inevitable (whoa)
You couldn't hold me down even if I was in federal (whoa)
You couldn't stop these plays even if I was ineligible
Kneeling like Colin Kaepernick if that shit unethical (Kap)
Yeah, free my mind, no bargain (free)
Got one girl, she the hardest (I swear)
That pussy supercharging, making love between war and
Then I hit the stage then get to talking like I'm Marcus Garvey (like I'm Marcus)

Shots fired, I need 'em right now!

Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, no, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gonna realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
That night you can't sleep
You gonna realize that this is bigger than me

Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and Mercedes keys
Got it and still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir:]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Starrah:]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring

God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special I'll feel it then
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah

[Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir:]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet

[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything.
[Big Sean:] That's deep to feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes.
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah.
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it So I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up with that, I might say, you know it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day. I mean you decide to live your life like that then pshh man I guarantee we'll live life to our best potential. It's that simple? It's all about living in the moment. Period.

Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time man
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though (Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything expect worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I'm on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I'm Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga I don't act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot "count to ten" me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain't too many seen both sides
Nigga fuck what you know
Nigga I'm takin' back control
The under dog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off

Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain't getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Kanye West & Big Sean:]
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bitch, bounce (Yeah)
Is you a real one?
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Is you a real one?
Real one
Real one
Don


(I am ready right now)
Uh huh
I look up, I don't even...
I think it's funny how it go down
I don't even know no more
Official shit

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

I'm the livin' proof that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece
People passin' faster than I'm passin' weed
My daddy tell me, "Stay strong, son and be the man you have to be
Holdin' shit down, don't crash at sea"
(Brrrr) Paper on my phone line
It's on my phone like fax for me, that's facts to me
But I don't want it if it can't change shit drastically, dramatically
'Cause actually, I realized time's the most valuable, actually
So I'm a call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'm a text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me
Don't ask for me, don't ask for me
Don't ask for me
Lot of shit been goin' on, things goin' wrong
So don't ask for me

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

She been mad, I've been on the go, on a roll
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
I quote unquote say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' that 520 like it's 420
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett, I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tucked in, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with
Who the bad bitches gon' fuck with and lames just don't fuck with
My stock's risin', I'm goin' public
If I write it, it's gon' publish
You're fuckin' with the best, no discussion

So disgusting
It's that 3 and a third shit
Straight up

I'm hangin' halfway off the balcony
Overthinkin' 'cause my job is way more than a salary
Everything around me gold like I just practiced alchemy
I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me
She been mad

[Man 1:] Yo, yo your mom callin' you
[Man 2:] Um, I'm a call her back
[Man 1:] You sure dawg? She keep callin'
[Man 2:] Yeah for sure, for sure, bruh, I'm a call her back


You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong (this one's for you, you, you)
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (you, you, you)

You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (no)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, "Don't worry 'bout it"
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy
Anything for the fam, how you raise me
I'm yo baby but you still my baby
Ayy


I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think Iâm ready to jump out the window

Know ya momma didn't raise you to take no disrespect, yeah
I feel, I feel like real queens know how to keep the game in check
You, you cried on my phone the whole night that time he crossed the line, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I was there
I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah

The question isn't "Do he love ya?"
The question is "Do ya love yourself?"
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess
Way back then we the best thing that never happened, but

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So if I think I'm ready to jump out the window

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation?
What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation,
You need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill.
Look

Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needing clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity
Hear me

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend though
We already wasted too much time
And your time is the only thing I wish was mine
So, yeah, I think I'm ready to jump out the window

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know

I don't mean to sound like the jealous type but you oughta know, oughta know
I think me and you should get together sometimes on the low, low, low
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth, I gotta know
Sometimes I wonder if you even know how much you worth I gotta know

I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know

I think I'm ready to jump out the window
And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend
This one's for you, you, you, you


Is it time?

Look, I spent my whole life tryna improvise
I'm not saying that shit for you to sympathize
Spent my whole life tryna find the light that's at the end of the tunnel
I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Got the whole city on fire
Boy, this the flow that got Steph Curry inspired
This the flow that got Lebron James finna rewire
This the flow that got my whole family finna retire
Flows on flows, I might drown in this bitch
Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slave master take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you 
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole

I take a plan and then I back to back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hmm.. not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out but I can count on my hands
Who I'mma talk to in this bitch
Girl's from law school in this bitch

Awe man

You hot for a minute, me

Hop in the booth, man that shit like a gym to me
Don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day

[Big Sean:]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, "Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too."
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (fuck 'em)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America; I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30, so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout
But they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins
Though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means, so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing, dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher powerâhow I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit, I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the GOAT while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Eminem:]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes, like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see before you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, "late" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back, like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round, like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch
I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A.
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating âem
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, "Wait!" pleading
But screaming is pointless, like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'maâ¦

[Big Sean:]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

(I know you feeling yourself right now.)
(But I'm not sure she's the oneâI wouldn't call her, man.)
"Hey, I'm outside."
What are you doing here?


All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
Forever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

Feel like you owe me checks
Owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply
I don't got no regrets, you disrespect
Disrespect only time I seen you now is on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to
You got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals
Now you back, it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do
They didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
'Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya
Damn

All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gonna take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
Forever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass
Honestly I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play no blame game
Pointing fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both on the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust
I don't wanna have a fake us

But all that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life
It's gon' take more than that to set it right, though
'Cause you so fucking outta line
Forever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

My friends say I should be over you
Getting hurt every time I'm close to you
I think me and you are overdue
I think this is what we supposed to do
'Cause you so fucking outta line
Forever letting them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
Taste what's mine
You so fucking outta line

Hit my phone if you need a whole pound aye

[Big Sean:]
I done made sacrifices, so many sacrificesÂ 
I done gave up so much free time knowing time ain't free
Fuck it I sacrificed it
My girl show me love, she know I made sacrifices
And if it's real real love then you make sacrifices
To get ahead man you gotta make sacrifices
Fuck it though that's how hungry my appetite is

I know my great, great, great aunty was a slave
I could only imagine all the sacrifice she made
I could only imagine all the shit she had to take
I'mma make sure all the blood she gave wasn't in vain
I sacrifice for your entertainment boy
I'm Mr. Anderson in the Matrix
Check the last name it's all facts
And the human race is all about pacing
Look at all the ones I outlasted
I'm the one at the end like I count backwards
Never satisfied details classified
Till the afterlife make a sacrifice, Don

[Quavo:]
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice
Why can't y'all recognize that we all came from sacrifice


[Twenty88:]
Every time you call you know I'm gonna come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya
Every time you call, you know I'm gonna come get ya
You know I'ma come get you
Every time I'ma come with ya

At the same time
Put you on a ride of your life
And meet you there at the same time
Same place, same time
Every time you call
At the same time, same place, same mind
At the same time, same place, same mind

[Big Sean:]
Who overdue for a night off
Left the crib, I get you right off
How soon is too soon?
I see you every full moon, blue moon
We never did the relationship, it gets too messy
But if we keep messing with the wrong people
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it
You remember when you came to Sweden
I came too and we treated the hotel room
Like the garden of Eden
Chill, I won't tell all your secrets

[Twenty88:]
Look, we in tune, we in sync
Eye to eye, don't need to blink
We been here, don't need a drink
I bring my A-game
And put you right  where you need to be
Look I fuck you, touch you, tease you
Have you learning things about you
No one could teach you
I see in you, see in me
Tell me what you see in me

[JhenÃ© Aiko:]
Every time you call...


Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack, yeah

This the feeling though that I'm missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday
With Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Tim's, in the Lamb
Mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan
Bucket hat like Gilligan, yeah
Lately I've been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see that lysol dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it is you always act like you knew
You told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me how of we always used to dress up as a family
And go to Sunday service, and being in church, singin'
Ain't been to church in awhile
But it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building
It's about how you praisin' him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
'Til my all time low and something throw me a jetpack
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone
Or any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet
Who was jealous of me and JhenÃ©
Who you would always advise with me being away
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of you until I see you there myself

Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack

And mama said hit them with the inspiration
In times like these we need inspiration
Turn all your problems into inspiration
Elevation, inspiration
I said elevation, inspiration
I said elevation, inspiration

Thank you God for all my set backs
'Cause he the reason I'm able to give back
This feels like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, whoa


Voices in my head sayin' I could do better
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind (damn)
Voices in my head saying I could do better
You always do the same shit

This was supposed to be the last time
Last hit, last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh
This was supposed to be the last one
Last two, last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me about
'Til I wore 'em out (shit)

Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still (fuck)

Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Stick to the plan
Stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan
Stay focused, don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else, you know this
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking frontin and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracting
Put that into what's worth having (boy)
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, to the plan stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the plan, stay focused
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me

I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, No you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know the effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan
Still we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head
Voices in my head


[Chorus:]
Got goals, got dreams, I'm infatuated with nice things.
I love money, it might seem.
This is my desire want and need.

[Verse 1:]
All I do is eat shit and think about success.
Cause man, I done have enough stress.
But I beat every obstacle they put up.
I'm back against the wall like a stove so I cook up.
I've always been the best at every single thing I took up.
So I feel extra bad for the challenges they hooked up.
(D-Town)Come and make a visit to the (West Side) if I need to be specific.
If I ever up in court best believe I plead the fifth and they headed to the club bartender bring a 50.
These niggas bitches swear to god the p-to-missing.
I'm just chillin with my family, Mr. Peter Griffin.
And my girl look better than yours.
And I'm the only thing lookin better than her.
Yeah, and I'm just tryin to make a million off recordin.
Psychic read my fortune, said Id be worth a fortune.

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
I learned at a young age you gotta grind for it.
We been waitin all day n night for it.
It seems like weve been waiting all our life for it.
Some niggas'll take a life for it.
But I'm a say it I did it all legitamate then put my niggas on it just to say I was considerate.
Race to success and I'm like where the competition went?
The musics runnin bitch and it never tore a ligament.
Niggas comin up to me like Sean I beg your pardon.
B-I-G, but how much is you chargin?
Runnin up to me for they buzz like a barber.
And all that weak shit just make mine sound harder.
And I'm a live this life till I'm gone.
Only people that could give you life is a judge and God.
But the only one that judge me is my God.
So I'm a live life like fuck what you thought.

[Chorus x2]

This is what I live for.
This is what I die for.
This is what I stayed up every single night for.
This is what I waited my whole life for.
This is what I waited my whole life for.
This is what I live for.
This is what I die for.
This is what I stayed up every single night for.
This is what I waited my whole life for.
This is what I waited my whole life for.

[Chorus x2]


[Chorus: Keely]
I feel good
I feel wonderful
And it's because
You made it that way
I feel supa spectacular because of you

Now I'm flying
I think I'm floating
I feel so high
Your love leads me to the sky
And if I fall I won't care
Cause I'm safe with you

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Big Sean:]
Now baby your the truth so I'm just being honest
You treat me like a king so that's why your my highness
That means queen
Seems I known you for the longest
Funny how we connected on the low like Vonage (huh)
And I know it ain't as deep as it could be
Or as it would be but that's how it should be
Cause overtime we gonna be fine like wine
I never put another ova mine
See difference between you and them is they just wanna shine and
Well you
You just want Sean
So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family
That when I get that grammy, they gon' be a granny
And if I see that reaper b4 you see that reaper
Just know I love you every time you hear me thru them speakers and I'ant tryna blow your head up like reefa but we got chemistry to the point we need a
Beaker.

[Keely:]
So promise that you'll keep me
Promise you won't lead astray
Promise me forever promise me to stay
So I keep you with my laughter
Feel sooo complete

Something bout your brown eyes that gets me lost for days
Your touch is like an angel lookin out with heavens grace
And that's why I'll keep you shelter from the storm
I-I-I
I need you here with me

Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Big Sean:]
Now listen
First off if it was the last thing
I'll put you first
So you deserve my last name
You make my worst days feel like my birthday
If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way
Like not seeing the world trade your worth the galaxy baby so let's world trade
And I tend to tell God thank you
Cause baby your my angel
At least from my angle

[Keely:]
Cause I'm in love (with your) story
Need I'm in love with your smell and your smile
So keep on liftin' (lalala) I won't stand in your way
Cause I'm in love with you

[Faddes:]

[Verse:]
I got suspended, ohhhhh you got suspended
For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14, 400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ohhhhh give me my tennis
Shoes
Give me a minute, ohhhhh I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him
Back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Hessleton
With' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10Day Pestilence
So far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon
Ohhhhh you got suspended, ohhhhh you not gon' finish
Ohhhhh you look familiar, ohhhhh you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it, ohhhhh you representin'
A class of bad kids, 14, 400 minutes ahhhhh! Like

Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh! Igh!


I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often have dreams of being locked in my mamas Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot
I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 Days off
That's an awful lot
I was off campus, but the officer
Told the office, that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave
While rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught, picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups, why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah? Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends, the next coffin is there's
Guess what bitch, I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops, to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking, like I'm all full of fear... alright, I'm tweaking


[Hook:]
I burned too many Brain Cells down
To be worried bout my Brain Cells Now [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Here's a tab of acid for your ear
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I'm the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non kamasutral
You niggas goofies since a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I'm a neutral
But I'm a let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur
Verse is a metaphor
A metamorphoses and I'm a fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand's son"
Breaking Walls like Samson
But I'm a throw a tantrum
'Til I'm on Every Samsung
Sanyo, and Handheld and Handgun
Please Put ya lighter's up
'Til life is up
And light it up
And slice a cut
The night is young
It's nice enough
The nicest blunt
The nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on
Hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4's for 15, yea my niggas we be taxing a lot
Only to goofies tho, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled
Remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrrang Dang to Lil' B
And Bang a Rang to Peter Pan

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Light a joint
Or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga
If you ask me
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don't answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It's a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce
Nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and
Feminine's getting intimate
All broads is frivolous
Homies could get they dividends
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic son of a biscuit
Man fuck this shit

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, hope the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
Till my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling
Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding getting nice cause it's nice out

[Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferrarro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game operation with Parkinsons
Young kid rappers, kidnappers
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, Come Kit-Kat you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sulaiman]
Now the team work make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'm a bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, All she do is make it clap

[Hook x4]


10 Days?
Are you for real?
Are you serious?
Fuck it then!

Fuck you tahm bout?...
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...

Nigga, fuck this whole school and everything you tahm 'bout
Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch I fucking signed out
Bitch I've been suspended, bitch I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start or when it end, or who gone come out
Or if I walked the stage, I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out
My book out, my pick out, my hair, my fucking big mouth
You dick head you dipped out of class and now you shit out
Of luck who fucking slick now, and with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mix down with a diss track
From Ms. Rownd and my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face and my principal that fist pound
And now you gotta switch gowns, caught you, little rascal
We got you throwing tantrums, when you could've thrown a tassel

Fuck you tahm bout?...
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...

Nigga you're a weakling, why you talking dealing?
Like, "All my niggas flip birds!" Nigga, you're a wing-zing
You ain't nothing but my seedling, I'll hang you from the ceiling
And leave yo' little ass leaking, and leave yo' body stinking
Dude yo' ass been drinking? Or you just wasn't thinking?
I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!
I hear you're pockets jingling, it's calling me like ring, ring!
I'll choke you with your bling bling, then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though, like, "Why he such a asshole?"
And I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme nigga, I'm fucked up out my mind nigga
I stay right off the '9 nigga, that's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up, harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up, stay talking but donât send it up
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash, that ben what up
Pockets keep that denim bruh like

Fuck you tahm bout?...
Nigga, fuck you tahm bout?...


[Intro:]
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma

[Verse 1:]
I said 'Hey Ma', don't go stretching your wallet
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on get ya nails polished, stylist for your eyelids
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island
Ms. Brown and Ms. Polleck, little boy done grown up
Little voice done blown up, middle-class that bonus
Hey Ma, Hey Mama Jan; God just gave me another chance
Rod just gave me another line, probably gave me another fan
7-7-3, Oh, since Kanye was a three-old
Down the street from D. Rose, was practicing his free-throws
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro
Shout out that Ms. Moody, auntie Toni them my heroes

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 2:]
Hey Ma, hey Ma I know I never did behave a lot
Never got good grades a lot
And turned your hairs to grays a lot
And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped but saved a lot
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot
They playing with your checks, your shit

Save Money, my partner and them
I'm part of them, It's part of me

So she just gonna throw her steps on

She giving a show, now watch her break it

[Verse 1:]
Back it up like, "Juke Juke"

Hands on the tracks like Choo Choo
Can't nobody do it like you do
True, true
Mami sip a little bit of the screw juice
Or a little bit of that special k
And throw it in the bowl like fruit loops
Hola, mami chola
Mami hol'up, mami slow up
'Scuse my french, my lingo
But I no hable cinco
Her girlfriends say they bout it, you know that I'm bilingual
And Chano gonna mingle, I'm off a couple pintos

So while they out her frontin' go on back it for your mans

And I'm that dude, you heard bout him
And I hope that get your shirt off and if not
Keep on dancin' babe, all I need is that preview
Put you on the floor and show them niggas how to freak you
Slow whine, slow grind
On time, you can take your own time
But if I can't hit your ass on time
Gotta hit me online, you can't hit my phone line

[Breakdown]

[Hook]

[Breakdown]


I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt ya hand on my head yelling "call his father"
But people don't hear ghosts
So how they gon' blame me
Money saved me
So I'm a do the same thing
You droppin pounds, gettin small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this
Over dose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close
With a boatload of dope quotes within it

Dropping tapes 'til I losted count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight
Like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling I'm Boston bound
Bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I'm falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around


[Verse 1:]

Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time long time now
Since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile

[Verse 2:]
Dropping tapes 'till I losted count
Coughing out blood, dropping weight like I lost an ounce

Long time long time now since I seen your smile
We miss you

[Verse 3:]
#10Day
It's been a really, really long time, long time
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me and lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit, just as long as you inkin shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that?
Young ass nigga where you headed?
Long time to get famous, life's whatever you make it
Just thank God that we made it


[Intro / Outro:]
In the real world, we just people with ideas

[Verse 1:]
That shit cray that shit dead
That shit fake blast a kid
Cassius clay at his head
At a boy, at a kid
I'm a need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need a Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups when niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands that's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
Niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking what up, I said on my soul I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy told me to hate 'em my mamma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels my niggas told me it's nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
Going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I call him my lil homie he bought him a 45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they mamas and all of they mamas miss em'
And this shit is just stupid this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

[Hook:]
(I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you) [3x]

And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you

(I'm missing you) [5x]


[Intro]

[Verse 1:]
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybel I'm a find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom

[Hook:]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smiles come through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 2:]
Let's take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch
That get off like wristslaps

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connies Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like "Lord, let me see another year like this"

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class Switcher, Time Bender
Chance Bennett a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair
Fun fact, I'm never going back to school
Been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

[Hook: x2]
And it's alright
And it's ok
And we're all good
We're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 2:]
Uh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo and snap a couple candid's of the family
Get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
Cause honestly I've always loved the way you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

[Hook]

[Outro:]
So good, So right
Hey baby, so good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight


[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Stupid ass student
True I got truants in Spanish
Beats by Inglish rap chanish
Fluent, can't fly got flew in I'm foolin'
Adidas influence Nike I do's it
Coolin' with Mikey, lowkey I rock
Mags on my bike, Tay like he chuck
Hockey I puck
Rockie I fresh
Saki, my cup like Rocky "Wassup"
Ohh he got two weeks ten with the foolie
Doobie sawbuck
School be too huff
Caleb my nigga, Fresco my nigga
Gon head send it up
SaveMula too tough

[Hook: x4]
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Wavy so wavy
Trendin' I'm trendy
Bending these pennies mommy done gave me
Business so savvy
Savey no spendy
Drifty so empty
City so windy
Master champ Chancelor, TrapMan the Chance or
Vance the bag handler, Bagger Vance
Pants is baggy, Vans rancid
Band of bad bandits
Abandoned bandanas banned from band practice
Sentence so gavel
Wordplay so scrabble
Chance to split atoms slit Adams apples
Adamant chano rat a tat vandals
Had to have at em' as an example

[Hook: x4]
This ain't no game, ain't shit here funny
You got me fucked up fucking with my money


[Verse 1: Chance]
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach when you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo, throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave
Shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if a I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seeing summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seeing summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Get my nigga back!"

[Hook:]
And I just want roll, with my windows down
And I just want roll, with my windows down

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a million
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real [?] nigga mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke
Drink 'til we fall out, fuck is you tahm boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance]
This is for sand in my shoes
Shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides
Shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us
You Helen Keller
But I'm a save my dollars for Mary Jane
And embellish her
Inhalin' her, Smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Elegar
But that's my nigga, my dude be droppin' hella verses
Shouts to D O C and new drive too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But I still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on


Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young; just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams

Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
High school, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro:]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away


This is my last shh- my last shit
Uhh, it definitely be mad important
Ey man, that sound like a Prince song

[Hook:]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

[Verse 1:]
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died- yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ainât tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

[Hook:]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha, shut your mouth

[Bridge:]
This part right here, right now
Right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit
I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit (IGH)

[Verse 2:]
Why toss my filter when she saved my life?
The same shit that kills us, always taste so right
That's why I pray to the dear lord
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh oh oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night
In the sky I get higher, higher

[Hook:]
Still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping

This part right here, right now

[Chance The Rapper:]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alky. Keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outtie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Vic Mensa:]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well
Go figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell
All praise to the God, God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me, take me to the bedroom, let you know me well
I mean normally, you see, Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high, burn trees, smoke Chlorophyll
'Til they can't feel shit, shit faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill
Miseducated, my dick delegated, rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass

I think we all addicted,
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we addicted

[Chance The Rapper:]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Twista:]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter
Two seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing out by trucks in a Uzi
That's the new principle, sometimes I'm a be about some ho
Sometimes I'm a wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'm a end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking

[Chance The Rapper:]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I think we all addicted

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses


[Verse 1:]
What's good good?
And what's good evil?
And what's good gangstas?
And what's good people?
And whys God's phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of em
I slurped too many pain-kills, downing em off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya'know I mean?
I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back cause the cops shot you
Buck buck bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News!"
Booyaka buckle up, mothafuck ops too
Ain't no knuckling up em young cause it just not cool

[Bridge:]
Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
Cause they help me beat my demons ass

[Hook: Chance & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing
That's right
[x3]

[Verse 2:]
Right? IGH
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against we tryna get lucky
Doper than Nucky
You're ending happy that's only a tuggy
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless IGH

[Hook: Chance & BJ the Chicago Kid]


[Skit:]
[Ken:] Well I should have you hooked up next week.
[Chance:] It's all good or whatever, I can wait 'til my birthday. I uh-
[Ken:] No, no, no, no. I told ya, I know you need it now, so next week I promise you I'll have you hooked up, ok?
[Chance:] Oh, alright. I just wanted to say thank you for everything. For the computer, the T-Shirts, and all the other stuff.
[Ken:] You know, Chance. Let me tell you something. You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done. Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, ok?
[Chance:] Thank you, love you.
[Ken:] Alright, son. Love you too, take care.
[Chance:] Bye bye.
Thanks for coming guys

[Verse:]
'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos,
And some fruit snacks, And some killa
Phone numbers on speed dial call em save monkey gorillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes,
I ain't really that bad at leaving,
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew it was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla,
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin
With bad bitches, put them aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even tuesdays wednesdays thursdays weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events,
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta,
And it feel good for me to thank you,
Put money back in your bank account,
Off of songs I barely could think up,
Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up,
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound,
I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo,
Thanks Justin lendin them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Nanana hey hey,, good intro,
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller,
Remember the first time we heard this dude and thought damn that's that nigga,
Everything's good.


[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

[Hook:]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
Young Rascal Flatts - young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like:

[Hook:]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words

All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam

This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam

[Verse 3 - Childish Gambino:]
Niggas please be focused - that 'Bino, you know this
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit, you know your 'hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said: "this my favorite song"
"Hold my purse" - now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car cause it's got cursing in it
Your boy like: "I'm the one who showed you," he want his percentage
Cause you were like: "this ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step - white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too

[Hook:]
This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words
But I still fuck with you, you just ain't never heard
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bounce that back
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam
This my jam, this my jam, this my jam, this my jam
I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm 'bout that jam, I'm bout that jam


[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Even better than I was the last time baby... Oh oh oh oh ooh
Yo we back
I'm good, so good
And we back and we back

[Verse 1:]
Raps just make me anxious and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'm a make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben A Baller, Benford, Butler's, Chauffeur's, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds zan, gotta lean
Make a joke bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking business
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Work, work, work, work, bang nigga, bang
Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, Deng, pick a lane
Flip a bird; pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn't be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some "x" on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancellor The Rapper, please say "The Rapper"
Magical word (poof), please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays; Green Bay to Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk till dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album and ain't even fucking done

[Hook]


Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is balling it up
What's better than followers is actually falling in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin in mud,
Rolling in green pastures, wandering following love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing your Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollering love
What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes, dollars, and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for calling her up
There ain't nothing better than falling in love

I've seen it come back, back, back and forth,
You hit the nail right on top of the head,
I know you seen it all before,
But when it looked you in the eyes it ain't nothing you could say but that's love
That's love
That's looove ooohh
That's love
Say that's love,
That's loooove, that's love, that's love that's love
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
That's looove
That's loooooooovee, that's loooove
Say that's love, that's looove, that's love
That's love, that's love that's love


[Intro/Bridge: singing]
Thirsty, thirsty, trynna choose
I mean I know, I'm pretty cool
My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice

[Verse 1:]
CHANO, Chathams own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer - suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer, held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroGods
City on the Come Up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin' Buenos Noches!
Wonder if I wrote this cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian Accent Husky
Acid addict, Costly avid Actor
Kevin Costner

AHHHHHHHHH! TURN UP TURN UP!

[Hook:]
Juice! (Juice!)

[Verse 2:]
God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hash tag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, igh!
But I love y'all souls
Don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop
Til you feel good enough to pop the popped bitch in the blue hills yop!
That one - drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get "fountain-of-youth"ed nigga
Stop with all the trynna introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude you the new nigga!
Hows it feel to be you, yo no se
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pops smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin pop smash
Hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe
Been paid, 10Day been they FAFSA

AHHHHHHHHH! TURN UP TURN UP!

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Yup, JUUUUUUUGO
You never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself trynna chase the paper
I just faced a Vega
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay up
Till you realize everybody in the world fuckin hates the Lakers, Hahaha
And then everybody wanna sip, til the juice spill everybody want a bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst just the worst it's the curse of the juice

[Hook]

[Bridge]

JUICE, JUICE, JUICE, JUICE. YUP.
JUICE, JUICE, JUICE, JUICE. YUP.

Yup.

Yup.

... Yup.


[Hook:]
My druggy
Love me
When I'm ugly
Hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy
I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 1:]
Damn I'm in so deep
Probably cause you're empty
You can't even speak
Damn your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh oh oh ohh
You been scratchin, you been fiendin
I'm a fix you, I'm a fuck you
I'm a get rid of them demons
It's my

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Damn I need a minute... aight lehgo
She fell in love, it fell apart... aight let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah me mad petty, Yeah me bogus
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah me know
Yeah she knew too, it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like fuck it
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Noname Gypsy]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the Silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "pill pop, baby girl cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek"
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Hook]

Let's get lost
Igh!


[Chance the Rapper:]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh!)

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless, trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music, swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG!)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended, last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley, always in the hallway
So I never been classy (Ha ha ha)
Shut up

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)

Acid, Acid, get it? Acid, melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper if this was work, I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped, like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split, look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back, give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit, batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit

Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)

[Action Bronson:]
Introducin', it's Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh, I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer
(Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain't no fumblin', in fact, I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot, then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag (baaaaag)
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
'87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef's salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn't help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me


[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, always
Still gotta letterman, no practice
Still gotta burner man, no lacking
Still outtin Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land, where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill,
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it Nitty the the old me
So I'm a tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Hook 1:]
I got that Mmm Mmm
I got that God damn
I'm yo pusha man
I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man
Pimp slapping, toe taggin
I'm just tryna fight the man
I'm yo pusha man
I'm yo, I'm yo pusha man [x2]

[Verse 2:]
You a laaaaaaaame, and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a Redeye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a Molly
Said "come to papa", she said "papa, yes"

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2:]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes, and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lotta niggas dying, so my 9 with the shits [x2]

[Verse 3:]
Move to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's rollie, and call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain save the hood, hood savior, baby boy, still get ID'd for swishers
Mama still wash my clothes, still with Save Money militia
I'm a still watch my bros
Trapped in the middle of the map, with a little bitty rock
And a little bit of rap
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac
And like literally jack

[Hook 2]

[Verse 4:]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fucking hurricane here
They be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position,
Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching

[Hook 2]

[Breakdown:]
I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.
I know you scared, me too.
I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.
If you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.

[Verse 5:]
It just got warm out, this this shit I've been warned about.
I hope that it storm in the morning, I hope that it's pouring out.
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks.
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dying first.
Cause everybody dies in the summer.
Wanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring.
I heard everybody's dying in the summer, so pray to God for a little more spring.

I know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.
If you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.


[Intro: x2]
Acid Rap!
I don't even talk to them on the phone again
Leave in the AM, on the road again
So bitch, let's fuck so I can smoke again
I gotta smoke again, I got shit to do

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Who smokin in my car?
It's that nigga Chano
AKA Mr. Bennett
AK Tony Montano
I've got some folks in low end
I got some folks in c-note
AK hundred dinero
You ever seen Casino?
I just got back with 'Bino
I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino
That's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with Cheese
And a kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her
Cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt
That's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam
That's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum
That's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square
That's a fuckin' rhombus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Who's sneaking in the club?
That's that youngster rapper
Un-saran wrap the purple
Wrap that blunt under after
Smoke all out the window
Cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter
You just might be the lick
Flame on, flame on
I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps
But better when I sing songs
No Drake, but I get my Trey on
Killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon
Savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron
Dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change
And I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch
Drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face
That's a work of art

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho ho twerk somethin'
Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so deaf, I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name herb, take herb, smoke herb (say word?)
How 'bout you? No dap, but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Let me put my mouth where you potty, boo
(IGH!)
Them niggas pissed, need potty training
They movement shit, that's a potty train
She ain't left yet, but she probably came
We kicked it then I score, soccer game
She was a phony goalie
I got great aim though, don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me
My name Solo cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie
Then we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper

[Hook]


[Intro - Ha Ha Davis:]
Come on, big fella, you drunk, big fella
Two sips and now you wanna trip, big fella
You not a drinker, I can see it all in your leg, big fella
You wobbly, big fella, you finna fall
Sit down, you drunk, big fella

[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]
All night, I been drinking all night

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
(You just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna, you just wanna)
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho

[Chorus - Knox Fortune:]
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay


[Intro - Chance The Rapper:]
And we back
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back, and we
And we back, and we back, na, na, na

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like AndrÃ©
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancÃ©e
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie YoncÃ©
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh, igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third

[Hook - Kanye West:]
This is all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
This is all we got
Music all we got, got, got
So we might as well give it all we got

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day

[Hook - Kanye West:]
Music all we got
Music all we got
Isn't this all we got?
So we might as well give it all we got
Music all we got
Music all we got

[Outro - Kanye West & Chicago Children's Choir:]
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
We know, we know we got it
Music
Music is all we got


Angels, na, na, na, na

I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't going to hell or the Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
So they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even have Steve giving out apples for free

[Hook - Saba:]
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gonna make me take the campers way downtown
You gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Hook - Saba (& Chance The Rapper):]
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na)

All of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels

[Hook - Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper:]
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
I don't make songs for free I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus black life ain't matter, I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps, gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Hook - Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper:]
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
Don't be mad
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up
Good God
The blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like...
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
Good God

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visit in heaven
I know the difference between blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant and her becoming my everything
War with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forced you to forfeit it, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh!

[Bridge - Byron Cage:]
There are obstacles in life
Many many trials and tribulations that come up
But you got to realize and know
That even Jericho walls must fall
Every wall must fall

[Hook - Jamila Woods & Byron Cage:]
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
I'm gon' praise him, praise him till I'm gone
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
(Are you ready for your miracle?)

[Outro - Chance The Rapper:]
Blessings keep falling in my lap


[Verse:]
I speak of promise land
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-farsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

[Hook:]
I made it through, made it through, made it through
And everything I gave to you, I gave to you, I gave to you
You got it, you got it, you got it, it's coming, coming, coming
So are you ready?

[Outro - with harmonization (HaHa Davis):]
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
Are you ready for your blessings?
Are you ready for your miracle?
(You ready big fella?)


[Verse - D.R.A.M. & [?]:]

Everyone is special
This I know is true
When I look at you

[Chance The Rapper:]
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter. I was acting a fool
But who would think their raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head. I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body
Can't rely on myself
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name
and starting missing my chance
LA for four months end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city bitch
I sleep in my hat
I felt hog-tied
ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there, he just siting there waiting
I'll be racing up the stairs. I'mma get to the gate singing

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

[T-Pain:]
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Oh, I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine

[Chance The Rapper:]
Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after "2 Legit"
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit
I "Stand Up" like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much they think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said why we in a queen bed
I said, "It's yours. Don't worry, little bean head.
I'm just here to catch my breath. I got a world tattoo."
She said, "Cool. Just bring me some food."

[T-Pain:]
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine
All my days I prayed and prayed and now I see the finish line
I'm gonna finish mine

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

[Drown]

The water may be deeper than it's ever been

[Noname:]
Lord, rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers
So when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So he can watch her lonely child
I know my God
I know my God seen his breaks and his edges
A jacket for giving that painted his city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days he prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love
And all that was left was his love

Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

[Kirk Franklin:]
Never, never, never
Chance, let me in
This thirst in my soulâ
There's a thirst in my soul and tell me
Where else can I go?
Where but you? Come on
I may cry a river
I may cry a thousand tears
But you take each drop and you washâ
You wash me new, me new
People sing this water is deep, yes, yes
And I need you toâ
Jesus, rescue me
Come on, save me
I need you to take me to your mountain, hallelujah
So someday Chicago will be free
Someday we'll all be free, be free

The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown


[Intro - My Cousin Nicole:]
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
And my heart will sing how great is our God
How great is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see how great is our God
How great, is our God
Sing with me, how great is our God
All will see, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, how great, is our God

[Intro skit:]
The first, is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit it Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis
The book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
Till one score in three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrified the enemy like Hedwig till he petrefied
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide
79th, 79th, I don't believe in science
I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I see dollar signs
Color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosena Santa invoked and woke up slaves from south Hampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's is behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Here, for I will speak noble things as they trusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, Exalt, glorify
Descend upon the earth with swords and fortify the borders where your shoulders lies
I used to hide from God
Ducked down in the slums like "shhh"

[Verse 2 - Jay Electronica:]
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat, hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark, gently, gently, I rowed my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud couldn't even let my light shine
But she was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height, wage won
The poltergeist to exalt the Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal of tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali will swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
'O son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with the foot on water and the foot on land
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber and put the true name of the Lord in it
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Cuff lights these beats with a ball of fire
Poison the scripture and gave us the pictures of false messiahs
It was all a lie
Mystery babylon, tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground


[Chance The Rapper:]
We used to roll at the rink
We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

[Towkio:]
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you cause

[Justin Bieber:]
We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

[Chance The Rapper:]
We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

[Justin Bieber:]
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

[Towkio:]
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you cause

[Justin Bieber:]
We've got so much history baby (juke)

When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say

Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop

[Verse 3 - Lil Yachty:]
Am I the only one who really care about cover art
Growing up I ain't have my brother cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After one night the folks thought I was finished
I pin my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh, bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted, didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as it cater
Oh, they fuck with me cause I'm different
New sound, new appearance
Bitches both from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out, my hand on my dick, I'm the shit

[Hook - Chance the Rapper and Young Thug:]
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I said am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes

I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezus said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht, no pies there
Aye, aye, captain
I'm high, captain
I'm so high
Me and God dappin'
This is my blessin'
This is my passion
School of hard knocks
I took night classes

[Chance The Rapper:]
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Pull up, they be like, "There he go!"

[Lil Wayne:]
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits, they be on steroids
Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they've been with toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, told you
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck a watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

[Chance The Rapper:]
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Just another day, had to pick up all the mail
There go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, "There he go!"

[Lil Wayne & Chance The Rapper:]
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
You don't want no problems, want no problems with me
Say so, got problems, say so
They be like, "There he go! "


We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane):]
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (we don't) do the same drugs no more (do the same drugs no more)
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Chance The Rapper + (Eryn Allen Kane):]
(Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics)
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
(It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
(Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't....)
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line

...n' a bowl
We just be smoking
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a bowl
We just be smoking a, we just
Fuck is going on? When did we buy a bowl?

We just be smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
There don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her...

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down ooh
She said, "let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down ooh
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoked to Fetty's song Zoo-Wap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I shoulda knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break

[Future:]
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding your back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down oh
I got to lay back the roof
I got to break the new rules
She can't be taking no cost
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me my mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give a perc full of steam
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and geuss
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can...

[Chance The Rapper & Future:]
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down ooh
Let me make this blunt
Make you dinner or somethin'
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve
A smoke break


[Intro:]
Oh, oh, oh, incredible
I would... incredible
Everything...

[Verse 1 - Chance The Rapper:]
Socks on concrete, jolly rancher kids
I was talking back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank top, nappy headed bike-stealing Chatham boys
None of my nigga's ain't had no dad
None of my nigga's ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We still catching lightening bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shawty's act hard
Okay now Dave grandpa grand crossing
First day, nigga's shooting
Summer school get to losing students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summer time don't got no time no more

[Hook - Chance The Rapper & (Francis & The Lights):]
(You're my friend)
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay around
Summer friends, summer friends
Summer friends don't stay
Summer friends don't stay, hey
Stay around

[Verse 2 - Chance The Rapper:]
Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Momma had salon doing perms out the armchair
Yeah we're working late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns for my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh!
Now I'm the same way, over time all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessing, now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
79, 79, 79, 79 place
79, 79, 79, 79 place
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the clerk
Cause if it ain't work, can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends
All my friends, all my...

[Chorus - Chance The Rapper & (Francis & The Lights):]
Stick around
Summer friends, summer...
(You're my friend...)
Summer friends don't stick around
Stick around
(And some of us...)
79, 79, 79, 79, hey
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, hey, hey
(You're my friend)
79, 79, 79, 79, hey, 79
(So put your head on my shoulder)
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide, hey
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide
City wide, city wide, city wide...
(I will wait around for you)
(I will wait around for you)
(So lay your head...)

[Interlude:]
May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful, grant you favor
And bring you back safely, I love you

[Outro - Jeremih:]
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when the changing nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends, my friends up

One day, I was tryin to be myself
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard"
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, it's hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for you hard niggaz to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she say I ain't have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

[Dug Infinite] It's just one two many niggaz got cars and no land

Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggaz know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggaz but readin be makin me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
I'm number one

[Dug Infinite] One two many niggaz tryin to tell me bout they theory

Durin divine hours, I use mind power to refine
flour/flower girls, and make em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Made signs built in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin head to backstreet leaners

[Erykah Badu (Common)]

[Common]
Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryin to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Lock'd in this Grid like a Tupac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts
to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(come on bay-bayyy) Bust it

[Erykah Badu]

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year
of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
like a destruction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's +Time to Kill+
In perseverence I'ma find a meal, and provoke
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat
It go..

Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein street
on the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggaz in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin myself and double checkin, I popped the Resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggaz with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?

[Erykah Badu]
Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong, oahhhhohhh (keep goin)

[Common:]
What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Check it, yo
You say a one for the trouble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh
(I can feel the funk) [x4]
Check it

I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream "fuck the world" for having a baby girl sorta cock block
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim say but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now

[Chorus:]
Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
What you wanna do girl(wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)
Yo, check it

Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now

[Chorus:]

I can feel the funk [x8]
Yo, check it, check it

I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass

[Chorus:]
[scratching]
I can feel the funk [x16] (makes me wanna shout, wanna shout) [x4]
[scratching] Wanna shout


[Common:]
After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to
you
You start thinkin about stuff...tryin to make the right moves
So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it
Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Bein my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brotha, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doin right and got you this far
Whether you say "in Jesus name" or Hum do Allah
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get it baby
Chorus Cee-Lo:
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me
Cee-Lo:
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title
That their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse
place
Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know
Who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only
Science and math are universal
Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with followin' I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and
Can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
Well, I've lived and I've learned
I've taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I have cried
I failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pourin rain
I found joy through my pain
Just wanna be happy...bein me
Bein me


"Ga-ga-gangbusters!!"

Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde
and shit, wreckin we live and shit
This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet
I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set
Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see It's Yours
Study scrolls that includes the clause
Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal
with the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle
Get zapped and zipped in the duffle
Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this!
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him
But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
"Just get on down.."

[Common]
Underground under pressure, my style is the child
of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled
your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz
like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wipin your nose like you need blows
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
"Just get on down.."

[Pos]
It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip
Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid
of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid'
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still takin rappin for a joke
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit
that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine
Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank

Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
"Just get on down.."
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down!!!
"Just get on down.."

[cut and scratch of "Just get on down.." to the song's end]


[Common]
Yo, niggaz don't want none of this
Niggaz know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more

I walk the night in rhymin armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searchin for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mariel just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is gettin traded
I drop a gem off, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so bangin niggaz say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is gettin split like decisions
Com will let it ride in collision
Vision like Coleco or tele, I battle stars in stellar...
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teethin
My reason of rhyme applies to season and time
Season of mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leavin the swine
Verbal vegeterian, squashed beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggaz I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night
Oracle arouse, niggaz don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second comin
Hummin comin towards you with power like forwards do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm Explorin you
So, wack niggaz be cool, with them, I stay cordial
Flowin room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods
And real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deletin and less savin
A praise in hell, raisin heaven
Like the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven

"Hungry hip hop junkie in the city" [scratched x3]


[Common:]
Envisioning the hereafter, listenin to Steve Wonder
On a Quest for Love like the Proceed drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and G weed from her
It's a cold world and niggaz need summer
At times my going forward seems like retreat
As I be writin rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribblin freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seemin contagious
Redeemin the ancients with ace this rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you chartin, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you sellin, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform fly-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could have sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key 20
Youngblood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollerin at the brothers, either you gon be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land, I can see my man Rashad
As he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him, when it rained, it fucked wit
him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was comin
I said it's here
It's here [echoed]


[Canibus:]
Yeah, yeah
Me and my man Com Sense
Rallyin troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at yo?

[Common:]
I'm bout to make the name Com Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

[Canibus:]
And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

[Canibus and Common:]
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(Rakim from "My Melody"(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)

[Common:]
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggaz like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him

[Canibus:]
I'm creatin the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time
So you niggaz need to stop testin me
Cuz you know you can't "F" with me
Steppin to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin you can defeat me is nothin but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What!

[scratching]
Common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron
Common, I ain't scared of no nigga

[Common:]
I persue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggaz I'm dunkin like when cops mingle
Fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin shit
The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper who's career
You could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition
>From B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference, the humbleness
But in the Chi, bumbleless
Was thinkin as a weakness were poetrys in motion
Like a bitch, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

[scratching] Fuck with Canibus [x4]

[Canibus:]
Yo, the Canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin to damage you, spittin understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral
With 360 degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get biten with venom
>From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshippers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me
Because they saw me, up in The Source chillin on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
www dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talkin to chicks
That was sweatin me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin mad trash tryin to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, comin to see you

[Common:]
It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

[Canibus:]
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

[Common and Canibus:]
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)

[Common:]
Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

[Canibus:]
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You stay scared, I'm still your worst nightmare squared

[Common and Canibus:]
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)


This the city of Chicago
The state of confusion
This style I'm using is free
Or prolly it would be if my mind was
Peep I'm behind cause
I didn't handle my function while in high school
Although I was cool
The hood I live in ain't that proper
Cause a cop a stop ya
And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty
I'm not filthy
Nor am I rich
Ain't that a bitch
Like life is
Not your wife is
See that your butter halve
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold
Is my self pride
So these here streets I strive
Like a Black Pantha
Asking can the
situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase keep it real passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals
That the Earth hate
Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait
Or worth my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R E M
Created in His own image so am i we him?
And in the middle of this crises
Shit I wonder where Christ is
Well he damn sure not in K town or in the wild hundreds
Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to receive minimum wages
Plus with a desiese that's contagious
It is fucking outrages
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the glock up
And Stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I went to the school of hard knock
On the hard blocks of the Chi
Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks
As my liver soaks
In mad Hennesy
Cause I have a bad tendency
To do a lot of drinking
But now I do a lot of thinking
Blinking, was your third eye
When you heard I
was one of the chosen
Industry doors keep closing
(sing) Watch the closing doors
But btothas still want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch
Like a sissy
Please miss me
With all that bullshit you popping
This science I'm gonna keep on droppin'
And me I won't be stoppin'
Even if you had one of them red octagon
Folks say Mylik how you make your living?
I say by breathin' oxygen


[Common:]
One two, one two, one two
Yo, I be the Big Illinois, here to build and destroy
I come on your deck, on your set
On your strip, through your burrough
Rippin any muthafucka that steps towards me
Yeah, I got power like floors be
Yo, check it out y'all

Real nigga quotes I tote, got some shit on the free but
This some shit that I wrote, legendary like the goat
Who got game?
Giving a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album, niggaz was expectin, now my water broke
Before it, I was sorta broke
Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown tryin to get home
Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone
>From the wind storm, I've been told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw, don't talk to broads that are spoke for
That provokes war, stand out like cold sores
You claim that you hard but you wholecore
George Bush and CIA, you movin old or
Write like mention for publishin but you sold yours

[chorus: Dug Infinite]
Com got rhymes, Dug make beats
Style complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet
(on the real)You know the shit be real [x5]
(down on the real to real)

[Common:]
Chicka-chicka-M-chicka-C-chicka-M and my
People call me Com and collective with prospective
I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sounds, tell yo bitch to calm down
Unless you want to get me skull askin me to take my hat off
On ill raps, I spit as if I had a bad cough
This Craig nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playin yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property, crew is formin colonies
Commonly, I hear these rats thinkin they mahogany
On every rap hook, soundin like a dog to me
In a reservoir, I flow and go
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion, hit makers get blown
[scratching] (on the real)

[chorus: Dug Infinite]

[Common:]
R and B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent, them niggaz whole style is silent
I hate to Staple the singers together, but in my head
It's been ringin forever...and a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
Where all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me
MCs be insecure, like them little hoe niggaz Immature
Wearin bobs, if I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob
Bukein niggaz and pullin broads is the apparent job
(scratching)(on the real)

[chorus x2]
(don't front) [echoed]


[Common]
Yeah, yeah, what, yeah
Reminding me of Sef, what?
Fat fat thick booty, what?
You say jack that big booty, yo
He say OOH OH
I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it

Driftin on a memory, brought forth
from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said, "Dumb bitch"
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

[Chorus: Chantay Savage]

It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

[Common]
Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
and start thinkin they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin
Saved my day, dancin on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

[Chorus]

[Common]
There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it

Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

[Chorus]


Yo, we gotta start respectin life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
Brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin
We losin too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it

Knowin you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of
The start of somethin, I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I woulda fed this information I read
to someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggaz with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on
I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause $315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth it

[Lauryn Hill: two layers of vocals, same words]
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
[Common] Yo
Why didn't you stay

Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An intergration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin, more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin spendin the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my writin
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of Afrikan names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

[Lauryn Hill]
I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
You said you would be here when it rained
Ohh I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situation's made things change
Things change
Why, didn't you stay
Why didn't you stay...
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer
In summer
You said you would be here when, it rained
When it rained, it rained
Ohhhohh I, never dreamed, you'd leave in summer
You said you wouldn't leave
Now the situation's made things change
Things change, why didn't you stay?
Stay, stay stay stay stay stay stay
Mmmmm, stayyy
Uh-uh
Ohh why didn't you stay..


[Common:]
Down da-down-da-down-down-down, what [x3]
Down-da-down, check it, check it

There was a Hardy boy mystery I was tryin to solve
Can't understand who the fuck was involved
Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My God came and grabbed in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart nailed
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swingin and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggaz is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came during the day when at work, they was found
At the mount I stand folded than tie
Askin who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked
About to go wild hunted
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray, I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
With the beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kickin what shit was left all around the house
Thinkin whoever came in on me is out

[chorus]
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me now
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, yes it is
(What can I do?)
It's a frantic situation
It's a frantic situation, hear me y'all
(What can I do?)


[Black Thought:]
It's a frantic situation [x7]

[Common:]
Extra salty cuz whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snappin, my God tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggaz was over my crib gettin smoked out
No tellin who had the place scoped out
Donnie brought over some niggaz I didn't know
I'm askin, who are you, they said I'm with the Mo
If it was them, soon I will collide with them
And they better not be rockin no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car, he would know
Now, it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib
To have the set of keys but that I wasn't tryin to believe
But I could have put it past him or those other bastards
It would be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
Cuz whoever did ain't gon admit it
The blunted dirty dishes is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind
It might surface
Cuz tellin Allah, Joe is worthless(uh)

[chorus x2: Black Thought]
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are [x3]
Wherever you are, whoever you are
Check it out


[Q-Tip:]
Hey , hey, hey, hey,
Hey, who dat? Hey, who dat?
Hey, who dat? Check it, what
Hey sucka nigga, whoever you are [x2]
Hey sucka nigga, hey sucka nigga
Whoever you are, whoever you are

[Common:]
Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin
Somewhat like the girl X-ratin
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breakin in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smokin weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breakin in, chillin and eatin
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck

[Excerpt from a movie]
Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fuckin money, alright?
(fighting)
Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit

[Q-Tip:]
Know what I'm sayin. Word up
It ain't sweet when you do that shit [x7]


[Sample:]
Gluttony baby
Is I needs what I see
Gluttony baby
Is us, aside to seat two

[Intro:]
Itâs knocking
Man, they gon, they gon, man they gon knock this one
Ride out to this

[Verse 1:]
It sit deep in my chest, so let me express
Grew up on 868, oh yâall donât need the address
It was âround CVS, we were so devious
The city never sleeps, it be needing some rest
The streets was a mess, and they still are
Feel our pain, the bigger picture, we was all framed
But the game is the game, so let it begin
In these streets, these are the seven deadly sins
Now the first is pride, though some call it vanity
A hustlerâs insanity can break up the family
Pride can have a man stuck in his ways, not subject to change
Knowing that Iâll end up in a grave
Itâs the arrogant [?] saying us Americans
Messes up marriages, many sins, pride is parenting
Like the second is something we all have
Or felt, then cane or khan, itâs called wrath
I seen a boss take it out on his staff
I seen a crip take it out on a blood, causing a bath
Never seen a man making money while he mad
So hustle plus wrath, yâall do the math
Now the third, you probably heard from MOB
They say use them rocks to make em envy
Envy, the cousin of jealousy, on the streets itâs a felony
When niggas fucking hit you up [?] fidelity
They hate it, to see you celebrated
Counting my paper, nigga you could have made it
Let me stay with that part, takes us to the fourth
Where niggas is lazy, thatâs what we call sloth
Want you to break em off, getting money it costs
For you to be a boss, ainât no taking off
Now the myth about the fifth, it only happens when we eat
Itâs gluttony, this is how it happens on the street
Itâs a dude thatâs getting paid in full, causing [?]
Always played his four, but the way this nigga move
He is never full and he gon want your food
Donât overdo it, thatâs an underrated rule
The sixth is a fix thatâs in all of us
When I get drunk and want to bust, this is what we call lust
When the drawers go down, the guards go down
Cause a pussy is somebody getting robbed right now
Okay the seventh is a seed that many believe
Is the cause of em all, this is what we call greed
Knew some cousins that was hustling, one of em ended up busting the other
Greed is a mother, itâs greedy motherfuckers like Madoff
Cops getting paid off, greedy companies got my people getting laid off
Before I sign off, in the sins we living
The good thing is we can be forgiven
The seven deadly sins

Blak Majik [x32]

[Verse 1 - Common:]
Who that boy he radical
Talk that money talk emphatical
Who in the game had the baddest hoes
Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "I seen what you was on"
Home grown with no home phone
From the city of wind nigga, win or go home
It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
Hit them cones, clips and crones
I don't play away games, I got hitters at home
I'm a dime like six in the morn'
Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones
Go hard like pyramid stones
Stand the test of time cross the burning sands
With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme
I invest in time
Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm

[Hook - Jhene Aiko:]
Blak Majik [x16]

[Verse 2 - Common:]
Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical
I ride fun facts that's actual
Keep it one hunnid that's natural
To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow
Shout out to black and DC make it capital
I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more
Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo'
Got a whole lot so we can have some mo'
So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more
Clap clap, home of the original gang bangers, gun clappers, no lackers, rack stackers
Movie, we are black actors
Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik
What I do, I own like magic
Status of the livest and established
Girl with the fattest, I'm givin' you the gladdest
Like you ever had this magic

[Break - Jhene Aiko:]
Neewteb ni tsixe I ereh ton ma I
Maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma I

[Verse 3 - Jhene Aiko:]
I am the matter that cannot be seen
I am the conscious you have in your dream
Do not be scared of my dark energy
I am not here I exist in between
Yeah that's me I'm magical
I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro
I'm nothing you have had before
I'm everything but nothing more

[Hook - Jhene Aiko]


The city, it blow deep, I know them cold streets
Motif is no peace, can't trust the police 
My momma stay out east, hope that she good though 
She from Inglewood so she know the hood though
Corners we stood on, that's what I stand for
Justice for hustlers, I rap and I chant for
Cuzzo just got out, that thang on his ankle
He seein that corner from a new angle
Same ol' to same ol', some days are painful
They say be careful, grandma stay prayerful
My bros move birds with they eyes on the sparrow
You in the ghetto where we never settle

The breath of the city, no rest for the weary
No stress, it can't hear me, a fist full of fury
No dollars, no jewelry, a Chicago story
Place that could kill me is one that could cure me
Hard to ignore me cause we livin loud now
Fire inside me and thangs that go BLAOW BLOAW!
Label me wild child, my old man on trial now
Yeah I'm the future, but live for the now now
Make my momma proud now, we come from that dirt
I put in that work, until my back hurt, uh


[Intro - Big Sean:]
(Oh) Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppinâ
Champagne poppinâ, bad thing poppinâ
Headed to the door, and ainât a damn thing knockinâ (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbinâ
Campaign poppinâ, champagne poppinâ

[Verse 1 - Common:]
I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gonâ do it gourmet
Iâm hearing fuckinâ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gainways
Learned strange ways between [?] and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Was about paper, pussy, Prada, ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frÃ­o
Thatâs Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pino noir style, better with time
Iâm gambling with watches getting better with time
So Iâmma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say âtime is moneyâ, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

[Hook - Big Sean:]
(Oh) Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppinâ
Champagne poppinâ, bad thing poppinâ
Headed to the door, and ainât a damn thing knockinâ (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbinâ
Campaign poppinâ, champagne poppinâ
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppinâ (no)

[Bridge - Big Sean:]
Ay, ay, ay , ay , ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day

[Verse 2 - Common:]
Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
[?] of consignment, Godâs in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas thatâs behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the benz leaning like we biased
I seen lead fly by us, that shit scary
You can go cold and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
Iâmma be shining âtil I die man
Iâmma rare diamond thatâs hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 to 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ainât no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond

[Verse 3 - Big Sean:]
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
Iâm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballinâ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say âI need that fadeawayâ
Had a crush on whatâs her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you canât take his chain away
Real play you canât take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you canât take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, thatâs my favorite combination
Diamonds


[Snoh Aalegra:]
Black and blue outside, his soul carries a heart of gold
Misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
The child she brings into the world doin right from wrong 
It's all it is, all it is, she deserves more

[Common:]
Red lipstick - bold, French press - cold
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin money, the ass is stupid, she far from a dummy 
Funny I thought she came from money how she makin money
At the club, goin hard like liquor
Shots of Ciroc, she can outdrink a nigga
Niggaz dig her, think they can take her to the crib and break her,
Move her, shake her, you can't fake her, she knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-ah! Glaciers on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer, ah-ah
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer, Beamer Benz 
She got friends in high ends, she know trend she know when
She go in like an investor.. yessir!
Never gettin gassed like a Tesla, ain't 'bout all that extra
Destiny brought her, to where niggaz bought her a lot of shit
She ain't caught up, bitches taught her to hustle
Hustle harder than a nigga

[Chorus:]
(Uh-huh) She hustle harder than a nigga 
(True) She hustle harder than a nigga 
(Uh-huh) She hustle harder than a nigga (True)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it-get it)
She hustle harder than a nigga (She get it-get it)

[Common:]
She bad, uh uh, she bad
Don't complain about it but she let you know when she on that rag
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
Many aspects emphasis sophisticated and ratchet
She fasted for a week, that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother/father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know EVERYBODY
Devil in a tight dress something there that is godly
She know what niggaz want, she know how to make 'em hunt
Hotel suite at the Trump, the way she walk in them pumps
Talkin 'bout, takin over the world while holdin a blunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin, she movin movin and shake it like Parkinson's
Used to seel hot purses, and network marketing
Eye shadow darker than than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like, she hustle harder than a nigga

[Chorus]

[Dreezy:]
Uh, it's Dreezy
Look, I be livin like I need a Lamborghini
I make it happen, I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini, threw away that fettuccine
I been goin to the gym, I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'm a, smart chick but I never wen to Harvard
I'm like a Nina got designer for my armour
Lookin for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggaz heads like a barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who probably driving a Honda but savin for that Mercedes
This is for my pretty women that know that they independent
You say that her shit is rented, she probably get offended, man
The new kid like a transfer
I'm known to set trends, let 'em copy like the answers
I could be a lady in the streets but in the booth I pull triggers
Shots fired, I go harder than a.. nigga

Afternoon, breezy afternoon too 
The winds out west at fourteenth gusting at 22 O'Hare
High today 62, maybe some rain tonight, a low of 40 degrees
60 at O'Hare midway 61, the lake front at 60 and Wheeling sunny at 60


[Spoken:]
I do dirt, in search of a clear mind
Money talk, somebodies gonna hear mine
Grind early before 9: 30
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death, you heard me?
My world ain't worldly, any time could be my time
I get high, but still ain't seen Chicago skyline
In my prime, stakes is high cause it's beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents, we want the same face
And to think, me and the president, we from the same place
Four-hundred and twenty-one murders, ain't tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven, will I make it through the main gate?

[Intro:]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom
Ooh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh

[Verse 1 - Common:]
Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap, he was about to get put on
At his funeral, listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming, I hurt for 'em
A cold world that's why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I'm a need to go back, I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets, that's the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch, cost my man his life, I can't afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him, his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

[Hook:]
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh (sing)
Help me get, get the keys to the kingdom (yeah)
Ooh
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh
(And the streets say)
(And the people say)
(And we all say)
Ah yes, my Lord, Ah, Oh
(And the streets say)
(And the people say)
(And we all say)

[Verse 2 - Common:]
My money ain't straight, my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push kis, heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin', couldn't get no work
You created me from dust, that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse, what's this cash really worth?
My whole life I had to worry about eatin'
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come?
I'm coming back like the Prodigal Son, and I got a son
And I don't want my waves following him, the streets swallowing him
And I don't want no hollows in him, his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it's the good things, 'til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son, do I have the keys to get in?

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Vince Staples:]
Sweet Lord Jesus, tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see, got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat, eat whatever's on your plate
Save some for me, the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free
We still wading in the water, cocaine, blunts, marinating in the water
Lean and took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap, niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust, leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control, just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse, they wasn't for show, I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day, bare faced, giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you? They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys
To the kingdom

[Hook x3]


[Verse 1:]
Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
His voice rare, talk with a mumble
Chicago Bearhead, caught up at the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Raction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
Watch him winning, hope your team do the same
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
Take a nigga spot, take a nigga fame
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
A team full of hitters, so they hit and run
The prestone even want none
Walk with the G's cause the G's never run
Something to be from the slum and be the one
This is where he at, this is where he from

[Hook:]
Where I'm from [x16]

[Verse 2:]
Living life with no fear
Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
It's the circle of life, that's why we're turning
Yo, I hit a choir and a sermon, our messiah is returning
With a tile around my neck, a style around respect
Know the smell of good pussy and the sound of a tec
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
The way of the road is our ode to the legacy
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Find it forever be, the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building that mean I got equity
Where articles are black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking long charity
No fear, I say that with levity

[Hook]


[Common:]
I'm from Chicago, nobodyâs smiling
Niggaz wyling on Stoney Island
Where the chief and the president come from
Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the ops come
Pop some, ops run
This ainât a game nigga, ain't no options
Niggaz sellin on the block like an auction
Dig into my pockets, see a profit
Where the money and the bitches is where the gods is
Godfathers in the lodges, at the spot 
Holdin money, like a hostage
She went ostrich.. from the projects with posture
I draw with the goddess like an artist
Gettin paper with no margins, money gods
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin, yo

[Common:]
In the Chi, ain't a damn thing funny
Thinkin of ways to get money
Drive down Lake Shore, schemin how to make more
If we ain't eatin together, what is this cake for?
Ain't nobody givin it, that's what we take for
Niggaz is broke, what I need a break for?
Glaciers of ice, lasers and lice
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Made for the life, ball out like we out of bounds
Bars and guns, niggaz got a lot of rounds
..Trippin like you from out of town
The fo'-pound'll leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain't no fathers 'round, +Sons of Anarchy+
Fightin attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I'm in the inner city, it's an out-of-body.. experience

[Malik Yusef:]
Face on T-shirts with no #hashtags
Just big-ass trash bags tagged hash
Out here, shit been trill
Fake-ass gangster, quick to take a fagâs cash
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9's
Two trey 8's, and one fo'-fives
Tryna get to two-threes, the numbers game
Then here come the fame, but they won't say no names
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town?
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings
They drillin on my land but ain't no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can't e'en moonwalk
My lil' cousin Bump J don't know what he did when he introduced that goon talk
Is there a Scarface castin at the crib I don't know about?
So many shortys have tried out for the role
That's why he slide out and ride out with the pole
Now I see how my daddy felt the dark day he discovered 
that black power didn't keep the lights on
Right on, the dearly departed still rappin to you
Lookin for some yellow, white, red, black, brown flesh to write on
How long will they mourn me after I'm out of mind, out of sight, gone
A crash, a head-on collision affects both riders the most
G.O.O.D. Music in the building 
Yeah we got ghost writers, they just actually ghosts


[Common:]
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Plastic bag carryin, no toothpastes
iPhone, belt by Gucci
Bands with loose change and some car keys
To the Maserati, license plate read 'GODBODY'
Passenger side only ride hot bodies
When we was young as we wanted, show our bodies
Cadillac Com from the Southside army
The army now, don't try to harm me now
It's my time, you can't alarm me now
I ball, bitches wanna palm me now
Vacation in palm tree style
In the morning where the dons be now
Drinkin lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with an ashe
Cops say we lookin for a nigga thats dressed nice
Seats be goin way back just like Just-Ice
Black leather wearin justice on the collar
Change is we only ain't trustin the dollars
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
Poli' with technique, and let the text speak
Like the led conference I rap off the head conscience
Freestyle, free trap niggaz from bondage
Every word you heard is bond is
Double-0-87, on some Bond shit, I'm out on bond

[Chorus:]
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames (I'm out on bond)
Preposterous chains, top notch dames

[Vince Staples:]
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Los Padrinos to juvenile placement
All for C-notes, the feds confiscatin
Back to that block with brains on the pavement
Paid restitution, O from the lootin
Took cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
than your time zone, broke as the rich get richer
Blunt-burnt lips and a worn-out liver
That's everyday livin, guns everywhere chillin
Got you feelin like there's money comin sooner than later
'Til then, I'll be runnin from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin cause these women love a man in Mercedes
I never save for when it's rainy, hope Jehovah can save me
While I'm out dumb buyin, tryin to find my time
'Til I hit the main line in that cell confined

[Chorus]

Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin in the Range
...
Preposterous chains, top notch dames
Classic rap music, rollin in the Range


[Hook - Elijah Blake:]
You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Niggas ain't on
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
And we know the deal
Yeah we know the deal

[Verse 1 - Common:]
Eighty seven strip walker
I'm a shit talker
Fuck all night your dependent what I'm offer
Had a white girl I tossed her
Black girl I lost her
Break bread with the stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar
Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth 
I was first with a verse live niggas don't rehearse
Wear the prophets on the shirt
Yeah yeah that's the creed
I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave
I tell you when you look good and keep it right there
I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air
Jordan threes on the feet as we breeze down lakeshore
These are the days that we bake more to make more
I been living in the moment lately
It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me
Lady lady, that body crazy
You been working out of this thing if it's not tell me if it's really real

[Hook - Elijah Blake:]

[Verse 2 - Common:]
I'm the sole controller
Opposite of sober
Flow from the south side to south Angola
Mami wanna strip then yeah I'mma poke her
And go all in and stretch it out like yoga
I'm flexin' sexin' oiled up like Texan
Survivor soldier a child is destined
A star is born in a Chicago storm
The name is Common
I'm anything but the norm, uh
Six in the mornin' something warm informing
I'm sweatin' like I'm performing on tour in, uh
Y'all fuckin' with this like porn
Put ya fists up cuz you know I ride on
New planes and plateaus
Made it through the black hole
I rhyme in a timeless capsule
I rap fo', niggas in the barber shops and broads thats hot
I run the town I'm a fuckin juggernaut
This shit is real

[Hook - Elijah Blake (x2)]


"Rewind that one time, please"

Should it be, can it be simple?
Life is like the tempo of a No I' instrumental
Things that we been through define who we are now
Since "Can I Borrow a Dollar?", ooh, I'm a star now 
Comin from Chi-town, we was the first to do it
Me, No I.D., Twilite Tone on the music
The city on our back, we was the opening act
Throw our tapes in the crowd, they throw 'em right back
But we stayed on track, they stayed on the tracks
I stayed on the raps 'til we made it on the map
By then, No I' was my main guy
He and I was like Chi-Town's GangStarr
We had came far together, with (ALONGWAYTOGO)
Seein a bigger picture, but now from different angles
Tangle of the hustling, survival in the game
Felt I had to leave home to be a household name
Show money low, needin to stack fast
City did have my back, now it's a backlash
Was I a slave to the cash and wantin it so bad?
I just became a dad, rap is all I had
So I moved to New York, to make it pop
Did "Like Water for Choc", that album changed a lot
But my man who I started with, wasn't a part of it
And his presence, I didn't even acknowledge it
Knew I was wrong, he shoulda at least had a song
It wouldn't be me without No I.D., and Twilite Tone
Wishin' I could get that time back
Oh I can, yo man, rewind that
Me and Dion back in the zone, I'm doin shows with Tone
For the future of the Chi, we gon' bring it back home
Rewind that and we can do it again
No I.D., Twilite Tone, where the story begin

"Rewind that one time, please"

This one's for my man J Dilla
As I say these words, my eyes fill up
Cause wasn't none realer than James Dewitt Yancey
So I'ma dedicate this to Dilla and his family
In Q-Tip's basement, I first met Jay Dee
I still remember the first beat he played me
He came to the Chi late three that was crazy
Didn't even know me and gave 'em to me for free
I go the the D, he show big love
Cook up some hot shit, then go to the strip club
Then we made "The Light" and times got brighter
I said "Turn it up!" Jay'll take it +Higher+
One day, I noticed he was tired quick
That's when I found out, Jay Dee was real sick
Things got worse before they got better
I said, "Come to L.A. for peace and good weather"
We got an apartment just so we can spark it
MP in the front room, records in the closet
The beats got iller, but the sickness was still there
I'm wishin, I could will him out of his wheelchair
It was hard for me to come home every day
And see my homie Jay's life fade away
I stayed away some times, in other words I ran
'Til one day J brought me this TV stand
It was a gift so I couldn't refuse it
It came from his heart, I regret I didn't use it
The lupus got worse and, for what it's worth
I wanted him to have a Grammy before he left this earth
Wishin we could have that time back
Oh we can, yo man, rewind that

You never gone, you live forever through song
I feel it when I see 'em with them Dilla shirts on
I know you still +Shining+, from heaven you watch me
Watch me put this Grammy on the stand you got me

"That's an um..infinite.. an infinite um.. team right there
Man Jay Dee, I'd work with him whenever I can
Cause he's like, constantly progresssing and growing
He's one of the greatest producers.. yo, greatest musicians of our time
F'real, I really know that.. (Aight!) Yeaaaah... yeah, yeah
Like I used to be able to wake up in the morning and hear J Dilla beats... being made
Y'know I mean.. really, used to walk by me like.. damn, I'm blessed
Like I really felt that, like during the time where he was making it match
Like, I don't look back and say I was blessed, I know I was blessed during that time
I look and say.. 'Man! I'm gettin to see Jay make them beats.. everyday!'
Y'know..."

[J Dilla:]
"Common, okay for me it's definitely not a common out
But... it's Common"


[Hook - The Notorious B.I.G. (x3):]
I just, speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packing, my piece, Jesus
Packing, my piece, Jesus

[Verse 1 - Common:]
I'm iller than most, sick with it, feeling the dose
In a butter soft leather but I'm still with the toast
Toast to bros, you know the millions is close
Feel the ghost of Notorious, tell me who the naughtiest
She get live like an audience
I do what I do, no need to state the obvious
Poli' with girls with bodies, uh
Poli' in hotel lobbies
Light a J, it's just me and Marley, look at the poster
Do what I supposed to for the culture
Early b-boy, down with d-boys, build and destroy
My pride and joy is my daughter named Omoy
'Ye, that's my nigga from back in the day
All that whoop-de-wah-whoop, man fuck what they say
Played the lotto for my gram with a bottle in hand
Lay it down for the world, for Chicago I stand, and

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Common:]
Yeah, yeah, they like that, I write raps from on top of the world
Popular girls always wanna pop in my world
I pop out in the boroughs and go to L.A. to get hay
In the middle of the barn with a princess I laid
Yo, this type of shit happens every um, once in a while
You know I won't front with the style
Bring life to the party like a woman and child
From the land of the humble and proud, summers is wild
Ah! Made the unmade-able
Ah! Go to parties I'm paid to go
Me and cuzzo talked the hustle
About doing good business like Rick and Russell
You I know I guzzle red wine till it's bed time
On my paper like headlines, she want the head shine e'ry time
My time, the streets is watching like a Rollie
Do it for the hometown and the homies, uh

[Hook x10]


[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Thousand lives ago
We were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice
Headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

[Sample]
I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

[Verse 1: Common]
Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones?
And Four Corner Hustlers, Vice Lords, Stony Island on Aces
The concrete matrix, street organizations
They gave violations, hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases, bad broads, good graces
The hustles was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan, the terror of Bush
Crack babies, momma's a push, we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
A bad ho to [?] do me, you heard of flukey?
Stokes it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke, herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds, blinding us so real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on seats, Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

[Interlude]
You know they don't see sometimes
That in the neighborhood
It's the exact same thing
It's the same thing over and over again
Feel me?

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Have you ever heard of no limit, three hundred, six hundred?
Folly boy, O block, eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence, why my city keep lyin'?
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up, watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later, I been cool, chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib, big fam, mom was workin', grammy raised us
No food in the refrigerator, I was bangin', pullin' capers, that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy, yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox, and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases, judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

[Outro]
Coming inbound
Forty six minutes from 355
Jim Bryant's twenty eight out, thirty two in
Lake Shore Drive's heavy south
North Avenue to Chicago, jammed north through Grant Park
Tri State heavy south [?] to the Bensenville Bridge and St. Charles to the Stevenson Ramp
Get traffic and weather together on the 8's every ten minutes on News Radio, 780 and 105.9 FM


[Intro - Common:]
State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplated with wine
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplated with wine

[Verse 1 - Common:]
I put the line down when I put the rhyme down
Lost on my own Stoney Island that I found
I ride around town like this is my town
Rap to myself, tryna see how I sound
Kinda arrogant cause Iâm from Chi Town
East bound it down, thatâs how we get down
At the bar takinâ shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is itâs good to be alive now
Lot that surround me, places all cloudy
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq whereâs war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildy is how we came up
Think about the come up
Thatâs why Iâm always on edge when the fans seem to run up
Hair all done up, we can spend the summer together
But when the weather change, lady friend
You may be forever stranger lines seem to blur
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
I come from the other, wonder why they slumbered on a nigga
Now I see the bigger picture, pour a little liquor
The rich get richer, my dick get bigger
Cause Iâmma go hard, g-go g-go hard
The more I know self, the more I know God
Coppinâ land from my bro [?]
Good to do business with the bro-gods, let the dollar circulate
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
In touch with the crib thatâs why you feel this shit
The willingness to grow, the willingness to blow
The willingness to know that I donât know shit

[Bridge 1 - Cocaine 80âs:]
But I still wanna know
What the fuck you on girl

[Verse 2 - Common:]
Enrichened souls, visions, goals, mission grows as I do
It was written like a haiqu when I was seventeen
I used to sell a [?] to forever dream
Now Iâm a champagne king like Evelyn
Young hearts run free and forever sing
Yea

[Bridge 2 - Cocaine 80âs:]
Tell me what the fuck you on
Cause your heart is sayinâ ohh, ohh, ohh â run

[Intro x2]

It was red, I guess it had to be the bloodshed
Love shed, ânough said

[Bridge 3 -Cocaine 80âs:]
But I still wanna know
What the fuck youâre on
Cause your heart is sayinâ ohh, ohh, ohh â run
And Iâm down to jump the gun with you
Tell me what the fuck you want
Cause your heart is sayinâ ohh, ohh, ohh â run
And Iâm down to jump the gun with you

[Verse 3 - Cocaine 80âs:]
What the fuck Iâm sâpossed to do, you not around
Iâmma talk about when we high and Iâm on the ground
Always hold you down in and outta town
Maybe Iâm a clown got me crying out in front the crowd
On the inside but it feel like a fuckinâ cloud
Out my fuckinâ mind, Iâmma fuckinâ drown
Girl but Iâm not gonna fuck around
Iâmma fuckinâ marry you and learn to swim
Let me carry you I need to hit the gym
Young hard jab but the difference is
Got young love but Iâm not young
Faith in love but Iâm not dumb
I donât need to give a fuck about the outcome
Niggas be scared but Iâm not one [x5]


[Common:]
Living in a glass bubble, the fast hustle
The masked struggle that I'm in
The same one that you in
I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Had to take it a step further
The way that Ralph tried
Oh that's my stepfather
He stressed harder to make that bed and lock them doors
For the perfect picture, I forgot to pose
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free
In the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
Telling me what I can't be
But you can't paint me
Black is the color of my true love spirit
And I do love lyrics
And I used to love Harold's Chicken
And I dance pretty good
And I feel at home in the hood
And I get lit in the club
Still I love

[Syd Tha Kyd:]
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

[Common:]
If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
They count me out cause I did a crime
They say it's violent time in human beings
But being they ain't seeing me as human
In this big business called prison, I'm the one that's consuming
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
Mutilate me from my family, society, and loved ones
I wasn't raised to love guns, well maybe toy ones
My pops, y'all built and destroyed him
With prescriptions of poverty, dope, and unemployment
When will we see enjoyment?
I smile when my little boy get to visit for about 30 minutes
But we ain't never spent Christmas together
Tryna get it together
What I'ma do when I get out?
I don't know what it is to live out
Just reminiscing of the big house
I'm the one justice chose to spit out
My life story is written in a prison sentence
Wonder if this cell got room for forgiveness?
Still I love

[Syd Tha Kyd:]
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom
If you look in my eyes, you'll see love deep inside
When I look in the sky, I see freedom

[Bilal:]
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive
What you got inside make you go outside
The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah

[Bilal:]
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah
It's gonna be you and me
When you're feeling free
Make you feel alive

The change in I
Is the realest high
It's the realest high
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-yeah


He was a big guy from Tyler, Texas... and... uh I think we walked in the class one day and we passed each other... and he was country, country so he was like... "Heyyy lil mama"... and I giggled... I was like, "Heyyyyy"


[Common:]
Here we go, here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language, stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk?
Same man that stole the lamb from cheap black smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And rap for black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mother's stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other, it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop (war)
And the battle with us
I know that black lives matter and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation, mass incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The rose of the help and the gangsters is really all they gave us
We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar and greasy foods
I don't believe the news or radio, stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story, black America again

[Sample - James Brown:]
You know, you know, you know. One way of solving a lot of problems we got is to let a person feel like somebody and a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is, and where he come from, and where he come from

[Common:]
Hot damn, black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made, I inherited it from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger, we got annointed singers
Like Nina, Marvin, Billy, Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me? Lincoln or Cadillac
Drinking or battle raps so is it Godspeed that we travel at?
In danger denied on habitat
The guns and dope man y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact, we them lab rats
You build the projects for us now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap you would express it to
That PTSD, we need professionals
You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison y'all, they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making broke laws to spite us
You know, you know we from a family of fight trust
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two
And then, maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold this truth to be self evident
All men and women are created equal, including black Americans

[Sample - James Brown:]
You know, you know, you know. One way of solving a lot of problems we got is to let a person feel like somebody and a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is and be proud of what and who he is, and where he come from, and where he come from

[Common:]
A man who's genius and freedoms and -
Ability to communicate and -
To talk, and to touch chords -
A man who has the ability and the audacity
And the - of God to stand up, to stand up

Heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice from the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write songs for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Tell them to invest in us and make testaments about each other
Or how we sisters and brothers
Cover the land in corners of poems and stone
Go hard with it, let em know you God with it
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first weeks sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring them back to the Mass
The staff can be your microphone
Your name is Common
You was born to fight the norm
Take house niggas outta darkness till they lights is on
I'm a put a hyphen on your name
Rapper-actor-activist
You the one that can reach into the black abyss
Stars this asterix, show em what a classic is
Freedom riders need passengers
And your lyrics use scriptures and passages
To make them rise like Lazarus
And resurrected again, they'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say 'fuck em'
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in

I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered

[Bilal:]
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live
Going home to live
Going home to live

[Common:]
Go into the wilderness like Mussa on a pilgrimage
Streets are villages, speak with diligence
And authority to fake God of pharisees and sadducees
Give them that Gardley free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
That's why I gave you artistry
Go into the hoods with the shooters and the strippers
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in circles in Hollywood, I birthed you
And Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys
Give those to your family, don't get caught up in the vanity
Or the world's insanity

[Bilal:]
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Trouble of this world, trouble of this world
Soon I will be gone with the trouble of this world
Going home to live
Going home to live
With God

[Common:]
To those of you who are unfamiliar with those words
They mean, in English, 'Peace, be unto you'


[Intro:]
For his goodness and for his wonderful works
Unto the children of men
If my people will lift my name tonight
I will come in
I will be exalted
I will be glorified
I will be lifted up
Welcome him in tonight
Can't you feel him?
Yes, yes
There is liberty
Open your heart tonight
Welcome him in, put them hands together
Fellowship
Joy and peace

[Common:]
All praise to the all-eye seeing
Supreme-being, giver of joy and peace
Love supreme freedom
Some see him in the son
Some see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had
I was talking to my dad
He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem"
Is this a God dream the way Ye sing it?
The dream seem to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours till you create it in the image of the
Beneficent, merciful, universal, versatile
My verses go till' heaven and earth become reversible
Christ particle, so anything is possible
Fuck big brother, father, mother
God is watching you

[Bilal:]
And I want the joy
And I want to know the peace of mind
I make a way, a way to see
Through it all and ohh
Living for joy and peace
Still in all in the night when it hurts
And your bed feels like snow
There's a joy in the rain
In your heart, there's a way
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on
Turn your light on


[Common:]
Southern leaves, southern trees we hung from
Barren souls, heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating, fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method, of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us? Lord willing!
For now we know, the new Jim Crow
They stop, search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

[Common:]
The caged birds sings for freedom to bring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being, a pastoral scene
Slavery's still alive, check Amendment 13
Not whips and chains, all subliminal
Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty, incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business, America's the company
Investing in injustice, fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them, so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

How should I begin?
This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
As I said it, the spirits enwhip me
He was raised in the belly of the city
Chicago
Discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman
That I had to mention
Extensions of a young man livin' on a low end
47th and Michigan, lackin' a little discipline
Grandma Mable did the best she could
You know how young brothers want a testy hood
There he stood, taller than most Black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
Collagen, Ohio, this is like his bio
Talks that we had, man, they was never idle
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
He talked how he smoked dope and sold it for survival
He talked about the ancestors, in our lives; they're vital
He said y'all boys love the bang 'cause you tribal
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
6'9", big heart, big mind
He he spent his whole life tryin' to be big time
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message"
It was his messages in life I would step with
Didn't see him much, spirits are connected
Father creates it, the son can reflect it
His perspective: sometimes seemed crazy
His perspective: sometimes seemed brilliant
His perspective: somehow it shaped me
His perspective: undoubted I feel it
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em"
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Breathing heavy, he talked reparations
He said, "Son, we live through our generations"
Offspring, coughing, Gene Ammons was playing
In the background, he was talking, I was praying
Our Father, take care of my father
As far as he went, may I go farther
May our dreams and legacies live through our children
Though I can't touch him, I can still feel him

As Pops would always say, "Keep the peace"


[PJ:]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Common:]
I'm on what? What you on to?
I'm the sun God, let me warm you
Out of my sides the Lord formed you
Pull your dress up, ain't nothin' formal
Our fragrance is patience
We can major in communication
Relatin' like cousins, though we kissin' though
Love can be sick or medicinal
A doctor of it, you gots to love it
God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin'
In your ear with somethin' it ain't clear
On your inside it appear, so somehow you're here
I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside
They say I'm a deep nigga, I'm a go way inside
Of everything you are
Cause everything you are is my lovestar

[PJ:]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Common:]
I ain't the type to be all up on your social
I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to
A choosy lover, I chose you
God's most beautiful creation, let me mold you
You already in shape, that's more love to make
Feel free when I'm with you, it's hard to escape
When we need a break
We take it
When two souls connect you can't fake it
TV shows and cakes, I know your favorite
Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it
This ain't about labels, this about fit
Since God designed, we can start our own line
Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined
We walk the runway like blaow
Bein' in love is never out of style

[PJ:]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Marsha Ambrosius:]
Heaven agrees you are all that I need down here
Cause you make it all worth it
We do this on purpose
The love we make is certain
I'm so caught in your arm
If you're lost in your thoughts
I want to be your everything forever

[PJ:]
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?

[Common:]
Forever, I wanna be forever
Forever, star
Lovestar, lovestar

A nigga told me he only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
These are pyramids from the imperial
In theory, though, low end scenario
It's sound boy burial drove me to classic material
Aerial nights blew my mind out of stereotypes
For ethereal heights, I write like Pritchard
Invisible man, pictured below with the hieroglyphicable
Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
Supreme wisdom in my system is the kick in the door
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
Now I passed life like I've been here before
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps
For me the globe is like a culdesac
Around the world in a day, find forever and I stay
I'm from the weather where they spray
There's gotta be a better way, people dying everyday
Wonder what would heaven say? Devils need to get away
From Chevrolet to Escalade, from evergreen to the everglades
I kneel where the rebels pray
Seen fifty gray, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde
The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed

[Sample - Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn

[Common:]
I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
Smoke a little, keep a high standard
The Roots are my niggas so I gotta fly bandwith
Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with
Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich
A gluten-free one at that, close my eyes see my raps
My bio is feedback from what we need rap
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
And come with that new black spiritual
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Game lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
Came the door-to-door name down the corridor of fame
I walk like an Egyptian on a mission to listen to conditions
Envision a vision of what we wishing
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Shift the paradigm with a pair of rhymes
Style Bonnie Caylor, in the sweep with Caroline
Getting dressed up under pressure, Alabama shakes on Incense rising from the dresser, child of a fresher god
Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard
Assata Shakur, I gotta do more
The light-skinned spook who got in the door
I gotta hit four, same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for
I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man
And where we land the pyramids stand

[Sample - Ol' Dirty Bastard:]
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn


The wind against my face, tells me that I must go
Can't stay around too long before my tracks gonna catch me
When they do, I've got to be somewhere in LA
So I can look at the sun and get my thinking done
And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain

The last note I sang was indeed a false behave
At some old and shabby bar, I never knew the name
But I knew I could and work that  all on my dreams
They tell me find that place, find that place

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

Deep in my destination, trying to find my destination
With LA so far away and I'm soaking cold today
Constantly it's on my mind
I'm only halfway there, I'm not caring how much frustration
Oh, I've got to cross this nation

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain

[Common:]
As the rain falls down from the heavens
Think of how far I came since '87
Took my hustle and made it a weapon
I was always told "in the pain there's a blessing"
Mistakes that I made, they mirrored the lessons
Talking with God, I asked clearer questions
Dear Lord, is this what I'm destined for?
If so? Then what am I stressing for?
We tight, then why can't I let it go?
Everything gon' be alright, it's more than a metaphor
Let it rain cause it's ancestral
Cleanse my heart so they can see the best in you
Let it rain and come down visceral
For those no longer here in the physical
Let it rain cause it's like tears from you
Just like the rain, I'll do what I'm here to do
Let it rain, I know that it's purposeful
So that it can service you and return to you
Let it rain, let the rain surround me
And never drown me, I was lost when it found me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream is where I'll be
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Imperial reign came down to crown me
Now in a dream, a dream is where I'll be

And if it's gonna rain tomorrow, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, let it rain


[Syd:]
Red wine time on the couch
Happy you agreed to hang out
Keep my head in the clouds
Keep them old names out your mouth
I can make you laugh out loud
We the only ones in the house
I can help you body wind down
Make this bottle disappear right now
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Let's stay in for the night
Maybe take a walk outside
Let's distance your pride
Me fall in love with your mind
If I look deep in your eyes
I can guess your zodiac sign
We ain't got nothing but time
We can just chill and unwind
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable
Get comfortable, comfortable

[Common:]
Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
The mood, it's the mode, it's the culture
Where there's food there's vultures
More Tony now, back then I was Sosa
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
On a plane drinking wine with Oprah
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
My dominican girl she loves soca
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Used to be a hooper, now I'm a hoper
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
I'm bound to the underground
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
How far will you go for exposure?
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Weathered the storm like I know the skies
Yea we wear the mask but I know no disguise
These signs of the times are notarized
Written by the lord of the skies mortalized
In us, I got cold through cruel winters
Grandmas, defenders, Fred Hamptons agenda
Never been good with pretenders
They lying on the king like Simba
Dinner, branzino and red wine
Quality shared time
Fucking and laughing 'til its bed time

[Elena:]
Red like my lips
Blue like past thoughts
Brown like your eyes
Just enough time
I can't think now
You're too close and Iâ¦
Might be too nice
These New York nights
Got me taking chances
I think your hands
Might look just right
If they held mine
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Get two glasses
Now I'm swimming
Off the deep end
Heightened senses
No pretending
Make my head spin
I like dancing
In my bedroom
It's just me and you
Put that tape on
Tell me what you want
Let's just make time feel, long
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You could just stay for the night
Here, let me turn down the lights
Get comfortable, get comfortable
You can let go
Passion comes from down below
We go together like so
Get comfortable, get comfortable
Let's make a toast
That we both can make the most of this time
Red wine


[Common:]
There's something 'bout this day that seem good to me
When people I ain't like is showin' love to me
Good food and the mood and the hood is free
Peace and free is the frequency
This is the day women took over
No longer over your shoulder do you have to look over
Imagine, war is now over
Mothers get medals for being courageous soldiers
On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor, the shah is Liz Dozier
Hoods feel safer, families feel closer
We all drunk in love with no need to be sober
Ladies get their hair done, and men, we notice
You get high grade Indian weaves, at the lowest
Prices, chivalry is no longer lifeless
We openin' doors and pullin' out chairs again
Things are merry, there's more marryin'
Monthly free doses of Motrin and Valerian
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
It's more love songs from the radio
Respect for the ladies, you can hear it in the flow
Egos aside, for each other we rise
Since they done give us a life, the whole world feel alive

[Bilal:]
Oh, when women take over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be

[Common:]
The day women took over, let it continue
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Body is a temple, men don't pray
Mother earth's arms around you sayin' it's okay
Toilet seats down, that's a no-brainer
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
Harriet, a soldier of truth is marchin' on
Women preachers and world leaders, it now the norm
Healthcare, payin' for nails, jails and fill-ins
Intellectual buildin', intersexual healin'
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
The New World Order is fathers lovin' their daughters
And baby's mamas supported and ladies gettin' courted
In court, kids can't be tried as adults
And women, they called B's because they a boss
In all shapes and sizes, beauty is recognized
Goddess and queens is what we use to describe
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
BeyoncÃ© made the music for the revolution
Imagine it, a world more compassionate
The malice of the feminine and masculine, I'm askin' if

[Bilal:]
Oh, what if women took over the world
Oh, every woman, boy and girl
Oh, maybe one day, we will see
Peace and unity the way it's meant to be

What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then [?] my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

Love never gave a limit, wait a minute, stay up in it
Every day we give it, play to win it, way we live it
My heart, you came to visit
Stay extended
The lap of love we lay up in it
Days is vivid same incentive
The way we hit it's like Will and Jada did it
A house is not a home unless we staying in it
Stay committed
I used to get around now I'm staying centered
Angels ascended, grounded, stay cemented
The mentality, we all casualties
I can't do this casually actually you challenge me
To balance me
Paid dues and salaries
Been through truths and fallacies
The unfamiliarity made me loose calories
In a house with wine playing Amy's "Valerie"
Then I realized the past ain't my reality
On love's balcony, you standing out for me
This is alchemy, unashamed and undoubtedly
Now I see

[PJ:]
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me
And what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..
Why don't I take the time and then [?] my baby doll?
Why don't I take the time to get you anything you want?
'Cause what you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
But I could get used to it
I could get used to it, I could get..

This love's alive, it clicks the way that T.D. Jakes described it
Vivrant thing the way that Tip from Tribe would sing
So many things that you provide the king
You too fly, never should you hide your wings
The awakening, let's keep breaking things
Breaking rules, breaking laws, breaking through
Breaking walls, sacred thoughts
Are the oceans that we make it cross
The truth is a naked cloth
No need to take it off, the wait is off
Love we make and do is unbreakable, relatable
State in you relating to the faith in you
Awaken to what faith can do
Fate is inescapable, super friends, we capable
To take it to a greater view they say is unattainable
I paint for you a picture I'm forever in it with ya
Love it when we hang, in my life, you're a fixture
A mixture of love, laughter, scripture
The right elixir, my spirit I pour to enrich ya
I'm with ya

[PJ:]
What you doing to my heart is unfamiliar
I try to keep it out my head, it's not that simple to me

They've been using this system to will their power. So Its kind of like a slippery slope to teach their children to teach your children to respect something that shows no respect. For a lack of better terms.
You know what I mean? You hit a good thing on the head saying about how educating the youth early and often about relationships going forward


[Common talking]
Yea,Yea,Yea
You know, they call me a pimp, and you know what that mean
I'm a Person that's Making Profit. See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method

[Common]
Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
and badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to

[MC Lyte]
As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried

[Common]
Motion denied [pause]
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya

[[Chorus:] Bilal singing]

Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,
customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god
Pimps, ho's, hustlers, plans, dealers,
customers, and bodies stuck in it, Oh my god

[Common]
{hey girl, come on over here, check it out)
Make your next move your best move, choose me

[MC Lyte]
How I look working for a nigga in a cuffe'
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy

[Common]
(yea ok)
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
You used to the same game, cats saying the same thang
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream

[MC Lyte]
Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me ([Common:] get real now)
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a land called cash
You too slow for me

[Common]
You know why?
I'm thinking bigger than Bagets
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws

[MC Lyte]
What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
([Common:] try it)
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy but damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
([Common:] oh it's like that)

[Chorus]

[Common]
(this, this, this really how I look at it check it)
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
Picture us elbow to elbow at the hustler's convention

[MC Lyte]
Think I'm gone risk my ass then give you the cash ([Common:] yep)
That shit is the past
I got my own stable (Common: where at)
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract

[Common]
Girl you getting beside yourself
I'm trying to guide you
Help you see inside yourself
I pimp with vision, I'm a help you see the light
Have you covering your body and have you eating right

[MC Lyte]
(is that right)
I'm pimp ho's, pimp pens, ([Common:] Say what)
Pimp rhythms, pimp flows,
Pimp men ([Common:] and pimp what)
Pimp systems
Got stores called big pimpin ([Common:] Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house

[Common]
(So)
I pimp from Brazil to um, Tokyo
Have Japanese broads sayin 'choushi wa dou' ([MC Lyte:] Yea right)
Bring'em back to the states to turn dates from Europe
Made the dirtiest of hoes seem purer

[MC Lyte]
(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggaz like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo skinny ass weekly
You'll get all the right tolls in that dashiki

[Common]
Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher

[Common talking and Bilal Singing Background]

Well there you have it ya'll
The story of pimps and hoes ya'll know how it goes

The whole thing is like a lesson

Pimps ya'll, hustlers

Yea, yea 2000 and forever
It'll be here
Uh, uh aiight cool


[Common]
In the Spirit of God.
In the Spirit of the Ancestors.
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers.
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur.
We make this movement towards freedom
for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle.
Yeah. yo, check it-

There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on
to life. She thought she'd live with no arm
that's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
"Who shot the trooper?" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was buildin as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all.

[Cee-lo vocals]
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes.
Your Power and Pride is beautiful.
May God bless your Soul.

[Common]
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies cracklin, I see 'em when they takin her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
a cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years inna hole. Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered frredom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people-

[Cee-Lo]
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Oooh.

[Common]
Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
news that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
but she's free with political asylum in Cuba.

[Cee-Lo vocals]
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.
We're molded from the same mud, Assata.
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Oooh.

[Assata]
Freedom! You askin me about freedom. Askin me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you. I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
than about what it is, cause I've never been free.
I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is.
Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
blossom.
Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are,
to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do. [fade out]

You got the C to the, huh - cold-blooded
Ain't it - huh, c'mon - hard-core
We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er

Yo, yo
My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother Com, gotta make our move through
the stylist(?) and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
after, travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya, back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done - but some days I wanna take off
D be like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
?uestlove said, "We ain't got no time for that!"
My old bird like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
we're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
to seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep
I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out
at night, when most cats pull the gun out
Go on and on and, to the break of when the
sound run out, run out, r-run out
C uhh, yeah

Cold-blooded (c'mon) cold-blooded, hard-core

The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh
These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
on the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin 'em soft
Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
with a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like Henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes

C to the, cold-blooded (yeah, c'mon)
cold-blooded, (ya know) hard-core
(ain't it) Rough and rugged, (c'mon) rugged and raw
for you and yours, for you and yours
You got the C to the, cold-blooded
cold-blooded, hard-core
Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
for you and yours, for you and yours
You got the C to the, cold-blooded (yeah, hey)
cold-blooded (na-nasty, yo yo) hard-core
Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
(ain't it, ain't it) for you and yours, for you and yours
You got the C to the, cold-blooded
cold-blooded, (c'mon) hard-core
Rough and rugged, rugged and raw
for you and yours, for you and yours..

[Common ad-libs, then some vocal samples til end]


Ah keep on, chcka chcka chcka [x6]

Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves
Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to breakdance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?

"Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"
"C O double M O to the N" [cut and scratched x4]

My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say "We gotta get over"
That juggy shit is over, the war is on
I on;y want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I "X" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him

"Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"
"C O double M O to the N" [cut and scratched x4]

You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
>From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
>From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in "The Wood"
Dick is always hard like the "Boyz in the Hood"
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to reduce aggression

"Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it"
"C O double M O to the N" [cut and scratched x4]


[Chorus: Bilal, Jill Scott]

Alright.....Okay [x4]
Alright......We'll make it funky for you now

[Common]
I'm a child of the ahh - The 87 ahh
From the streets - Get on a beat and go ahh
I could break it down like whatever ya ahh
On some K-R-S be here forever type unh
You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like unh
Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh
Baby boy you could do it take your time do it....
If you get the chance
To be a man in a b-boy stance and advanced from the go
I'll trace outer space with a unh
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....
I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual
of the real unh
Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you
You sampled real unh's and then filtered
I'm built to last - at last I'm free
The Roots and SV be the family tree
SV and the Roots be the family tree
The Roots and SV and the tree is unh
Come on

[Chorus]
As long as it's funky....alright..okay [yeah]
As long as it's funky...alright
As long as it's funky...alright...okay
As long as it's funky...funky for you now

I style for the ohhh - wild for the ohhh
Baby girl let's go half on a child for the ohhh
Lick shot's pop lock and blaow for the oohh
Like Ra-I'll move a crowd for the ohhh
You talkin' loud but ain't sayin' ohhh
Trickin' paper on a unh... Captain Save-a-ohhh
I've never been.. the type of nigga..
to take.. a broad to the courts
As a shorty I was always into sports
Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's ohhh
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled..
I bust through.. narrow gates..
with king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to
You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh
I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp
Many angel's fell to the dust
Leavin' me to trust... only a ohhh
Leavin' me to trust y'all only a ohhh
Leavin' me to trust in a - ahh ohhh ohhh ohhh
ohhh
Yo

[Chorus: x4]
As long as it's funky [yeah]
alright..okay

Let your.. imagination.. dance to the..
Dance to the.. dance to the hey
Like nobody's watchin in a b-boy stance to the hey
I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey
Yo hey.. kick in the bass you..
Chasin paper like a bitch in a race
Spit on or death, I still ain't picked up the ace
The hundred.. styles I run with thick in the race
So let's ohhh.. yeah unh hunh

[Chorus]


God bless...

[D'Angelo]
hmmmmm..., doo doooo, doo doooo, yeah..., yeah..., oooh
Know I love my baby, My baby loves me
Layin in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...

[Verse 1]
Searchin for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparrel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rockin the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feelin at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that aint what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock, or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God

[D'Angelo]
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven
Geto...

[Verse 2]
Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talkin to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will annoint you
Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for
Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and God

[D'Angelo]
I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm layin in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, ohhhhhh...

[Verse 3]
This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealin with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doin something you like to support daughters
Keepin your guys who collectin court orders
Conveyin messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hopin you could grow to it
Whether servin or a surgeon, you gon go through it
Can't imagine goin through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie ?half? helped me see Lonnie's ?fath?
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to a ?ho tep?
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God

[D'Angelo]
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby...

Messenger in the Metropolis; +Apocalypse+ here and +Now+
Niggaz know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggaz drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose
to let y'all niggaz know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggaz makin moves
that bob and weave, and niggaz with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggaz on the net, sellin my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
and people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin it when you sit indian style?
Niggaz know me as Com it's time hear me go wild
with HOT SHIT, yeah..
HOT SHIT, yeah, one two..
Came to bring it boy

(You say you got guns, then bring that shit
You say you got ones, then bring that shit
cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this) what?
(to get my man see we bout to spit some) HOT SHIT
What? No doubt.. HOT SHIT!

[Common]
Old men see visions young men dream dreams
I rock the planet - recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M.
Com Rules Everything and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
Scary the biz is like "The Blair Witch Project"
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
State senators, life twirls, most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads
Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dutch scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggaz to travel through
Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringin niggaz to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic
I said, "What shit?"
He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit

(You say you got guns, then bring that shit) uhhh
(You say you got ones, then bring that shit
cause you need a lot more ones and guns for this) uhh
(me and my man, see we known to spit this) HOT SHIT
Hot shit, yeah, yeah, uhh

[Common]
Yeah baby boy
In the place (for you and yours) to be
Da uh da uh, we got the uh ya'll
We bout to rock ya'll, we got the uh baby...
Yo yo yo check it
Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ting
I'm writin shit that I feel
Raps are Black Steel In the Hour of commotion, the motion of Com
Is like that of a ocean, devotion cuz I'm
The Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip hop
By Rakim and Short I been inspired
My shit knocks environ---ments
of cats wit seventeen's tint, time is money
The mind is funny, how it's spent on gettin it
It's sittin wit descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is "Money, Cash, Hoes"
I went from bashful to asshole to international
Lover-self, word to the mother on my last record cover it's felt
Now deal wit it

[Chorus: Bilal]

I wanna get into it
Let's do this
I wanna see you move it
So move it
So let's just get into it
Let's do this
Can you feel the music?
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music

[Common]
Yo check it yo
In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, MC's
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell em where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your Horses and ya Carriages, this never-went-gold nigga
Rocks shows care-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affect the lives, the spread of wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had Dreams of Fuckin R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I MC
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say "You changin, Rashid"
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearin everyday, uh-ah
You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dyin
I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI

[Chorus]

[Common]
Yo check it yo
Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans over
Weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posin like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay MC's, just don't come around me wit it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got My Eyes on the Tiger, Eyes on the Prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J. Blige, imagin on how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, invitin you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop Range/range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a Range/range when it's time to head home?

[Chorus x2]

[Common] [during chorus on the second time]
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac
We be that, we be that
Afrodisiac, disiac yeah

Yo.. I don't know what was on y'all niggaz birds(?)
to go up to the boat - and start robbin old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild; yo, check it..

There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin
I'm thinkin, "Who da fuck is this," on the other line screamin
Told em, "Keep(?) down," but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
with some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They had(?) Mag's
and told everybody, "Put your shit in the bag"
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
with they pants hangin off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggaz take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
cause yo, it's the big payback..

[cuts n scratches, Com ad-libs]

[Common]
Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggaz probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)
Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggaz next to me, was talkin bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggaz had a ring
This Hype(?) came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggaz run
It's the big payback..

[cuts n scratches, Com ad-libs]

[Common]
My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin - when shit went down, I was I was there
Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggaz who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky
(like who?) like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet;
he said it was his sister's - I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggaz masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck [gunfire]

[police scanner]
.. three-alarm fire ?? and a possible homicide
The building is entitled "The Ultimate Barbershop"
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead
I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects
I repeat the subjects are at large
we might need some backup..
Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over..
The skit definitely needs more ?? added to it
plus a new writer for the script, thank you..
Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please..


The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammed will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
with cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

[Chorus: Scratched by DJ Premier with variations]

"This is rap for real, something you feel"
"And you know, yes you know"
"Rap for the black people"
"Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy"

In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortilized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

[Chorus]

Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

[Chorus til fade]


Yeah..
Doo-doo-doo, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm..
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo YO..

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

(I'll) take my chances.. before they pass..
.. pass me by, oh darling..
You need to look at the other side..
You'll agree..


Uhh..

Ha, yeah, yeah
Uhh, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, these minimes try to clone us
I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist

Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas livin on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it aint aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fuckin bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talkin 'bout
Yup, stay turnin these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw somethin down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house
Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out...

Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up, just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin, just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, cuz you can feel it in your throat
Say it

I'm 'bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope...
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in wild style
Invitin wack niggas to dinner
I "Trick Daddy" emcees and I don't know, "Nann Nigga"
Who can take it where I take it
You better go into God like Mase did
Leavin crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some ?surface the earth? shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real

Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the ?? stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for ???????
Hurtin like a ?? in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cuz it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Ownin this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept sayin the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, "Off The Wall" wit mines
I'm grabbin my balls when I rhyme, nine nines bustin plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You aint on my mind I'm thinkin 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is somethin like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, cuz really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a pay back


[Vinia Mojica]
[Singing in Spanish]

[Common]
What what, we do this time
Rock rock....
Yes, let this music travel through you
Talk about feelings, yeah yo
Yo wassup world?
Yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin [echoes]
Time travelin *echoes*
Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my god caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touchindown wit God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this

Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, "Rah, give back what you receivin"
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin [fades out] time travelin....

Time travelin [echoes]
Time travelin [echoes]
Yeah, yo wassup world, yo what's happening?
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin [echoes]

Gimme a light a Bud Light, and shit'll get lit just like a cigarette
I'm a b-boy so don't test me, many rappers don't impress me
You try steppin into my city I'll, Snipe em like Wesley
So you best be on your way, I'm doper than Marion Berry, hey
Wake up everyday and make-up rhymes but I'm not Mary Kay
Some say I'm dope as fuck, some label my rhymes incest
My flex is kinda mean yo, so hey kid, CATCH
These nuggets, these nuggets, these nugget ugget uggets
with some peas and a hole in the bucket (cool, cool)
Dear Liza, Minelli, I jam like jelly and I got

I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks
Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks
Now what do niggaz do when they got not food
Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap
So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin
Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin
Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose
I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use
Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account
Not on a blind date, could I see me taken out
by some glutteus, glutteus, maximus, maximus
I'm spas-ta-gis-a-mister-gis a mister-gis-ta-spas-ta-gis
Spectacular, the papes I Count like Dracula
You can't cut the rug, because you suck, MC Vacumn Up
Rappers I skip on like Walter Payton
Their ain't no way or half-step, and flex a rhyme like a bicep
Some steps with concepts, but umm, WHO cares

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, here I come, here I come (what?)
A-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, here I come, here I come (yeah!)
I'm comin around the mountain high as lower than a valley
I'm the cat, from the alley, from the back, I'ma rally
and tally up points, rollin joints, risin to the tops
Somewhat of a playwright, cause like a stage I got props
My crew's a strange brew, a drink a day'll keep the stink away
We been through AA, but hey, what can I say?
Say say say, what you want, but you'll pay the con-se-quences
Cause Mister Common Sense is (yeah)
not gonna take it, so leave you better believe it
Even if your name ain't Ripley, cause Ripley don't know diddley
Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C
Heyyyyyy, but anyway
I hit a skid, and I peel out like MC Eiht, damn I kill it
Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it
Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow
Somebody done stole my beeper but I'ma steal the show
I'm throwin a Heidi Hoe into a bro and tellin her
go for what you know bruh, the people before me go under
Yo we gotta gotta get we gotta get we gotta get
Gotta get, gotta gotta gotta get get over
Somewhere over the rainbow, I'm still the same old same old
Ringin around the collar, borrowin a dollar, check my balls
Dirty drawers, see the kitty suckin titties
Video watchin lush from the city
I'm the extra-terrestrial rappers go home cause they have to
Them marks be callin Ork, come in Ork, Nanu Nanu
The perfect stranger, comin in to a, fuck a new land
Cause Jeffrey where Osborne, and see I'm only human
Doin anything to make a buck, what the fuck I gotta
do what I gotta go [echoes]


Check it
We can go, toe to toe, with the blows to the temple (NOT)
Not the Temple of Doom, so make room
for the Unamerican Caravan (who you down with?)
The B-Boys, Immenslope, Twilite Tone, Derrick and then some
I don't get rid of some faces
while marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases
They have too many cases, and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge
But I got, the story straight
Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep
Slept and got, crept
An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount
Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out
(BOOM) A blackout, power failure
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggaz
Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker
and I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS
And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills
YOU MUST be poppin pills, tryin to step to me
Cause to the left of me, WE got the U-A-C (whattup)
And comin up to the right of me, WE got the U-A-C (come on)
And in back of me, yo WE got the U-A-C
And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G!
We hit em hard!

..

Kick it
A duck tried to buck, but the vic got vicked
so I picked him, he's another victim of a circumstance
He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?)
But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C
Ya see, I ain't out here, tryin to be a bully
Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie
(WORD IS BOND) that I got big balls homes
And if a player try to press me, I gotta break the zone
Here to stage a, OOH SHIT, up in the sky
You better watch out, I'm tellin you why

Yo Common Sense is breaking, marks down

Fuck with me ("you end up the in the cas-ket")
You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard
(Yo Common calm down, you gots to calm down!)
This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down
Lesson number one - when you're ready to throw
never step up talkin - that's like tryin to pitch, but you're balkin
And I'ma steal first, hide the base, but you base
You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE
In case of emergency, it's urgent see, that you see a doctor
You tried to Gamble, but I'm the Proctor
I knock that ass, bringin it down and then slash
Tried to play me with a skit, but now you got a gash
you character, for ya inherit a, neck brace
Makin ya thousand deaths times worser than a Screwface
But they call me Screwneck and I do wreck shit
So next time he push up in the jam, BOY YOU BETTER EXIT

Some be rumpy chump, with the chat chat chitter
Yo we did her but I betcha know I'm better on it
Now you got a 100 percent beef, it's just a beatdown
(UH UH AHH!) Too late to try to be down
Brother your best bet, is to cover your eyes, like Dee Brown
(Cause it's a bum bum bum, bum-rush)
And if I ask who popped shit, the Caravan gotta bus
Sing it ("on that defense")
But our bumrush is well done, not medium rare
It's rare to see, an enemy within play
True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say
Me say, Warriors come out and play
And I'ma tear shit up and leave it like the day, after
And after we go around, and you hit the ground
then you know I'm down with the Blows to the Temple

Walkin up and then down the strip
Lookin for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
that they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm gettin a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
and blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'til my homey asked, "WASSUP WIT DAT?"
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddie, ten-fo'

(Ha hahh, yeahh, ahh break it..)

And I was like, "Everybody wanna wanna rap hard"
Before you wasn't hardcore, so Sonic why ya flipped?
How you gonna hop when you ain't hip?
You found rap, on a two-way street - and lost it
on a parkway, I ain't sayin no names, yo Rico Suave
Fuckin goons fakin stab wounds, I need to shank the crank
Elvis Presley Jr., tryin to be somethin that you ain't
No daps, y'all are hoes, y'all go on stage
and take off all your clothes; then you -- strike a pose
You knows and I knows, that's how you sell your record
Because your shit is BUTT, you gotta get NAKED
But you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me
I said you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me
You got no Soul man, and you need to get a Pound
Cause you, ain't, ah-really down..
.. with true hip-hop you SUCKERS


Whatup BITCH? I'm Petey Wheatstraw
And you don't stop, with the heidi heidi hoe
Hi hoe, or bye hoe, if you're lookin for a sucker
(What are you?) I'm just another motherfucker
Pucker your lips, do flips like Mary Lou
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'ma marry you
Bury you, I will do, after, I bill you
Kill you, hoe, cause your shit smells like mildew
Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag
Or better yet Black, Flag, you scallywag
Tag, I didn't mean to diss dis... hoe butt
But you need to stay such, do not touch
Much disrespect goes out to you
And your parents, too, for havin you
Haven't you been introduced to a douche
I guess you said fuck footloose, and got pussyloose
No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a
Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up
For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off
And have more use, than a public park
for recreation, givin up the body is a hobby
I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it)
Hoe hoe hoe, Merry Christmas
Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis

[Chorus]
Heidi Heidi Hoe, huh, the Heidi Hoe
All the niggaz know, yo the Heidi Hoe, c'mon
The Heidi Hoe, hah the Heidi Hoe
All the niggaz know, that you're a Heidi Hoe

(Now bring it back brotha)

Eni-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-miney-moe
Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger
you can catch a hoe, there's your hoe, kiss a hoe, fuck a hoe
Diss a hoe, I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago
Hablo ingles? I don't know espanol Joe
I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo
Homo's a nono, so faggots, stay solo
I roll my dick so it holds just like a Rolo
Total recall, yeah I see y'all
I see you, I see you're a freak too, so peek a boo
I'm prickin you whether or not, took you out that's work see
So get your skirt see, and bitch, dirty
Curtsey, dosey-do out the do' slut
This is what I come on, so slut you better grow up
Slow up, you forgot your earrings here take em
Salami beef and ham with the asalaam alaikum
Like that hoe (that hoe) that hoe (that hoe)
Dabba-da-dat, it's like that hoe

[Chorus]

Sittin on the dock of the bay, I say hoe
Say hoe?! (Hoe!!) Do you know, do you know?
Bo knows this hoe blows much much dick
An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic
Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat
C'mere k-k-k-k-k-k, yo c'mere you little puddy cat
What, your booty black is so indespicable
You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin jiggaboo
You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here
But first get curlin iron burns off your forehead
My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl
You're fuckin everybody around the way, and been all around the world
And you still can't find yo' fate
But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady
The lady is a tramp snake hoe yo and all of that
Fuck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back
Your black ass bunion
There's a party in your mouth BITCH, and everybody's comin

[Chorus x2]


The rhyme I pick up, trick up, and like hiccup
(Hiccup!) This is a good place for a stickup
So throw your hands in the air and say hell yeah
I Can Beat Mike Tyson, plus I'm Fresh-er than the Prince of Bel Air
And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see
some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma
Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winnin a contest
I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress
I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig
I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig
The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smokin blunts
Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood
They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects
Rockin a Rolex, prefer Wrist Ex instead of Solar Flex
but I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good
The baddest hoes be sayin, "Oooh you're real good"
Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella
Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller
Nail a flammer with the Hammer for comin incorrect
not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner
So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me
Kid just in the nick I kick more ass than Bruce Lee's Nike's did
Just in the nick I kick on the geek stick, flick a Bic
Dick a chick, Slick-er than Rick around the clock I tock to the
tic tac toe, rip up my rhyme my mic's my lasso
Shit, I got rhymes comin out my asshole
I'm in a pole position sole position you're in no position
to be dissin it's a, Rainbow Coalition
I'm kissin ass, goodbye, rockaby, here's your lullaby
like Georgie Puddin Pie but baby baby don't, cry
Feed em I heat em and eat em if I don't need em then I leave em
as leftovers, packin the weak MC's into ?septober?
Til I was older, I couldn't hold a rhyme folder
Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder
If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk
I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be sayin I'm a hunk
Like a duck I'm slammin ham MC's MC's I'm servin
Makin the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!!
Those deserving props are gonna get theirs
Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs
I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape
Tryin to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate
for air you gots it, your best bet is to take an aspirin
I bash it, crash it now you know so stop askin
Cause when you ash I'll make an ass of you and only you see
Just in the nick I kick the funky shit
that's why they call me Bootsy


Hey C.S. man, umm
Yeah since you don't wanna gimme a dollar for no beer umm
why don't you gimme a lyrical shoutout on your album junior?
C'mon man, gimme somethin man!
Common! Ah-heh!
Let's Make a Deal, pickle I'm pitchin penny dimes and nickles
You couldn't sell a sticker, on the tape your DJ tickles
I jiggle and juggle the rhymes like, I was to keep you suckers all
waiting
My tub I rub-a-dub it with my rubber duck I play
with those quack MC's, someone's been sittin in my chair
And I'ma wash that crank right outta my hair
Shampoo but, I'm down with the Nubian Nut, Joe and go for self
You're buggin buddy doin somebody nosin don't know yourself
Peace to Sef and Jeff, Tae ?Deesy Dirty and Don Tanean?
Haste makes waste, so with the case is how my day begins
Hot in quarter vader shops the sports day market pelo
I'm think of my pap, the doctor slapped me in the hostpial with a G-O
Word is bond when I was born, and I took a breath
I never rhyme with busted rhymes and even the blind knew I was def
Respect to Chico ?Waller Al Kadee Roscoe Kalidjusome?
Poo-da, Ba Ba, Luther, the Baby B-Boyz always into some
Time for get me drunk, ?Stu and more my cousin adulay?
Fuck the bitches who dissed us and the hoes who wouldn't give Rash' a play
I'ma play, and which way, until I get my new props
Peace to Ricki Love the rockin shot to all the beer spots
The marks we used to stick up, the posse gets much thicker
To those who I forgot yo I'ma blame it on the liquor
That's my nigga list, to those who I missed
my ass you can kiss I gotta piss


This is a U-A rhyme, dedicate to the ca-nine
Tch-a-ch-tchk, c'mere boy, I said it's play-time
It's time to play with the mind of a slimmie
I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself, and I close it right
in your face, now you wanna taste my food, what?
You got your own food, get a attitude
You get left, call the ref if you think it's foul
I ain't tryin to hear that, so have a Coke and a smile
Cause after awhile, I'ma wanna get BUCKwild
And now months laters, I'ma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin
Little Miss Muffett, that's how the ball bounces
Sorry you gotta bounce the ball eight pounds and two ounces
That's how I'm livin, just like a rottweiler
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder, and settled down with a harem
and when I can't bear em, I share em
You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul
Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball
Brrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin upon the nitty gritty
I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY

..

Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall
in your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very
thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker
Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game
then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally
Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut
and be that I'm a mutt -- so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin
down the street, watchin ladies
Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
a new flower, so Joe can take a shower
and get wet, and then jet
like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear
"Is Common there?" Uh-uh, sorry
you got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend black


[Tim Dog] "Gimme a pound, thank you man"
[repeat x2, then x4 faster]

I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown
Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun
If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground
Cut up in soul soul, by the pound pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down down
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots
Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers
so amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow
Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, "Hell yeah"
Correction, "Hell yes"; old folks wanna cuss
on how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess
But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

Back to our regularly scheduled program, program
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam
like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here...
I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises
to stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers

[Tim Dog] "Gimme a pound, thank you man"
[x4]

For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
and reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
and I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail
and stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid
Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache
I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black
It's like McDonald's sellin fatback
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks
I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer
I'ma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops
I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
but you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours

[Tim Dog] "Gimme a pound, thank you man"
[x4]

It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker
Think of thatI boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta
is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff
it's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff
I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian
I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian
and turn off the lights this is the likes of a
ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
never go pop I'm not a two liter
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow
whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto
Wear em? No, share em? A hoe
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro
cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations
that holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution

"Gimme a pound, thank you man"
"Gimme a pound" [x4]


[Verse One:]

I'm (easy) easy, easy like Sunday morning
I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning
Ahhh, Common's comin with that old oh excuse me
Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a dewe-dewe
Doogie, Howser, cause see I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt, and the
trousers, how's the, Family Ties?
I'm left with the gift, open it up, SUPRISE!
Big bat, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaies and apple pies
And a cup? Nah, that's enough of that
I'm like an indian giver, yo, give me that back
Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector
We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta
Common infector, smug MC, heads up!
Ya better duck cause muck-a-luck, it's me
(Now what's your name) Common
Come in again... Common
(How would you do it) Common
(Now how was she) Common, check it out!
Common is coming soon to a theater near you
To the U-A-C crew, nuff respect due
Do I do, where I do, when I do
I do do do, yo I do it on the ease

[Verse Two:]

I be kickin it with the doubly-dope rhymer
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sli-mer
[Who ya gonna call?] Ghostbuster
I'm pee-wee we stole, and I'm just a
Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec
But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check
So I checked myself, before self got buck
wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a snake, and metriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, cause I'm state
of 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nuthin (hell naw)
The district think I be just a lil trick kid frontin
U Ak got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia
Holy-molia, it's totally awesome
The survey say, I gets moe skins than Richard Dawson
But I won't catch mono or no type of disease
Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease

[Verse Three:]

A lop bop a woo bop, a lop bam boogie
I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper
two-steppin through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!
Oui oui mon cheri, a como tale vouz?
(Contraire mon frere) OK, to the death
Is it true that I'm dope? {Yeahhhh!}
Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo
A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker
I'm shakin-and-bakin-and-takin, cause I'm the back-board
break her arm and feather, whippin the wonder when she activates
Hold up! My jaws are in my crack, (aight) pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the beauty of where I'm in a state
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it
A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone
C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll
Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll
of Khomein, my domain is infinite
Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick
and to the hip-hop shop, the future shock
When we started kickin on the one two, and ya don't stop
But the buck stops here buckaroo
Ya got your instructions, now you know what to do
Take it easy


[Common]
I'm a Jake, I don't bake a cake
I'm not a cake daddy, you know the type be pullin up in a Caddy
with a drop top, see when I hoe hop, I kick it to the bus stop (what?)
and it's goodie goodie gumdrops
I don't be droppin squat but to the heads they think it's topnotch
I'm skippin over every other dip as if it's
hop hop hop hop hop hop hop, hop, hopscotch, watch

Aiy aiyyo man, ay man, look at ol' girl
She got a BIG ass! (Yo man, sic her.)
Aiy man, ay... hey sweetheart, how you doin?
I'm doin fine.
Oh word? What's your name?
Rayshel.
Why don't you come over to the house so I can put you in the
BUCK BANG!

Aight check it, you see I only bag ya for a second
You never see me beggin, you see the slimmie naked
in my headroom, mo' better yet my bedroom
Tippedy tokin, and stutterin as if she's Max Headroom
Redroom (Redrum?) No I ain't a murderer
I'm Jake the Rake, yo sorry if I'm hurtin the
vaginal area, fallopian tubes and your cervix
I strongly recommend that for your gen' you get some Jergens
I find it beneficial; not to force the issue
I just blow my shit and wipe you see a head it's like tissue
Use em and throw em away, see a hoe a day is essential
If you want a piece of the rock, trick, go to Prudential
cause I rock a buyer babe on the treetop
And when the wind blows, my dick'll get hard, the cradle will rock
I'm like the peacock on NBC, Nuttin But Cock
I pump, prrrrrrrrrrrump pump it up yo, like a Reebok
Hey, I don't sell junk, but I'm a Junkyard Dog
And when I Duke it's a Hazzard, so call me Boss Hog
Or Roscoe Pecol, ohhhhh! pain
That's the sound of the Caravan... running the train
yeahhhh yeahh, bitch
That's the sound of the Caravan, running the train
Owwowhwahaheha! Check it out, check it out yeah, in yo' eye!

("Wait... I got another trick up my sleeve")

[Rayshel]
I'm not a Jake or a Rake or a hoe, but I got the mo' better
for head of the class
And if you ask me I'm not tryin ta be drastic
I'm not a bitch like Robin Givens I'm concerned about your
plastic, ask it, I'll tell you what you wanna know
And if I tell you no, don't be all up on it dope
Frontin so your friends won't know that you got the 86
so you call me a bitch
You get your kicks, but Kix and Trix are for kids
I don't turn no tricks, I don't suck no Dix-ie cups
I hops in the hubba Hubba Bubba I'm like
Al B. stud, cause if I'm not your lover or your friend
don't try to spend, waste your time
tryin to get a taste of mine but you ain't tastin mine
So find a new type puss, cause if I don't like you
you ain't gettin service G, this ain't the drivethru
Drive by, way far, and everything'll be groovy
Then you pester me? Yo I'ma tell ya like the Nubians
Move on black brotha move on
You gotta move on black brotha move on

So open wide, and say (AHHHHH)
And I'ma slide my yolk, in your throat, and watch ya choke
on the Uh the Ah the Uh the Daddy Long-Stroke

[Immenslope]
Stroke Long Daddy Money, if my name was Sunny
I'd share a scoop, Runnin shit like Rebels
You can call me Barney, cause I took your Fruity - Pebbles
Dibble like an office on Top Cat, top that, I'm fat troop
Drop the loop, then a scooper hoop ya like a hula
To school a fool I present, a church to repent

I'm all that jazz, and I kick, kick, kick, kick..

[Common]
The razzamatazz oh please oh please just give me just one more blast
I +Gett Off+ like Prince, but I don't have to show my ass
Pass the rest, like a test, if you slip then you'll get ripped
with your handicapped pass route, and Tales From the Crypt
I whip on that ass like base ba-bay
The Sense is good-GOOBELY-goo, ask Gravy

[Immenslope]

Come follow me now (BO! Where's Sue?) I don't know
Even En Vogue, be tellin me ya don't go
When it's time for show (yea) everyone says

cause I never slip, kick it like a Damme Van flip
So don't come with your judo, cause you're just a Menudo
emcee gettin chewed like vegetables

[Common]
Ahhhhh cabbage is a cabbage, a lettuce is a lettuce
I'ma tear this whole joint into scraps
I bust raps, perhaps caps, and trap the wack tracks
Givin the max, for the minimum, not the minimum for the max
Get more sex than Wilt the Stilt so you can call me the Stiltest
You're takin shorts like Arnold, so what chu talkin bout, Willis?

[I] Bout Willis?
[C] Yeah Willis
[I] Willis ain't talkin about nuthin!

[Immenslope]
To keep the hot raw, I'm rollin, rollin
Bowlin - spare me! Fuss ya hushed mouth mush
Lush alcohol's excessive like a Jefferson
Movin on up -- progressive
One time for your brain, cell
And when I get through, you say -- aww hell man!
Styles that I free won't, stop til the end
Paper I go on and go on with the pen
Get a max of funk, attack or sunk *huff, huff*
One blow, and emcees are gone with the wind
Kickin the dumber rhyme, I'm not a print
but I'm fresh, heatin up like the summertime, summer rhyme
I'm a dime a dozen, but I keep you buzzin
like a bee, a dozen attempts is in the toilet
Cause I flush the dime and I'm not a Leader
cause I Busta Rhyme, a rhyme
If I kick with Rakim, you +Run For Cover+ brother
But I kick it with Petey cause I'm just another mother (sucker)
Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time)
It's Blo Pop time (it's Blo Pop time)
In the mix, the dimension, J.B., and Chico
It's seven, not six, my shirt extra-large

Then it's, time to let you know

Live from the South Side this one
Hide your gun, representing Chi-Town to the fullest
Raps or bullets, see them rappers, they be duckin'
When Com be buckin' in the kitchen, fuckin'

On the sink, got my mama a mink
Think Common is the link, thought the game was extinct
Lay there, them jeans is as slim as Shady
Brought 'em back from the 80's, now let's make some babies

Freestyle paid off so Lincoln paid me
No we can push more whips than slavery
Alex Haley and this rap shit, my roots is deep
You heard the bitch is you, yeah I know what's beef

You thirsty niggas can't stop my feast, uh

Valet crushed my Rolls so quickly I bought another
Sorry Mr. William moved out the building
Spot to the top, fifty feet with was the ceiling

Slow down son, you're killin' 'em, well funded it was not
Came to shitty deals, reminiscing give me chills
When Puff was with Biggie, Versace on every niggie
The backpacker copped the Porsche and drove to his city

Now all the little bitties from ugly to pretty
I was the magician mesmerize 'em, made 'em listen
My dick is like a Blow Pop baby
And it gets stiffer than some Botox baby

But show out baby and show me you ain't gon' act right
And I'll be pedaling backwards like a track bike
She ain't know the Casio cost a hundred
It's been two years since I done it, now all the rappers want it, what?

Everybody I'd like to announce
Throw you hands up when we in the house

Unzip the backpack, pull out a fifth of Jack

The black Kojak, I get money and want mo' stacks
The rap photographer, the way the flow stop
Broads say, "Are you a philosopher?"
"Yeah yeah, I philosophize on top of ya" Uh!

[Verse 1 - Common]
I'm the river, that flow to the hood,
To the woods, to the birds, to the mud, to the bricks over the curves 
To the force bizarrs got with 4 acres in the worst to worst 
Planted chrome for the young seeds to know 
Trees is blowin, we see changes in the wind 
This is new day and I gotta take it in 
See a black man run, we need him to win 
Young I search search for a better tomorrow 
Let the belief leave away and the angels hallo 
Open doors for a hope for to go to 
Cause I would chose so and I supposed to 

[Muhsinah - Chorus 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

[Verse 2 - Common]
I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child 
I always smile, let my mind float like a child 
Wishin I was smart as these kids are now 
All grown ups still wishin I'm a child again 
Church saw remaind me to stay grateful 
A more y remaind me to stay playful 
Day's go by, my life all high 
I leave all my walks so the fight don't die 
And me, I found a purpose, why I'm MC 
It's vital young world to be greated than me 
I follow wake and the dream as song 
So the little shorty's can sing along 

[Chorus: 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

[Verse 3 - Common]
Welcome children, welcome me 
Your's sentimentces felt in me 
I see the future and the walking path 
Don't let these fool take you off your path 
Laugh if you need to, smile if you need to 
Life is a trip while a long and proceed to 
Try to believe to, do what you wanna do 
Remember your're kings and queens and still humble to 
Life is a funny you no need to look back again 
Victory can be claim while you still battleing 
Drive along with a food I provide you 
To awake and the voice that's inside you 

[Chorus: 2X]
I know that change come come 
The race begun, where all most stare oh yeah 

Changes is in arable, you can stop it 
Changes happening and everybody is like 
Changes is like the furious hurricane, that you can't stop 
What is change? change is Martin Luther King jr, Ghandi, 
Shakespeare, Tupac Shakur, Barack Obama 
And you can't forget Common 
Changes gone happen 
Change is hope.


[Chorus]
How did you know I been waiting for this time to come
And though it tastes like for ever it may not stay longâ¦
Everywhere itâs summer [repeat 4X]

[Verse 1]
A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition:
I give you, you listen
Im syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no 3rd return
Im planning intention
With love the redemption

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into you mind away we rock
In a rocket is the 87th astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin
It was outa control
Strap into your mind 
Why eyes see some recline
Youâll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MCâs are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on, to space beyond
You gon get there by doin what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we trip to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outa my dome
now I know, it all Iâve known

[Chorus]


Nothing-nothing-nothing-nothing 

[Chorus] 
Nothing you could do [x4]

[Intro] 
They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game 
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain 
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same 
Are you not entertained 
So all the onlookers and the bystanders 
Wait til intermission, run buy your camera 
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum 
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium 

[Verse 1] 
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart 
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark 
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights 
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice 
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared 
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered 
Vroof, vroof vroof vroof vroof Vroof vroof well 
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele 
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail 
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L 
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale 
Still touched down cause I was off Artell 
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail 
Took the underground rail to the end that failed 
I rebel, NYSL 
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela 

[Chorus] 

[Common] 
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield 
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill 
A legend like Will Smith with the steel 
I could save the world when shit get for real 
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill 
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel 
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel 
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will 
My drive VROOM is how I stay the livest 
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid 
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids 
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage 
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest 
Any moment opponents drop out like college 
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust 
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up 

[Chorus] 

[Common] 
Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt 
Scars over bars, symbols of the work 
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama 
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta 
So don't violate or you'll get violated 
Some of you model bitches is so overrated 
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it 
In the water I waded on the corner I painted 
Draw blood like we related 
MCs get de-decapitated 
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with 
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick 
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs 
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs 
These are the words of a radical 
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud 
To be the gladiator 

[Chorus]


[scratches] Inhale 

I breathe deep 
Like an old man in a deep sleep 
Or an Indian peace pipe 
Identity be 
The beginning, the end, the first, the last 
Breathe into infinity 
A verse that lasts 
Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast 
When there was a drought then her thirst would last

The hunger of a homeless 
Microphonus 
Played the game - it got a bonus 
Man is the plan 
The master like Tiger 
So much is the drive 
I am the definition of a rider 
Daughter's name means survivor 
From a tribe-a 
Colliders 
Just one word can't describe her 
A scribe of the streets 
And a good life that we all wanna reach 
I'm hotter than a beach 
Flow is so deep 
Even underwater 
I can inhale to bring the world in order 

[scratches] Inhale


Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

(ohhh oh oh) see her on the beach she was wrappped in a towel 
Her bodys going down see her ass crack to smile 
Enjoying the nile (woo) take it the breeze 
Or some cat a mouse 
And she was the cheese on the sun keys 
Yeah on a conversation 
California dreamin now california-cation 
Said she had drinks in the coller and I had an inventation if I wanted I could brewer this is just an invdication on 
How cool she was 
A couple of chicks came 
Groupie love 
They aint want no pictures 
Im think damn damn thats really cool because sometimes I wannta chill sometimes the best things in life are not even planned 
Came to the sand and got more than a tan 
Baby girl im a man 
And we can do this my way 
Take a ride on the highway and pretend that its friday 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

(ohhh) she was at a bar-b-que 
Pretty painted nails she took off her shoes 
Grammer school 
Sippin on some l thinking man shes cool 
Sun smiling on her hair 
Playing spades and we can be a pair 
I love it when its sunny girl 
You could be my Cher
Inderpendence day and freedoms in the air 
Dance and danced away yo 
Showing steppin like a tango 
Like me, got me 
Sweet as icy spicy 
Drip from my lips 
We can do something hip 
Trip around the world in a day 
Play phonia a 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day 
Yeah she really makes my day 
Ohhh oh oh 

Ahh the sun is shining brighter cause you really make my day 
You really make my day 
Ohhh oh oh 
Yeah I think I like her cause she really makes my day

What do you see when look at me and Iâm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work thatâs what in my blood
And I wonât stop until I drop, cause my lifeâs just burning our
So walk keep climbing wonât look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, âAye boy just go schoolâ
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules

What do you see when look at me and Iâm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work thatâs what in my blood
And I wonât stop until I drop, cause my lifeâs just burning our
So walk keep climbing wonât look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

Now his whole life he told his boys, âHey yall Iâm going to rapâ
So when he got a rap contract, it wasnât no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him. âYou need to get get back in schoolâ
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using it for fuel

What do you see when look at me and Iâm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work thatâs what in my blood
And I wonât stop until I drop, cause my lifeâs just burning our
So walk keep climbing wonât look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

And the story goes on and on it goes on and on and on
They say, â Hey boy you rap real good, but ainât making no good songsâ
So he âd tell him self yo yo yo self you gotta do it the way you do
And make this musing from your soul and make it fresh and new

What do you see when look at me and Iâm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work thatâs what in my blood
And I wonât stop until I drop, cause my lifeâs just burning our
So walk keep climbing wonât look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]

Then the fame it started to change, They say music just ainât the same
Though he remained the song he is sang keep your drive stay in your lane
Inch by inch people ccame the started to know his name and say you do your thang
Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star it born

What do you see when look at me and Iâm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work thatâs what in my blood
And I wonât stop until I drop, cause my lifeâs just burning our
So walk keep climbing wonât look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world [4x]


[Common's answering machine beeps]
Say brotha
If you ever let me leave out a club
with a big fat ass, stove-like bitch
like that without point out the facts,
I'ma kick your motherfuckin ass.
Man that nerve of the hoe not to give me no pussy.
Come up in my house tryin to watch movies and shit.
This ain't no motherfuckin cinema, BITCH!
Who the fuck she thought I...
Say brotha, I wasted a evening
I shoulda went witcha, but ohh well
You know I gets my pussy anyway, you know
That's how playaz do
But gahd-damnit Rashan
That big ass bitch *cracks up*
If you'da said to spread on that hoe
Man I could kick my own ass
Well, should go to work
Just another wasted nite
And ohhhh, ohhhh
Heyyy, heyyy, what can you say


I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time
Out my day
To pray and I say
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep
My soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old
And it's a cold cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma
It's the same routine
Keep my room clean
I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two - catch
In the prime of my life
I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel
Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness
Aiight you sing, I may not be the darkest
Brotha
But I was always told to act my age and not my color
Knowin' that my color was that of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up...etc.
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance
From all angles
I tangle
For cash
Hopin' it'll last
'Til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the arab
And on the way back
I stop and the liquor store
Grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop
And I can't turn around
Brew - I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up
My liver I burn it up (Fat line)
It's my life I live it up
The cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day
Three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin - how come
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin
But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive
But I disintegrated
To a state that's stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated
or blowed
Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my concentration
In this idiotic nation
They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience
Adjacent
To that situation
I want an occupation
That I'm into
'Cause yet if I begin to
Live to my potential
I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish
I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just sunshine
But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happpy until I rest
In peace
Of mind
And find
Who I am
But thank God I found you


[Intro whispering:]
Let's talk about money
Get money
Common Sense want the money
Let's talk about money.

[Common Sense:]
I... be... the one they call Peavey
I'm Poe, as Edgar Allen
But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin

[Ynot:]
You got a design, masterwind, Not Never The Less
Fresh like L, addresss, yes the LS's here
I appear on piers with my peers
The Imperial like margerin, I'm butter
Yes like Bel-Air

[Common Sense:]
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some perculator
I circulate around the block
Black to get me a six pack a half of Harrold's chicken
A good combination, when I get bubbly I do it in moderation
1 brew, 1 brew, I said 1 brew at a time

[Ynot:]
Well I'm a two timer of women that'll 3 times a lady
Ms. Haiti say Sade and my Ms.Golper say
"Yo whoop there it is" call me E cause I equal MC's squared
In the bed marks know I got the key to get the girls
Noses open like the vapors, more pub than the papers
More papers than the press, oh yes I gets paid

[Common Sense:]
Yo, I didn't grow up up po po but once you get grown and out on your own
Bills apon bills apon bills is what you have
Before you get your check than you already spend half
See I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and section 8

[Ynot:]
Enough, I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
Where I have them comin' in (ugh) 8 seconds
I told Victoria her Secret you suck life a crest
I Ultrawhite my secretery, I went to Tibet
To bet on a horse you bet your life
Mine was better and now your deader, than a (door knob) eeea wrong

[Hook:]

[Ynot:]
So what's your name?
[Common Sense:]
I'm the Com that wrote Com Sense, and when I don't got scratch
I do feel tense, and if you give your money to a broad yous a dummy
[Ynot:]
Cause without the money
"Ain't a damn thing funny" [x3]

[Ynot:]
THese rhymes I exchange like stock, I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential, making ha ha from O
That's mucho denero, like Robert Denero, Irob Berts denero
A hero like the sandwich, a man which has mills like Stephanie Mills
Dills like pickels, I'm fancy man like tickles LIKE (the french)
Not Johnny but like a Bench I press on like glue
I stand like Lee while you stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll gagger that bullish I pull ish like a magnet
A dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income, yo bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush will get mushed like a sleigh dog
I saw dogs who are under me, I over man, call me Doverman
Cause I'm a Pincer of pennies that's pretty, then you see green from all money
I spend (what you do?) I stay fresh like mint from mint
I ment my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim but like Homer I got attention salute
I kill loot but won't dilute, even if I threw garbage on the ground
I couldn't pollute, man, I'm too rich for that, Biiitch

[Hook:]

[Common Sense:]
So what's your name?
[Ynot:]
I'm Ynot I own a mansion and a yacht (uh ha)
Essentials and credentials and honies at my feet (come on)
And when I walk the street I'm never looking bummy
[Common Sense:]
Cause without the money
"Ain't a damn thing funny"

[Comm:]
Ok there was a black man a white man and a chinnese man
The black man of coarse he was po (yeah)
THe white man. He was rich (uh ha)
And the chinnese man, he owned a store (alright c'mon)
Ok the blackman lived on Beech Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And the chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Because the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit he didn't have to wear it (uh ha)
He scratched that pad he got from his parents, with his tight ass
He would of been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the blackman would ask for some spare change
But Adam, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The chinnese man got noyd and broke out like a peon
And now the blackman own the store and the name of it is Leons
(what's that?)
Barbeque that is. Rib tips hotsuace, mild sauce, fries


[Intro:]
Yo Troy I'ma come on the rhythm
with a little bit of Communism
Yeah, hah
So check it out, yeah
Chick-a chick-a I'm
Chick-a chick-a on
Chick-a chick-a my
my, own shit
Like an entrepeneur, that stepped in maneur
man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill
And Jack chills big bootay
But then the booty up, I told the bitch she better have my money
Or step to the AMG
You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be
That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds
But since then, Common calm down!
I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
on my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees
It's the ninties, and music got known for grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Come past MC's with compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort
Commiserate at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com can get the panty, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
but to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
my compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
without the elements, compelling sense into Communism


[Verse One:]
I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
ont he regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
and just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone, wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her

[Verse Two:]
Now periodically I would see
ol girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick
DId a couple of videos and became afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
in a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style
She said, afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell, by how her titties hung

[Verse Three:]
I might've failed to mention that the shit was creative
But once the man got you well he altered the native
Told her if she got an energetic gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it
That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop


("Yeah yeah, now check the method" - Extra P from ATCQ's "Keep It Rollin")
[cut and scratched x4 by Mista Sinister]

[Verse One: No I.D.]
No time to get all excited, just write it
from the inside let the pen slide, and spread
the ink on the papyrus, come understand this (what?)
Paint the canvas, givin you my vision
To mold you, compose you
Get a picture of the scene, then get an exposure
Words out my cipher, the life of my circle
Train tracks aside of me, Cabrini to Idabi, don't lie to me
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain till I'm out of your system
Be digger not a nigger or a niggerole I figure you're
the winner of the bread, precede your thoughts
'fore they come into your head (yo kid kinda nice!)
From the word, I speak, unique, clear and concise
Heads I'm boring, soaring to a new height of flight
And then fight the night
With a light to gain sight make your competition say AIGHT
No I.D. from the city with a bridge on thirty-first
Makin all butt crews disperse

[Chorus: x4]
[No I.D.] I'm in my own world ("Yeah yeah, now check the method")

[Verse Two: Common]
[No I.D.] ("Check the method")
I'm in my own world
I say pay attention boy, I say UHH looka here
I want you to see me when you do you look and fear
I dilate pupils it's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
CHEAP ASS NIGGAZ! Go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
my style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon be like
"I can't believe it! I got shot!"
Bowe/bo so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Sekendall
I remember me and Deion tried to get into Mendal
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin me to get them in
I be like, "You don't know me... fool"
And color it purple, cause he ain't in my circle
Now I'm talkin square biz to you and I'm out
I'm in my own world


[Intro:]
Gotta watch out for them critters
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live huh [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I was born in Chicago raised on Planet Rock talking zsa zsa zsa zsa,
Catch knock my tape like beats (uh), I'm fresh as fruits,
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent
You burn up you got me bit, I'm coming as ebit
Got on big hoes at Freaknit, frequently your telling me
Won and worn your rockets, so, he ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo heard, with my head I cock it, and rock it like that brother in
Colors
Cause I want y'all to live, my crew is 2 Live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (what?) it's just another case of that 2 dollar MC
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight to you they wrinkled but to my they straight
Now I'm straight are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it jack, and now I'm out of here

[Hook:]
"Maintain the rock"
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh "Don't stop the rock" [X4]

[Verse 2:]
I need me some new socks, I need me some new drawers
I draws attention, like a letter to a sargent
Theres A Few Good MC's the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I got nobody but when they see me at the party they be like
"Go head, go head", cause I gots the cuts like Bobby, rappers are dickheads
Choppin' they demo, I do it like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5, while you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn
Charles Jug and Wesly Snipes, marks wanna test me because I test the mics
I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down
Plus I done got better since Soul By the Pound, I maintain

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3:]
I fall fresh apon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming
And house more hoes then Spellman, worse unwelcome like James Johnston
My brains sponcering speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondaling, they try to settle out of court
But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought
Cause I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin
And I got juice, and this niggas scared
I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for broke like Mel for Moore
Why should a male with a B8 get more then me?
When Rashid got an MC degree, and a doctorine in rockin' shit I go to docs to get
A fishwish with cheese, I don't mix with MCs, cause I just don't like the mother____
But I'm still maintaining

[Hook]


[Intro:]
Check it on the one, you Com is gonna come [x3]
And check it out, ha.

[Verse 1:]
My raps do laps around tracks to the days
The idiot vibin', I'm the comma comma Chamelion
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray
It had maxed, I was with bitches that had coochie
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed their figures
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one
We come to the get together with whatever
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to
The next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicage and Fun Town and shorties we run round
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair
I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our
liquior
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure

[Hook:]
I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but ah,
"Niggas be rollin'" - Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a hoe while I
"Niggas be rollin'"
Gotta make a stop take a leak and get some chops cause um
"Niggas be rollin'"
We gonna hit the streets for some brew and some eats cause um
"Niggas be rollin'"

[Verse 2:]
I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get "Find a body!"
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division
(I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tonemaster
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool
I thought I was cool, with my "members only" and a bold fade
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot

[Hook]


Hand me a little bit of umm, orange pineapple juice
I'ma sip on it, check it out
I got a rhyme, you got a rhyme
But my rhyme is better than yours
[x2]
U-A-C, they get they P's and
No I.D., be gettin his P's and
The Late Show, they get they P's and
ProfessaNots, they get they P's and
Peep the maneuver, how bout the Heim-lich
I rhyme sick and you can get the duck, coon
I'm the shit, you're shit out of luck, tough
I'm the act to follow, housing kids like Ronald
Mac like Donald Goines, flows I change like coins
Choyoyoyyoyoyyng, choyoyoyyyyng, choyoyoyoyyyyyng
I draw a crowd like blood with the 'pint of' technique
and everybody there be like, "YEAH!"
Cause cain't near a nig dat'll say 'Whoomp, There It Is'
I'm like a mom on section 8, over-bearing kids
shit they be like, "Com-mon!" That's my muhfucka true
Youse a hamburger, I'ma Fudrucker
askin me to lettuce ketchup, knowin you can't cut the mustard
So where's the beef, jerky?
I'm as Worthy as James, not that good with names
but I do remember your face from someplace this is one taste
of Chicago, we got mo' many mo' many mo' many mo' flavors
Don't just come to me, go ask thy neighbor-I'm-a-hood takin niggaz under
on the tundra, cause "they're plain, they're plain" (Fantasy Island)
I'm on a plateau that is fat so
It's just a fan-tasy, for the fans to see
how I land, I'm grand like a finale
I'm goin back to Cali (why?) cause Cali got bitches check it
Aiyyo Dart this is a sickness
Dee-da-da-da-doo-doo, dee-da-da, ah-eh-da-da
Dee-da-da-da-DOO-doo, dee-da-da, dee-da-da
South Side, rock on and
The West Side, we gotta rock on and
Hey yo Chicago, we gotta rock on and
The East coast, you gotta rock on and
The West coast, you gotta rock on and
ah down South, you gotta rock on and
Check it... "Now you can go!"
Mister Pussy Emcee, just get on gone
Get on gone, you pussy MC!
Steppin to me, with them dirty feet you'll get defeated
like Kunta Kinte, I'm kin to, align crew
My great, great, grandpap done been through
so much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'ma Turn This Mutha Out
But Common you ain't hittin in New York
I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, "Why your titties saggin?"
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like pessimist
Ring the Alarm, I got Charm like a neck-a-lace
Tell me true statues had to move they neck to this
Didn't you, didn't you... and it, and it, and it
and it don't stop, bust it
[Keith Murray] "Gotta crew ya better tell em"


[Verse One:]
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin
Over the globe will my vocals be travellin
Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin
Grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads
I wish that Madelline, was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin everything I'm readin
But my brain was bleedin, needin feedin, and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's Crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I unswine
Eatin beef sometimes I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A misdemeanor fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished since, cause I was guilty in a sense

[Verse Two:]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
Imaginations in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights
And in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like
I spend nights up in dykes
In spite I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums
Hooked on negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggaz
Now my speech is lost quicker
Cruisin Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker
U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker
U Ak got my back and we don't now check it
I'm a hoe but not a hoe nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm


Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's "Tonight's Da Night"
An eye for an eye, a life for his wife
Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith
Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles
Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't

Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me "Never", they be like "Never's going to get it"
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look
Rest in peace to Heavena, washing tons of rappers like Booker
Tee told me "You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world"
How you going to come off with the style that's thourough?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on

My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline
Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on


[KRS-One] "I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me"
[repeat x2, then x2 with 'Common' at the end of each line]
Check it out
Good morning... be at calm, I'm back
HUH! It's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
[attempt at whistling] Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
and picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
to waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
to an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read
then buy from me
I got the flame like U-I-C but I be, U-A-C
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
in your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dickses
not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with pros
hoes who wheeze, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers and rollers
Players with plat studs with stocking caps I be rocking raps
til I collapse
Niggaz play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I celo, I see high
Hi C, I'm free at last
I'ma free man, free as the world be
and like an early bird, I'm special
But you ain't that special, as that investor
So to myself I say congratulations
I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience
Cause thisisme
[KRS-One] "I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me"
Common!
[x3]
Whassup Scony Rony I'm that boney homey
from Stoney (Common) you know me!
Off the GP niggaz see me on the TV
Talkin Take It EZ, and they was like "He ain't hardcore!"
But hardcore is far more than bats and gats
It stems back to the roots of being true
It's gonna get me Me, you just get you You
What I look like, talkin about some shit I ain't do?
I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody
I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was THEM!
The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to show no gun
It takes one to know one, and no one can tell me
how to be, cause I'ma be me, aight?
Cause I'm a man, now check it
[KRS-One] "I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me"
Common!
[x3]
[singing] Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!
When I'm chillin at the flat, lookin at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit
on the mic I be talkin shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm tryin to make the Dollars, my momma told me
to go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm comin out of nowhere, to go where
probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark/arc, on the shot
but now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love call me love
cause love is gonna getcha I'ma getcha
I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West, all across the country
I'm like that big fat one niggaz catch when bumpin
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love!!!
I love good music, I love my momma
I love myself, I love you, and you love me
And thisis -- I'm out
(KRS sample plays in background)
Yo I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmomma
Lil Chandra, and John, yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella
My sides moms, Ron's moms, Dawn's moms, Corey's moms
Who are you? These people be themselves y'all, peace em out
Common! [x4]
[KRS sample is cut and scratched to end]


I express like an interstate
Hyper when I venilate
My rap pieces penetate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reitterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I speand a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six thousand ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
My stutter styles crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when i wreck other rappers be like whiplash!
Verse Two:
It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance
It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause i had lyrics back when i used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like "What's up?"
I said, "You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, "You know you done fucked up"
Everybody that here be say I'm Jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelan I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say "True"
They be you and be like fiction
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro
I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo'
Just chillin
Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace
I'm out to Dirty Burgers I'ma give my change to Reese


[Common]
Yeah!

Yeah!

[Common]
Nigga deep in the rhythm, experience speak
Some keepin' the wisdom, the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em, i'm dope the streets need me to hit em
With some of that (revolutionary rap)
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
Im getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building im the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game aint only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You aint supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine
In the age of aquaruis...

[Chorus]
[Singing]
The water that arrives (ba-ba ba ba)
To purify the world (du-ba ba ba)
Flying through the night (du ba-ba ba ba)
So watch out here he comes (du-du ba ba ba)
Aquarius! [echoes]

[Common]
Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of feinds, I flow over water thats as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be greatful like the chruch psalm my grandmother sings
Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first
We in the age of aquarius...

[Chorus x2]

Aquarius! [x2]


[First Verse]
She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We laid under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you [echo]

[Chorus - Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me

[Second Verse]
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't conceive her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors theres no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the Creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you [echo]

[Chorus]

[Third Verse]
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you [echo]

[Chorus]

Liberation...
Peace


[Intro]
[Common:] It's just a fly love song, what
[Mary J:] Mmmmm
[Common:] It's just a fly love song, what

[Verse: Common]
Are we living in a dream world?
Are your eyes still green girl?
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy, we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile, happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you 

[Verse: Common]
Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard in you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
The pimp in me 
May have to die with you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know what you're thinking, you're on my mind
You're right, you're right, you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired, tonight, tonight

[Verse: Common]
You help me to discover me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny to we connected girl
You and i we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

[Chorus]

[Bridge (2x)]


[Common]
Yo!

[Chorus (x8)]
Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!

[Common]
Blood and magic dripping from me
True thugs and addicts I grip an entry
Enter this game with tricks and envy
I forget game to remain an emcee
Rooms in this mind that's still empty, only fulfilled through prophecy
You stoppin me, you see I'm trying to catch this plane
You must be slow nigga, catch your brain
It's fresh, but it is some stress and pain
Got hos?, Ho nigga respect the game
I talked to cab drivers about the fast lane
And Islam, masters and shakras? and beyond
Think about the hustle and somehow I see by
But what led it to the concrete, BS be strong
You was at your hardest when you didn't even try
Live like a bitch, to bitch you gonna die

[Chorus (x4)]
Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!

[Common]
Mercury and retrograde, I'm trying to get niggas in the ghetto paid
While they watch pornos and Escalades, away from floats and the dope in sex parades
Somebody screaming in my mind, I'm trying to find if it's me
Or voices on the master, they desgin to be free
Same revolt, can't be found on TV, or radio, its living in me
Hey lady, that smoke is bothering me
If I put it in your eye, ashes you would cry
All this rap talk is blowing my high
I just came to chill and build with my guy
I try to walk but I stumble off the humble path
This story of a pimp stick that became a staff
You got it, you gotta know where to aim the Mag
Art and opinions are made to clash

[Chorus (x4)]
Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!

[Common]
Out of body hard to explain, like the pyramids and gods I remain
I know pain, like Kurt Cobain, or A.I. [Allen Iverson] playing hurt the whole game
Dig it to the Earth's brain for worst gain
Focused like young blood on his first chain
I used to write shit to please niggas
Now I write shit to freeze niggas
Whether iced out, or American Pie sliced out
I sit in the room with the lights out
Whether diced out, or with their hair spliced out
I sit alone in the room with the lights out screaming

[Chorus (x8)]
Electric! Wire! Hustle! Flower!


[Chorus: Jill Scott]
Can you speak your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most of believing the magician
But you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I (I)
I (oh I)
I
Appreciate what you give to me
Yeah (I)
I (oh I)
I
Appreciate what you give to me

[Verse 1: Common]
People say I got soul look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement, your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, so cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap for them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Peep the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks wax CDs and tapes
I am music

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to hear me
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot you can't stop my heat
I taught J and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time yo beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times yo at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when your ride is smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pops collections
Whether whole or half stepping I'm a blessing
Yo I am music

[Chorus 2X]


[Common]
Yeah! Hah! Yeah, we got, come on
Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude
Pass the booze, and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted
Yo I'm tokin on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be tokin in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleedin
Had to meet with my mind and ? to be defined and
Stay on my climb
I'm grind - ing, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neu - tral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

[Chorus (x2)]
I want to ride in my car, smoke my weed
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel hood
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel hood
I got the right to feel high

[Common]
I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop
Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gonna get that kick-a-box
Make sure that ? not
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changin, y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane

[Chorus]

[Common]
Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweeking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbin through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo

[Chorus]


Yeah! The war zone.  Who you fighting for?

[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
they could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a....
rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!

[Chorus: Laetitia Sadier]
All traces of life
in our gats we carry
that's used to dress humanity
([Common:] it's a New Wave, Come on!)

[Sung in French]
All traces of life
in our gats we carry
that's used to dress humanity
([Common:] it's a New Wave, Dig it!)

[Sung in French]
This life is precious
it's goddamn? marvelous
before it ever ends
([Common:] it's a New Wave, Come on!)

This life is precious
it's goddamn? marvelous
before it ever ends
([Common:] Come on! Come on!)

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
for the people to make or wait it's better
in a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like (?) umbrella
where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green "Let's Stay Together"
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Ya'll rich, we could beef curry in the game
out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go BANG
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
and look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
that master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave- people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
and tell them that they're pharoh so let go
Come on!

[Chorus]


[Intro]
Yeah, for the world!
Keep going so you can(yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going

[Verse 1]
Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law cant arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See thru trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed thru the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap

[Verse 2]
Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit thru gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power


Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone? Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on.  That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you

Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca

Wish on star 69, erotica...

So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life: I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you

Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca

Slave to your loneliness
"Slave to your loneliness..."
Inside of loneliness
"Inside this (alt we bear)"
With love of loneliness
"With thoughts of loneliness"
Enslaved by loneliness

I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes...

Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca
[repeats and fades out]


[Common]
My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle

[Chorus]
[Common]
Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
[Common] Just move, and shake, and grind and hustle
It's on your mind so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that

[Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

[Chorus]

[DJ Joe Sinista scratches bridge]
"Can't knock the hustle!" "The Hustle!" "I'm in"
"Im in" "I'm in too deep" "deep to sleep!" "Can't knock the hustle!"
"The hustle!" "Caught up in the hustle!" "I'm gettin' high"
"Can't knock the hustle!" "The Hustle!" "I'm in"
"Im in" "I'm in too deep" "deep to sleep!" "Can't knock the hustle!"
"The hustle!" "Gotta hustle up!" "I got to have it, have it...have it" [echos out]

[Common]
Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sow clothes
Some hobo at the junction inbetween cars
Some enter in functions inbetween stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against me odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin El Derado's bumpin' El DeBarge
Whatever the dreams, stay on ya deem the world is ours, its the hustle

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[DJ Joe Sinista]
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hustle up!" "Stay hustlin'!"
"Gotta hus-" "hustle up!"
"Stay hustlin' hustlin' hustlin'!"
[echoes out]


I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcom, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death-grew conception
New breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in her direction
In the right way
Told inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights stay, stay on the mind
But I write many lives and lay on these lines
Wave the signs of the times
Many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise
I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize that I'm gonna learn through her
The Messiah, might even return through her
If I'm gonna do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, gramps wanting 'em
Demons and old friends, pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
When drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back or too far in front of me
The present is a gift
and I just wanna be


[Chorus]
[Common sample] And you say Chi city
We don't stop naw we don't quit
[Repeat 4X]

[Common]
I rap with the passion of Christ, @#%$ cross me
Took it outta space and @#%$ thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiropract wit b-boy survival rap
This ain't '94 Joe we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired, I'ma take over
Tell these halftime @#%$ break's over
I'm raw hustlas getcha bakin' soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and their faith over
It's a war goin' on you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement listenin' to tapes of Ultramagnetic to the fact the Messiah's black
I turn the TV down we could take it higher than that
I wonder if these wack @#%$ realize they wack
And they the reason my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christian
Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, c'mon

[Chorus]

A black figure, in the middle of chaos and gun fire
So many raps about rims, I'm surprised @#%$ ain't become tires
On the street you turn code and then go screech
I tell em @#%$ em, like I do the police
The beast in runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryna have sex that's tantric
But the getto, tryna make a get up stand up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich
I slap a @#%$ like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We poli hood stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved in Run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm hotta than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip hop is goin', a Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city y'all, the city, the city y'all
C'mon

[Chorus]


[sample] Faithful to thee
[Common] We got to be
[sample] Faithful to thee
[Common] I want to be
[sample] Faithful to thee
[Common] Yes, its for the people, God moves, yeah

[Verse 1]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same?  Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

[Chorus]
[sample] Faithful to the end
[sample] Faithful to the end
[sample] Faithful to the end
[sample] I'd like to be her very best friend

[Verse 2]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, "Why do men always have to stray?"
He said, "I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet"
"I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'"
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, "I'm tryin' to get my life together"
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
"Baby you a blessin' and my best friend"

[Chorus]

[Bilal with his voice overlapping] Faithful to thee
[Bilal] Faithful to thee
[John Legend singing]
[John Legend & Bilal] I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful
[John Legend & Bilal] I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be so faithful

[Verse 1]
Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Tripping on heights, wishing for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay
A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
So many niggaz, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good working with my hands
My generation never understood working for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot, as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

[Chorus Repeated Overlapping:]
"It's your world"

[Common] Yeah

[Verse 2]
Life and death law around us
Four pounds and pounds a verb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, thats why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl selling her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, looking in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growing up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was ike, so her mother he striked
she got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doing white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jefferson's y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rooting for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

[Chorus repeated several times]

[Kids stating their dreams]

['POPS']
Be, be here, be there, be that, be this
Be grateful for life, be grateful to life
Be gleeful everyday, for being the best swimmer among 500,000
Be-nign, be you, be mom's mean pie, be little black sambo With bad hair
Be aware of what a lynch is, Be, be boundless energy
Be a four star ghetto general, be no one except I
Be a strong academic student, be an A student in sociology
Be food for thought to the growing mind, be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited, be long-living, be forgiving, be not forgetful
Be a proud run, only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible, but justice in ways (?)
Be high when you low, be on time but knowing to go
Be cautious of the road to college, taking a detour through Vietnam or the middle east
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while begging
A nation built on free labor for reparation, Be a cartopogropher
Be a map maker, be able to find afro-american man
search thoroughly it may be close to black man
Be ammended 5/5ths, be ammended 5/5ths human
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid, to world government
Be found among the truth, lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as tender 18 of the mountain tops
Be a brilliant soul, sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Ghandi and Martin Luther King
Be that last one of 144,000, be the resident of that twelfth house
Be....eternal!


Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggaz express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At time it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end
Yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hopin' it would come one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man
Uh

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always
Yeah

[Chorus]


[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do

[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
Whatchu expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggaz hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggaz lives
Like UPN
It's real people

Yeah.
For you and yours
Good music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh.. Yeah
Yeah, yeah
The real...


[Common:]
She walked in the court her knees buckled
Saying "For a man to survive he need hustle"
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his hoe to his wife
Stifling; that night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla so she love them
Looked at the jury, how can they judge him?
She screamed

[Chorus:]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

[Common:]
Fear in her chest, her face in tears,
Had her man's back. He was facin' years
In her name, though the place was his
They tryna to take everything except the kids
For years she been through scufflin' fights
While he tryna to hustle that white
Up all night wonderin' if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

[Chorus:]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please, let me testify

[Common:]
The judge yelled for order
Court reporter makin' her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him, she could see how the trial was affectin' him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protectin' him
They arrested him for murder, and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed

[Chorus:]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please, let me testify

[Common:]
The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated, he was guilty on all charges
She shakin' like she took it the hardest
A spin artist, she brought her face up laughin'
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifyin' and cryin'
When this bitch did the crime: The Queenpin...

[Chorus:]
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Before you lock my love away, before you lock my love away
Please, let me testify

You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, please let me testify
You accuse me of a, you accuse me of a, you accuse
Please let me testify, please let me testify


[Verse 1: Common]
Memories on corners with the fours & the moors [pronounced foes and moes]
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to
Got uncles that smoke it some put blow up they nose
To cope with they lows the wind is cold & it blows
In they socks & they souls holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened & closed hoping for more
With nowhere to go rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way cause they ain't knowing they goal
The streets ain't safe cause they ain't knowing he code
By the fours I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes & roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a "Olds" with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broke in & stole
These are the stories told by Stony & Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give ya this feeling
I wish I could give ya this feeling
On the corners, niggas robbing, killing, dying
Just to make a living (huh)

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
We underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when times stood still
And gators and snakes gangs and yellow and pink
And colored blue profiles glorifying that

[Verse 2: Common]
Streetlights & deepnights cats trying to eat right
Riding no seat bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nikes they head & they feet right
Desires of streetlife cars & weed types
It's hard to breath nights days are thief like
The beast roam the streets the police is Greeklike
Game at it's peak we speak & believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
Its steep life coming up where sheeplike
Rappers & hoopers we strive to be like
G's with 3 stripes seeds that need light
Cheese & weaves tight needs & thieves strike
The corner where struggle & greed fight
We write songs about wrong cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's and I heard that she bites
The corner

[Hook]

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dancers and
war cries that broke out on different corners
Power to the people, black power, black is beautiful

[Verse 3: Common]
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burger its
Cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalist
The dirt isn't just fertile its people working & earning this
The curb-getters go where the cash flow & the current is
It's so hot that burn to live the furnace is
Where the money move & the determined live
We talk play lotto & buy german beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners

[Hook]

[Spoken: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument,
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace and to love
Down on the corner...


[Dave Chappelle]
Tonight's musical guest
Two of Chicago's Finest emcees!
Give it up for Common and Kanye West!

"It's Common Sense!"

[Intro - Common]
Yeah! "Common Sense!" - [scratched]
It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!
On the Dave Chappelle Show!
Everybody gotta eat right?
It's the food baby!

[Chorus - Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)

[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him

[Chorus]

[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!

[Chorus]

[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me

[applause]


[Chorus: John Legend]
They say "What's happenin'?"
We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww

[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, "Tell Kara get us a show"
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say "You ripped" "Wow..." Yea, that's what they say
My niggaz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say "Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes"
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin "Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!"
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
if you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please don't ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
but it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again

[Chorus]
[Kanye West:] "Uh!" (hey!)

[Verse 3: Common]
They say "Dude think he righteous"
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say "life is a game," so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say "Sef kept the hood together"
I tell the young, "We can't play the hood forever"
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim "King" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say "The crochet pants and the sweater was wack"
Seen "The Corner", now they say "That nigga's back," uh...

[Chorus]


[Intro]
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us [x4]
(Listen) Why you had to hide away for [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Aston Martin king, Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
Iâm like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline, the sky is my eye line
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada, stay mellow like LaLa
Young fresh with dollars, ladies go gaga
Iâm the cum lauda, top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask, pure religion and cash
From the windows that open, Iâm raising my glass
Day light beams, night light schemes
This is my Inception, Iâm writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what Iâm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lordâs coming through

[Hook]
Oh-oooh-oh, in the sky weâll find the light
Oh-oooh-oh, ainât too high weâll shine at night
Now we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, last night

[Verse 2:]
It all started with a dream, I wanted to be Run D.M.C
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M, dreams were spoken to him
Thatâs when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes, yes sir this is what Iâm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose, from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world premoâs
Red carpet, imagine taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care, my music is the medicine
My name holds weight, I am never hesitant
Different state resident, this is hood elegance
SLS classic, pursuing my passion
Known for Fashion, now Iâm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what Iâm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lordâs coming through

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Silhouettes of dreams that we had huh
Even now it donât seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
Iâm gone now, imagine what Iâm gonna be
30 to worthy, now Iâm all worldly
My broad up in Paris, looking all purrty
Immortal view of a star doing what Iâm born to do
I see the blue sky, say the Lordâs coming through

[Hook]

[Outro]
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldnât take that long to get me there
Keep running 'til I canât go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how Iâm the one
Couldâve been anywhere, but Iâm sitting in the air
With the wolves up staring at the sun
Ohh, in the sky weâll find the light
Ohh, ainât too high weâll shine at night
No we in the skies, blue skies
And we going higher, last night


[Hook]
Everybody home, ainât nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, donât it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby gonna get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 1]
We partying, yeah got body in
Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian
Fly, we live it âtil we die
We living in the night, toast looking in her eye
On our paper âtil we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up, plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks
It donât stop here
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pacâs here
Celebrate like itâs new year
Some bomb rocks coming, type nuclear
Yeah, itâs so ridiculoâ
Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go
Backwards liquor store
Celebrate

[Hook]
Everybody home, ainât nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, donât it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby gonna get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 2]
In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic
My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight sheâll be giving conscious, headlights!
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got to act right for her like Iâm an author
Look where drama brought us, look where karma brought us
Married to the game, like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some R&B broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlas from the go, how far we done came
Celebrate

[Hook]
Everybody home, ainât nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, donât it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby gonna get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 3]
Ah, another night, we love the night
For the life, getting bugged tonight
Wait âtil I get my money right
Told you itâs gonna be on like the Benzâs that we lean on
Put my team on, get our heat on
Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay
My niggas move work even on a holiday
We come from porches and alleyways
Iâm the big ticket, donât need no one to validate
You celebrate

[Bridge]
We ainât gotta wait
Itâs a toast to you and me
Bills ainât so bad, celebrate that
Party in the yard âtil the lights come on
Ainât nobody crying
Weâve come so far, been climbing
Know the clouds they passed us by
Câmon and raise your glass up high

[Hook]
Everybody home, ainât nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, donât it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby gonna get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate


[Verse 1]
We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop! Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her, it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence, your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust from the cloth

[Hook]
Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same, cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh
La la la la, la la la la

[Verse 2]
This is tailor-made love, fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my cuz passed away
Not only does love, but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you, the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present, no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take it's course
Because what's inside of us, no need to outsource
The cloth

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth

[Hook]


[Hook]
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggasâ dreams
Ghetto ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggasâ dreams
Ghetto dreams
Ghetto niggasâ dreams
From the hood

[Verse 1: Common]
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she tricking from the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake
Her titties ainât fake
Fucking in the car cause we just canât wait to get home
Early in the mornâ getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, runny by Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I would rather stay alive for
Tatts on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathers the storm
Seen her brother die so forever sheâs strong
Hear Beyonceâs song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I donât even say shit, she can feel it
I toss the realest, sold nails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and itâs hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Frying chicken, macaroni
Raise on the [?]
Ghetto press, sheâs my apolonni like
Tony, Montana
Reminded me of mio ma or my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a niggaâs squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My beats is the streets and I know who my friends is
In this love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the canvas ain't closed
When the cameras snap snapping, sheâs ready to pose

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nas]
I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly âbout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldnât mention
For me, getting women turn from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes
Congress women inflicting pain onto my game
Warned that Iâm sadistic
They liked it, they diked it, devices twisted
Til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, slap a door behind a white fist
But Iâm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, Iâm a bachelor
Yâall niggas in trouble, keeping girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I havenât chose yours
She loves glamour bought Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette
My man is half hood half class
Photographers cameras caught us out there
The spotlight, I hope she can handle
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Event having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live the dream with me when you are just in the projects

[Hook]


[Hook]
So we made it to this [?] down the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

[Verse 1]
Ashtrays and cigarretes, last days, indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success, I want yâall to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it, and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born, three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago, we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the truly living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine, back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending, drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess itâs my addiction to women
I was in France, Hennessey blending
Writing my own scripts like Iâm Tennessee Williams
Now itâs new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic, victorious, story is redemption

[Bridge]
Iâm sitting at the top, Iâm not alone
Iâm standing here with my soul

[Verse 2]
Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like I was 5-0, but my creedâs Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came, Iâm made the song cry for âem
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
This is that Kilimanjaro, like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo, check my youth revival
Truth inside flow, I stand like Em did with Dido
Crashed parties, any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the, killed the game and watched it die slow
Ali MC, I fight for more than the title
Your idol

[Hook]


[Hook]
I remember, I remember the days

[Verse 1]
I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is gunna get ya
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures, God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the benches
I was tripping, I even called her sister
How could someone you could talk to, each and every day
That you 'bout to marry, be on their merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

[Hook]
I remember, I remember, I remember
(It happens to the best, so I love and I lost)
I remember, I remember, I remember

[Verse 2]
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had, some say it comes from not seeing my dad, keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
On you and us, I tried to take it day by day, and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess, I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love, I'm saying God bless
Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?

[Hook]


Yeah, yeah, bring it on
Uh huh, with the ya ya, yeah
Just sitting around kicking it a little bit
I thought we would record something tonight
And I do want to dedicate it to two very outstanding people
I live the spirit of
Gentlemen Crispus Attucks and Mr. Marcus Garvey
Thank you so much

The Believer
If I were a believer, I believe I would believe in the beginning
Everybody's beginning
Mine, that my very first ancestors were front row and present
When God stepped to the mic
I believe from the creation of the Garden of Eden
The separation of the tribes
Our long marches across the desert
Being [?] kids
For instincts born in caves of ice
All, each and every one, the souls of one God
Granted earthly existence to allow each to earn
The blessing of transcending, time-traveling throughout the universe
With the blessings and well-wishes of my fathers, prophets of my own
No search, no steer, no mysteries
We inherit the power to turn nightmares into dreams
For those of us who come from less than [?] circumstances
Dreams. good dreams, sweet dreams, dreams come true
Truthful dreams, truthful dreams become life
Life becomes belief, belief becomes live!
Live the life you believe
The American dream, the black American dream, the universal dream
For the sake of the unwritten laws of humanity, I believe in God
I believe in my ancestors, I believe in my offsprings
I believe in Dr. Saviour, I believe we must stop Willie Lynch'n mention each other
I believe in the truth, truth
See you next lifetime


La la la la la
La la la la la

[Verse 1]
Bow! Bow!
I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela superstar status
Everything stellar, with some bad bitches and some ex-drug sellers
Niggas already jealous, we in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick, bitch donât be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The bar maidâs name is Stella
Iâm so appalled like McCartney, would you record me
Am I really mad? Hardly, Iâm here to party
One of yâall to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fa
Seen a girl she had bottom like a speak-er
Wanna put some hands on her like a preach-er
Hmmmm! Well let me take my time
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
âBout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said âYou rap?â Yea mummy
Iâm Tutankhamun kicking it, spending this rap money

[Hook x2]
Feels so good
I wanna touch somebody
So letâs go, go
Wanna feel you close, keep touching

[Bridge x4]
La la la la la, how you like it

[Verse 2]
She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in cause Iâm lord
Of finesse, the under, the rings, the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, Iâm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
Iâm locked into my mood, Long as dude donât disturb my groove
I wonât have to take it back to high school
Rewind! No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause whatâs in front of me is this behind
Up north sheâs thick, down south sheâs fine
Tuned in to what Iâm doing
Iâm so unassuming when Iâm pursuing
The ladies, the ladies, a soldier of love like Sade
So in love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh! You donât wanna test this yo
You never know who got a check up in the disco
âYou Hollywood.â Nah nigga, Iâm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x4]


You know they be asking âbout Common, where he at?
Iâm doing what I do, hip hop, thats what I do
Yeah

How can I say this, fuck it Iâm the greatest
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
A lot of yaâll nah nah, forgot na, who I am
The â87 nigga used to rah rah in the jam
Ow yeah, we put them things in the air
When I drop a single, itâs really like a pair
Of Air Jordans, important to the culture
If you aint true to it, callate la boca
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on a wall, a mic, used to live off
Hip Hop Master cleanse, Iâmma get my shit off
Rollinâ in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit off like a monster, live nigga this is my encore
Encore, encore, I rhyme for the commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
Iâm to hip hop what Obama is to politics
Common is

Yeah, man, yâall niggas man, you soft muthfuckers
Yeah my man, muthafcker
Then come around my crib
You know where Iâm from
Some hoes ass niggas
Singing all around me man, la la la
You aint muthafucking Frank Sinatra
Uh, lil bitch
Yeah, this the raw right here
Yeah this the raw right here nigga
Sweet muthafuckas
Sweet ass bitch muthafucka

Wa da da da, wa dada dada da
The C-O double-M O-N, Iâm not playinâ
Da da man at work, I make my own lane
Iâm the franchise so I rock my own chain
No I. said give âem that 80â²s cocaine
Somethinâ raw, something pure so I stayed in that vain
The hero that he know, that he cold
like winters below in the Geo, wipe ya feet off in the Regal
Iâm king, observe the throne and the dream
I have it, supreme like mathematics
Yeah, I rep the fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro black magic, this is semi-automatic
Rap we wonât jam in traffic
The game need direction, Iâm here to map it
Uh, some people say that they be missing creativity
But when it come to hip hop, it begins and itâs with me
Sweet

You know man, you should know where I come from
You should know who I am nigga
You should never wanna go against me
You know man, you too soft for that man
I be seeing you man, I see it in your eyes man
You aint the type of nigga to go against me
You get in my presence you gonâ feel like a little hoe
You aint a man yet, you tryna be somebody else
Man, be yourself man, you come around my crib, you get your shit took
Huh, wherever you go, you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo shit took
Youâs a hoe, you know you sweet
Aint nothing you can do man, people see that man
Broads be seeing you sweet
Done witâ you muthafuckas, itâs over for you
Itâs over for you? Itâs over, sweet muthafucka


[John Legend - Hook]
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

[Common - Verse 1]
These are the words of a believer, achiever, leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest, no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and itâs process
Birth of a son, death of another
With love I can rest both mothers
And told âem, whoâs in control is the one thats above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous, pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
Itâs tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us
Look at the picture, hard not to blame us
But time forgives and the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we havenât taught them?
Is it what we talking we really ain't walking
Dudes, hustlers pay, how much did it cost âem?
Find myself on the same corner that we lost âem
Real talking, in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the World
When I see them, I see my baby girl
Believe

[John Legend - Hook]
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

[Common - Verse 2]
The lord lives among us
The young guns hunger become a means to get it
By any means necessary, under pressure
Children feeling lesser, with the steel up on the dresser
Killinâ will aggressors, destinyâs children
Survivors, soldiers, in front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons, sirens, holsters
That aint the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being oppressors to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning, shawtyâs know to keep learning
Lessonâs in our life, but life stripes that we earning
Took raps advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night, I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street kids spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us, even through the unseen, I know that God watches
From one Kingâs dream he was able to Barack us
The prophets, nothing can stop us
Believe

[John Legend - Hook]
I believe in the light that shines and will never die
Oh I believe the fire burns, we stay alive
They will talk about us
Like they talked about the kings before us
They will talk about us

I know I know I know our dreams wonât turn to dust
They will talk about us
I know I know I know our dreams wonât turn to dust
They will talk about us
I know I know I know our dreams wonât turn to dust
They will talk about us


For the world world world
My name is Common, No I.D

[Verse 1]
Ferrari testers, Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured, we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga âYe Iâm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like Iâm Kobe now
We celebrate the [?], they hate because we got love
Itâs the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lie than an opera
New crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, Iâm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, Iâll drop out like Hiroshima
Off Sangria with two broads
Still opening roads for
Iâm a dreamer

[Hook]
Itâs for the world world world world world
Dream on

[Verse 2]
We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, Iâm the pace maker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Career ainât random, make anthems, streets chant them
Rock rolls like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
Itâs Common, Iâm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
To rock the planet, I donât stop for panic
Maybe Iâm a hopeless hip-hop romantic
Iâm a dreamer

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world, the world is at my fingers
âBout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now itâs gold records, and Iâm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

[Bridge]
If I dream youâre here
Angel dreaming there
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it

[Maya Angelou]
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow, you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico, from Asia, they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream


[Hook:]
If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

[Verse 1]
She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she Sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men, she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok sometimes from commitment, we do them
Rocking Lou Vuitton, said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing
Shhh, 'til your soul just listen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view, my life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it, God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man, how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really really need me
A lot of girls without, they become needy
"C'mon dad, I'm too old for the back seat
Can you come and get me, are you coming to my track meet?"
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'mma coach ya"


Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give you 
(love to give..you, you)
love to give you
love to give

[Verse One]
It was a dream day
Met her on spring break,
look like the type that be like 
"no habla engle"
she said you look like you rap
where's your bling'e
and yours clothes is tight
but you dont seem gay
I said naw
thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasnt married
kept her ring on her pinky
She said "you know I dont be datin' rappers"
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor.

[Chorus]
Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh)
(love to give..you, you) (give, give it, yeah)
love to give you (give, give it, uh)
love to give (give, give it, yeah)

[Verse 2]
See her again at All Star weekend
she didnt have tickets 
and she ain't into hoopers
she was there to kick it
with her roommate 
who was a video vixen
spend so much on outfits
she's about to get evicted
said "I'm married to this rap shit,
looking for a mistress"
you can be by my side 
like flavor and deelicious
long as you ain't scared of the kitchen and the dishes
she said "you one of them fishes, I know your mind switches", and..

[Chorus]
Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh)
(love to give..you, you) (give, give it, yeah)
love to give you (give, give it, uh)
love to give (give, give it, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Time revolve 
we fell in love as crazy as Nas and them 
broads were textin
cuz I stop calling them
I met the parents 
watch the game with her father and
questions of marriage 
and I start dodging them 
what happen to me 
happens to lots of men
get deep in love 
and then your needing some oxygen
as far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
she said "there you go, breakin my heart again!"

[Chorus]
Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh)
(love to give..you, you) (give, give it, yeah)
love to give you (give, give it, uh)
love to give (give, give it, yeah)

[interlude]

[Chorus]
Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you
(she said "don't break my heart")

Oo..we you break my heart, 
but I'll be there beside you,
With lots of love to give you (give, give it, uh)
(love to give..you, you) (give, give it, yeah)
love to give you (give, give it, uh)
love to give (give, give it, yeah)


It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
No it's not a mystery, it's everything

She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill, uh, like "Okay, go"
Had a body, A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those Lebeaus
Spin class at the gym, strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes, tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these (hoes)
Readin Us and People Mag, tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers, then came the pumps
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
No it's not a mystery, it's everything

He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc, mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks, in his ears he kept jewels
One of the Diddy types, da D-D-Dame Dash dudes
Pushed a Maserati Sport, readin the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe, you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
No it's not a mystery, it's everything

They was one of them couples, people said they were the it
Unbreakable, like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese, or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs, in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
It's this thing now, that's drivin' me wild
I gotta see what's up before it gets me down
No it's not a mystery, it's everything

Gets me down
Gets me down 
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me down
Gets me
No it's not a mystery, it's everything


[1st Verse]
Victory won, in a world of hennessy and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles, we
Fought for ours, parted in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognized importance of family
Hand me a joint, good music, and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave, my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises
And street life is pumpin' fast lives, and
I watched Crash and realized that we're all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt, move dirt, but never really talk about it
Forever begins, jus' because I thought about it

[Chorus]
Living
Once Again
We...

Living
Then you're gone [x4]

[2nd Verse]
Ashes and snow falls, I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes, say I'm never gon' run
Sooner than later, I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury, together we hung
Now we let our chains hang, and gang bang to maintain
Afghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down, at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars, peace and exclusive cars
Through the wire I learned to earn hard
Watched gangstas turn God in the midst of War
No matter how much I elevate, I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we lived forever through song

[Chorus x2]

[Common's Father]
Origin is forever
Well, well well,
We are back in the studio again
Look at that
Hey, I don't need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin' up cue cards
What that say
Oh they say; "just talk, don't sing"
Son, I bet you feel like you and I've been here
Forever
30 years old red eyes,
Beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah, origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 values
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of the chime
That's forever
Forever is to strive
A place of endearment
Forever,
Forever is what I leave
My I-self contribution
Damn, what I'm gon' leave?
Ok...
I leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand

To universal scales of humanity
All humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis, Hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
War, War, and more War
Floods, Columbine, Global Warming, Earthquakes
Another somebody's done me wrong, son
Virginia Tech, there's not a hole but to Heck
We're still, did you place your one grain of spiritual sand forever?
Confusion need a solution
Blend and stir, stir and blend the part of humanity
Sift the ingredients of acknowledgment, apology, amendment, atone
We gonna work with the four A's here
Forever part
Common good is forever
God's memory is forever....


Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'cause the pain, pain now as a storm
I remained, holding on
'cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you

I've been thinking bout, I've been thinking about
I've been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I'm a keep dreaming on
It's kind of like 'The Breakup' with Jen and Vince Vaughn

[Chorus:]
Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
'cause the pain, pain now as a storm
I remained, holding on
'cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

They say you don't know, know, know what you got
Till what you got is gone
Yeah I write such and such, you're a lot but the feelings not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

[Chorus]

We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

'cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you
'cause I want you, 'cause I want you
I want you, I want you


Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
No one can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Common]
Yeah, uh (Misunderstood)
We do this, for the people that walk that path
Tryna get to their dream, yeah, uh (oh)

He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin
He knew the President wadn't addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him
He on the ground he could feel God touching him
He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him
At heaven's gate, saying please Lord let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men

[Chorus]
Misunderstood
'Cause we are - Misunderstood
Misunderstood, Don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just human, oh

[Common]
Uh, yeah
She dancin she dance she dance for them
Her body move but her mind was manic'n
Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her, now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and, heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God, feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

[Chorus]

The life we lead, will always lead us
And we pray that he, will never leave us
It's the price we pay, I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang, we all need Jesus [2x]

Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood
Misunderstood, don't let me be, misunderstood
I'm just human


[Intro - D'Angelo]
Ohhh, ohhhh...
I wanna get closerrrrrr to you, baby...
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh...
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh...

[Chorus - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go (Yeah)
Say it again!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go (Yeah)
OHHHHHHHHHHH!

[Verse 1 - Common]
Ugh, ugh!
Sweetheart, you know that you most
Important, at least on the West Coast (Huh!)
I'm just trippin', it's somethin' about your throat
You think different and understand how I float
Got cribs on both Coasts
But, I'm a Chicago-getter
You (Get Down), but you ain't a (Golddigger)
You got the soul with the figure to match
Your girlfriend said, "Yo, that dude is a catch!"
Creative with the gifts, plus he hit it from the back! (Ugh!)
And places we ain't supposed to
We make the music - baby, you on the vocals
International lover, I never stay local
Go to places that you never been
Beautiful outside, even better when it's in
You have arrived, girl - you can come again!
C'mon!

[Chorus - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
Say it again!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
OHHHHHHHHHHH!

[Verse 2 - Common]
You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you
But, I'm the only one that can get to you
Lifting you, my drive is shifting you
I opened you free, it's like a gift to you
I truly am thickly and thankful
And as long I'm in your town, I'mma stay
(Faithful) (Heh!)
You know I can't escape you
No matter how far, you're still my star
You was there when the marks tried to steal my car
Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are
Sophisticated woman, you understand a man
You don't call all the time just to see where I am
Put a "G" in your hand, make sure you're livin' alright
Makin' love is me and I'mma give it all night
Turn over in the morning, make it warmer and better
Long as we can be, we can come together
C'mon!

[Chorus - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
I don't believe you heard me, baby!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go

[Bridge - D'Angelo]
Go on, go on then!
Go on - go on, girl!
Go on, go on - go on, baby!
Go on, baby!
Go on, girl!
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

[Chorus - D'Angelo]
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You know what I mean, baby!
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You have come so far
You've got so far to go
You have come so far
You've got so far to go


La, la, la, la, la - and everybody say
La, la, la, la, la - I know you, I know you...

I know you're thinking, thinking that it must be
Armorall flow 'cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it, man dawg trust me
Bust somebody head, G.L.C. where was we?
Still rock the Prada 'fore that, rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown, the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects, and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project, and come back and tear the mall up

[Chorus]
We coming from the..
South (side), South (side)
South (side), South (side)
South (side), South (side)
South (side), Side of the Chi

The broads, the cars, the half moon, the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CD's with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in '94 they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eatin' jo, you still talking no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steven Jobs

[Chorus]

Your fly is open, McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep, I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like crutons
People asking him, "Do you have any grey poupon?"

[Chorus]

You in the building but the buildings falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Back in school, you all niggas you should call in August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out, while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem, I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap, we're calling

[Chorus]

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say, "Yeah, ran up at the Oscars."
Poppa, I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em' played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans don't love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters, Holla
We some true chi-town legends, accept no imposters

[Chorus]

Uh, the un-American idol, tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it, rock wit it, Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible, and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery, and 'Beat It' like Michael
Your career is a typo, mine was written like a haiku
I write to 'Do the Right Thing' like Spike do
through Conflicts that's Crucial and Drama that's Psycho

[Chorus]

La, la, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
We're coming from the...Hey!
[scratches:].. spice it up (la, la , la..)
Ya might have to spice it up
Spice it up, spice it up,
Take your life and...
Yo, we're coming from the...Hey!
We're coming from the...Hey!

...and this concludes our Chicago show
Please stay tuned


[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now let's start the show show
Step out of the cold cold
We come from the 'Go, 'Go
To the top of the globe globe
The pimps and the hoes hoes
The Folks and the Stones Stones
Whoever you ride fo', we back for some mo'
Get back to the show show, you know

[Common]
Uhh, uhh
Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double-M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emb-lem
Hardcore since I was next door to Clem and them
Cold as the winter when fake niggaz was shiverin
Shakin in they Timberlands, you was played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a +Master+ since P was No Limit-in
Stick a sayin, no gimmick and no mimickin
Q infinitin down old blocks are bendin in
Yellin (Fuck Tha Police) like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggaz on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggaz knew Rashid
Noble like Dru Ali - many have come
but few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along wit it, inside you knowin it's wack
Young who? I don't need a openin act [echoes]

[Chorus]

[Common]
Let, let, le-le-le-le-le-let's go
It's a festival in hip-hop; we do it non-stop
Pop your bottles, Chicago niggaz do it in staccato
Choppin notes for my homies, fuck a motto
And Farragamo shoes givin dudes the model
Think fast, drive slow, survival is the throttle
Your live show is hollow, shoulda kept it local
Rappin over vocals, soundin soft as JoJo
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's a gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy ration-al
Half of it is what you say, and half is style
Guess it's time for you to stop cashin now
It's over folks, tell your guys to put the glasses down
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin the sheets [echoes]

[Chorus]

"And you say Chi-City, let's go Chicago!"
[applause]
"Yo, y'all can make more noise than that!"
"Get live y'all, get live y'all, ah-get live y'all
Ah-get live y'all, ay y'all can get louder than that
Louder, LOUDER!"


[Chorus - Samples]
"It's only right that I address this..."
"Gotta be in it to win it..."
"I never come lame type killin in the game..."
"Now... get busy..."
"It's only right that I address this..."
"Gotta be in it to win it...."
"I never come lame type killin in the game..."
"Hot music..."

[Verse One]
Raised by game where niggas ain't phased by fame
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain.
Stay in your lane, Brokeback ain't the way of the game
My brainstorm is like I stay in the rain
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the flame
Ghetto pain and windows crack, the fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the real interact
In the middle of whack my soul sticks to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids
You don't know it like you gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the Game

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
I never kissed the ass of the masses, I'm the black molasses
Thick and I lasted past these rat bastards
They try to box me in like Cassius Clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist, make cuts and got gashes
Scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab hits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes it's too many slashes
In his name, came in the game these gun-clappers
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run while I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
from the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beemers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
GOOD bring business to the hood like heralds
Find your own, walking by themself in the street
The young die of cancer, I stop eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th street like peace
Even though it's war to G, got em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and they complacent with beats
My radio station is deep, so eff em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

[Chorus]


Louder, louder, louder, louder, louder, louder
louder, louder, Yeah
[Repeat]

Yeah, it's for the People

[Verse 1]
This is street radio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothers and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustling, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touching them
The People

[Chorus:]
The day, has come
Now we, are one
Just take, your time
And then, you'll find

[Verse 2]
This is street radio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's, though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what, the people gone see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe, until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize, music affected lives
A gift from the skies, to be recognize
I'm keeping my eyes on the people, that's the prize

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
This is street radio, for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal, trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga, yours is my drama
Standin in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people sake
The People

[Chorus]


[Hook]
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe...

[Common]
I heard a white man's yes
Is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world
As a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention
And I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip
I watch the fat lady sing a song
On how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreamin wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the walgreens is gone
Hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
Its hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave We afraid to the same streets that raised you
Can aid you. What other black births came suit
the rage up in harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with there mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man, woman, and child maybe

[Hook - 2X]

[Common]
He had game since he used to hoop at chattum
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
when paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back
Now that's black...maybe

[Hook - 2X]

[Common - talking]
When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from...from other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judged..you get laughed at..you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us..black maybe

black maybe...

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
Ready for the war we got our boots strapped
100 deep on Stage Street
Where the troops at?
The mayor lying saying he didn't see the video footage
And everybody want to know where the truth at
On the South side where it's no trauma centers, but the most trauma
A lot of cannons but you don't want no drama
I can't imagine if it was my own mama
Got her first born son stole from her, he never had a chance
And we all know its cause he black
Shot 'em 16 times, how fucked up is that?
Now the police superintendent wanna double back
Cops speeding up to the block like a runnin' back
Tension is high, man these niggas is irate
You can see it in they eyes, they wanna violate
Screaming out "Oink! Oink! Bang! Bang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Gang! Murder! Murder!"
Murder they mind state
I just made me a mil' and still militant
This ain't conscious rap, this shit ignorant
Nigga, hair trigger
Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the gun
When I cock back, police better run

[Hook:]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots

[Verse 2:]
They threw a little girl down on the pavement
Pushed her off the bike and said, "Stay out the way, bitch"
She was bleedin' on the ground through her braces
This is what happens when niggas don't stay in their places
The mayor duckin' when he fired the superintendent
But resignation come with bonuses and recognition
So we gon' break in the stores on Magnificent Mile
And if we gotta go, let's go to prison in style
Cops killin' kids and stayin' out of jail
But Bobby Shmurda can't even catch bail
So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Now I got everybody yellin' out, "Fuck 12"

[Hook:]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots

[Refrain:]
There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin'
There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin'

[Verse 3:]
Me and Lord got a clip with an extendo
And we rollin' with it, hangin' out the window
We on 16th ridin' by the police station
We might make a pork rind out of pig, bro
Somebody tell these mothafuckas keep they hands off me
I ain't a mothafuckin' slave, keep your chains off me
You better hope this 9 millimeter jam on me
Or get blown, I hope you got your body cam turnt on
Fuck a black cop too, that's the same fight
You got a badge, bitch, but you still ain't white
This for Laquan on sight, when you see Van Dyke
Tell him I don't bring a knife to a gunfight

[Hook:]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, fuck 12
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots
16 shots
And we buckin' back
16 shots

[Refrain:]
There's a war on drugs, but the drugs keep winnin'
There's a war on guns, but the guns keep ringin'
Singin'

[Bridge:]
Mu-u-u-u-murderer, murderer
Mu-u-u-u-murderer, murderer
Mu-u-u-u-murderer, murderer

[Outro - Jeffrey Neslund:]
The video shows Laquan walking southbound down the middle of Pulaksi, which is a four lane street in Chicago, two lanes going northbound, two lanes going southbound. There are squad cars visible in front of him and also squadcars behind him. The dash cam video is from one of the responding units which was trailing Laquan approximately 20 to 25 feet behind him. The shooter's squad car is visible as it drives past Laquan and parks in the middle of Pulaski behind another squad car. Two officers then exit that vehicle with their guns draw. At that point, Laquan begins to walk away from the officers on a southwest angle towards the sidewalk. What Laquan is about 12 to 15 feet away from the officers, the width of an entire lane of the southbound traffic, one officer begins shooting. Laquan immediately spins to the ground and the video then shows that the officer continues to shoot Laquan multiple times as he lays in the street. 16 seconds pass from the time Laquan hits the ground until the last visible puff of smoke rises from his torso area. An officer then approaches Laquan, stands over him and appears to shout something as he kicks the knife out of his hand


[Verse 1:]
Free man shit
We don't need no cops round here
I got my dick in hand cause I know a lot of y'all niggas running scared
I got God on my side and I know the devil trying to take a nigga under
Really makes me wonder
And I'm feeling like the 2nd coming
As I fucked the world for the first time and she love it

[Chorus:]
I think this life is the only one for me
I wouldn't trade it for nothing, unless
She was 5'7, pretty waist, coke bottle, basket case
You know me I like the danger
You know me I like the danger

[Verse 2:]
I'm on I-95
Double fist tequila when I drink and drive
2016 I gotta get it now
Pray to God I'm still alive
Put your lighters up
Let me take you where I was
Southside ain't safe outside
Seen a nigga standing on 47th street with a black Glock nine in the sky
Put your bangers up, twitch your fingers up, bangers up
Niggas yelling Game! but niggas ain't tailored up
Nah, inked up, I'm tatted up
Run up on the studio and Rata-Tat-Tat it up rrrrtt
I let all my niggas talk for they self
They like to jugg, man they like easy money
They like making that shit hard for they self
I just realized I don't fuck with y'all
I just gotta stack my money tall
You know that feeling when you at the bank
Tryna quit cigarettes going through withdrawals
And you always knew you had what it takes
So you feeling like it's time that you take it all
Lying through they teeth niggas too fake
That's the reason really, really why I hate you all
That's how I feel out here, shit is real out here
Young niggas really out here in the field out here, yea
What's the deal out here?
Trying to turn a couple hundreds to a mil out here, yea
And it's still our year
Niggas say they catching up they still not here
I'm looking around like
Where the fuck y'all at?
If you scared better keep your punk ass in the back

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I don't like the way that niggas talking like they bullet proof
Until they gotta find out what a bullet do
Catch two in your Canada Goose
It'll turn a nigga into proof, ooh
Shout out to my niggas on 8 Mile
Shout out my niggas on Flatbush
Shout out to my niggas up in Cape Town
Gang-banging, rolling up the ops and the Backwoods
Don't get turned into a pack kid
You know how to act kid
You know where we at yea
You know what The Blueprint is
Ain't really shit for me and Jay to lay a nigga flat yea
And we build it from the ground man
I made the foundation like bitches with make-up
You're flexing your Jacob
You're cut like a shape up
The city so hot it might dry the whole lake up
I need it God, I could ride like a race horse
I need a bitch to stay A1 like the steak sauce
Pussy so good I might stay like my pesos
Bitch and my gang, I'm the chief like a Halo
I go hard in the paint like a DayGlo
I tell Aoki he look like Towkio
I'm on my new HOV and Nas its a takeover
Young boy but I'm an OG like I'm Maco

[Chorus]


[Intro:]
There's a lot goin' on, but this the dynasty

[Verse 1:]
The crazy man's keepin' me up, I'm not sleepin'
My fit too fresh to be doin' the housekeepin'
The maids cost too much, started cleanin' my own closet
Livin' childhood fantasies, dealin' with grown problems
Got a brand new bae, she keep me good like the music
If the Roc is here, throw up your diamonds and hood cubics
No I.D. said it's time to take these goofy niggas out rap
Drop bombs over Baghdad on these SoundCloud outcasts
I stray away to say the way my days would be without rap
My mind drifts to back before the Chi was labelled Chiraq
Then Chief Keef dropped in 2012, now it's a drill
I was waitin' in the wing like a bird on a windowsill
Now I'm the fresh prince, I think I know how my uncle feel
He sent this dope shit to my veins like fiends on any deal
After we build on existing structures, shift the culture
Like George Bush searchin' for weapons of mass destruction
Think I'm 'bout to blow! But this ain't the Middle East
This the midwest and we the royal family like Della Reese
SAVEMONEY the new dynasty like Death Row in '93
The same year my mother's water broke on 57th St
Mama Mensah knew she raised a very special man
Young Muhammad in the ring with the power in my hands
To defy the federation like Ali in Vietnam
The Roc is still alive, throw your diamonds up again

[Interlude]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I carry the Roc like a runnin' back, hundred miles and runnin' back
Hov the president, he flyin' private in Obama's jet
Vic the young hitta, I want it with any nigga
My problems' deeper than rap, ain't a problem to bury niggas
Cemetery diggers will be ready for your favorite rapper
Catch him stompin' in my yard, I step up like a Beta Kappa
I am nothin' like these actors, they're only on camera
I hit 'em in the head like Holly Holm hit Ronda
And my home is Rwanda, blood diamonds and minors
High school students with guns hidin' in their binder
Gotta wear a clear bookbag and wear a hood pass
Hit you from the blindside, that's a no look pass
Rookie season, Steve Nash, they are just my sons
Catchin' alley oops, catch 'em in the alley, oops
I heard a certain who's who mad that I like the danger
Get your priorities straight like Hermione Granger
Sixteen in the magazine and one in the chamber
Sneak it in the club, that's a club banger
This is not a diss song, this a disclaimer
Sorry that your management can't manage my anger
Violence is not the answer but, lord, they done brought it to me
You gon' see a side of me, the South Side taught it to me
They gon' think I'm Akeem when I pull up and pull
A semi Uzi, auto, fully out the robber yellow hoodie
Yeah, Pelle Pelle bloody, Motown Berry Gordy
With the shits, levatory, tell a nurse, purgatory
[?] moms is mandatory, crack sentencin'
Bad parentin', put his dad on Maury, just another classic story
I know there's no master for me, I don't even buy chains
I don't rock diamonds, I just need the Roc chain
I don't get high no more, I go high octane
They should call the rap game my name, this is my game, Vic!

[Outro:]
To the police
You can not
You can not
You can not
You will not
Kill me
If you want justice, make some noise
Let's go
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots
16 shots

[Verse 3 - Ty Dolla $ign:]
Drink bombay 'til we all fucked up

Couldn't make it up the stairs, had to get carried up, aye

[Hook:]
Let me pick my face up off the floor I'm off the D'USSÃ
I've been going so hard this week and shit it's only Tuesday
I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae
I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae
Pull up, pull up, I poured a drink let's get twisted, get twisted some more, yeah
Better be good to me, baby
Girl, you better be good to me
I see your eyes when you look at me I see your soul
I see your soul, you better be good to me, girl

[Verse:]
Yeah Yeah, damn she so bad but damn she look so good every time she get low
I ain't E-40, baby, but, baby girl I'mma tell you when to go
We skip the bed every time that we fuck we get straight to the floor
I buy the ticket you get on the road
She says she live in Australia, I'll fly you out to Chicago
She doesn't like the cold weather, she wants a vacay, a vacay in Cabo
She got the frame of a model,
I wanna ride like a saddle
I fall in love with her, 5'7" stallion
Fresh out the shower, I'm licking your asshole

My new bae, you're my new bae
Let's make a movie, are we moving too fast?
Who cares? You're my new bae
With my drinking I'll be on the floor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
New bae, new bae, up in Sacramento
D'USSÃ, D'USSÃ with the Amaretto
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang when I switch tempos
Put you on a new game, get experimental
Have you ever had your ass in the air, hands tied to the bed, legs tied to the leg post?
While your roommate watching, plotting, playing with herself like who gon' get the head most?
We can do the three-three, yeah, what about Kiki?
Bring her to the crib in the Hills with the studio, tell her we can have a little FeFe
Make you feel a way

I'mma run my finger in a spiral up your spine like a staircase
You know that I know the right spot, girl
How you doing squats, girl, I can make your legs shake
Hit you from the back, make the bed break
When I beat the brakes off it, yeah yeah
Pussy getting wet, let it marinate
Let a nigga taste something, girl, yeah yeah
You are fucking with a Chicago nigga, like DJ Pharris
Say, girl, it ain't nothing to spend on a bottle
That's just cause your body the truth if I dare say,
sound crazy
I know I'm talking crazy, girl, blame it on the D'USSÃ
But you look so bad if you're good to me I might just make you my new bae

[Hook]

[Outro]
My new bae, you're my new bae
Let's make a movie, are we moving too fast?
Who cares? You're my new bae
With my drinking I'll be on the floor


[Verse 1 - Vic Mensa:]
Color of more than pee coming out of the sink
It's 2016 who would think
Kids in America don't have clean water to drink
Like they cut the EBT took 'em off of the link
I read a story about a woman with her daughter in Flint
She got lead poisoning, from showers in the morning
When the governor switched out the pipes to bring the water in
To the city river cause he said they can't afford to get, clean water
So now the poor people get the shorter end
Of the stick, ain't that some bullshit?
Shorty thirsty, he just bought his fourth fifth
It's lead in the water gun, they dying from a full clip
And they got toddlers drinking toxic waste
While the people responsible still ain't caught no case
I don't get it man, I just ain't with it man
They got Damn Daniel distracting you on Instagram
Back again with the all white media coverage
They do it over and over like remedial subjects
The people with the least always gotta pay the most
They the first to go when they deleted them budgets
Can a nigga get his basic human rights?
Is that too much to ask, should I say it more polite?
And everybody broke so we in the same boat
But would they let that bitch sink if we was white?
They got me shades of blue

[Hook - Vic Mensa:]
Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue
Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue
Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue
Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you
It's all blue, all blue
It's all blue, all blue
The skies stay gray, around my way, around my way

[Verse 2 - Vic Mensa:]
Waking up to the morning sun in Detroit
I'll be with the people when they come for the boy
Everybody tryna be American idols
My X factor is I'm the only one with the voice
What's bigger than us is kids listen to us
That's why I give 'em that truth cause they don't get it enough
Everybody too busy online to see how these people lying on us and that shit's [?]
It ain't enough for police to wear body cams
Cause niggas still gettin tazed and body slammed
And cigarettes will kill you on their own but they'll kill you for a cigarette I honor Eric Garner fam'
I'm a part of him, he a part of me
I'm a prodigy in these Prada jeans
I'm tryna' make my partners a part of the election
So you ain't gotta presidential pardon me
And pardon me, but why is it that the darker must suffer?
How do we protect the culture from the vultures?
There's a Cold War every summer in the Chi
It's a snowball effect from the Cold War in Russia
But Vladimir Putin ain't in the hood recruitin'
And Derrick Rose ain't the only one out here shootin'
They set fire to their own squad cars
And a bitch on the news gon' blame it on the lootin'
And here I am talking 'bout a revolution
And I can't even spare a dollar to the movement
But I'm in the strip club spending dollars on that movement
I guess we all got room for improvement

[Hook - Vic Mensa:]
Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue
Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue
Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue
Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you
It's all blue, all blue
It's all blue, all blue
The skies stay gray, around my way, around my way


[Intro:]
Yeah, this just my life
Front to back, top to bottom

Everything's changing around me
These days don't feel the same
We all lost faith and lost family
Why must we play this game?
Lord have mercy on me
I've been a sinnin' man
Pull out my wings, jump off the bridge and crash in a plane
If I never land...

[Hook:]
Know I never die
We live forever in my mind
And I say goodbye
We live forever, still that life

[Verse:]
There's a lot goin' on but I stick to the ones I love
I never claimed to be a perfect man but name a great man who was
Consequences of my actions in the past years had me stressin' out
It was like, May, I just moved to L.A., I was tryna figure it out
Medication for depression that I cut cold turkey, had the kid manic
In an episode out in Hollywood, wildin' out like Nick Cannon
Railin' Adderall pills out a dollar bill, on the bathroom floor
Clean the whole mess up with my nose, what the fuck I need a vacuum for?
New York City on my birthday, June 6th, 2014
I had that first meeting with Hov, plus I brought out the whole team
I drank that whole bottle of D'usse Ty Ty gave me that night
When we left the club after Rap Genius house me and shorty got into a fight
She came out the room swingin', hit me in the jaw
I was really tryna fend her off
But I ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck
I was trippin', dawg
Too proud to apologize or empathize, I blamed it all on her
Sayin' that she hit me first, even though she was the one hurt
I was really just reflectin' all the hurt that I was feelin' from the band's rejection
When Kids These Days split, that shit felt like a c-section
And my infidelity and jealousy with Natalie on top of the amphetamines
And the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the Chesapeake
The next month I dropped "Down on My Luck" and had Europe goin' nuts
But I couldn't even appreciate it at the time, I was goin' through too much
Now I had to leverage million dollar label deals on the table for my records
In Ibiza eatin' paella on the roof, tryna choose over breakfast
Hov wasn't with the biddin' war, but I knew the Roc just felt right
When I saw Kanye at Wireless, without T-Pain, still a good life
Felt so close when Mr. Hudson introduced me to him backstage
He prolly don't even remember that shit... like a bitch off Backpage
But at that stage, I was ready to swing for the fence like a batting cage
At the same time, I was windin' down a low point in my addict phase
The Adderall started wearin' off and I went into a deep writer's block
All over a song that I couldn't finish that I wrote about signin' to the Roc
Isn't that ironic? I was feelin' so psychotic
With the whole world excited for me and my idol sayin' I got it
Shit got bad out in L.A., so I moved back home to my mom's basement
Linked up with Smoko and Papi Beatz and took it back to basics
Then I wrote "Rage, " that was me screamin' out through the pain
And "U Mad, " addressin' my relationship with Natalie, it was too bad
The violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health
I did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself
As I started to fall apart, certain stars started to align
Oh Mys came to Chicago in January at the perfect time
He said Kanye was workin' on an album, and Uzi played him one of our songs
He was tryna fly me out, nigga, it was goin' down like the Dow Jones
Pulled up to Westlake, first day I was there, I recorded "Wolves"
I knew I was the one, like Lyor meetin' with the oracle
But I had to get a handle 'fore the door was pulled
Crawled out on SNL
All the niggas hatin' on me back home lookin' at me like, "FML"
A lot of people comin' out the wood like, "Let's work, " tryna network
All the pressure makin' my head hurt, the molly wouldn't let the meds work
At this time it's like Feb. 1st to the 15th, and I'm still addicted
Frustrated, writin' shit for Ye, tryna visualize someone else's vision
Then he laid that verse on "U Mad" and we made the shit the single
Ye and Hov gettin' into it over me, tryna do a joint venture
And G.O.O.D. Music still fam, but it's that Roc boy SAVEMONEY life
Took the bus out on the road for the Traffic tour, did a hundred nights
Cleaned out my closet, I got rid of all of my demons
If you learn one thing from my journey, nigga it's don't stop believin'
When this shit got so suffocatin' I could barely even keep breathin'
Wrote my wrongs all in this song now I'd like to welcome y'all to my season
Nigga I'm gone

[Hook:]
Know I never die
We live forever in my mind
And I say goodbye
We live forever, still that life


[Vic Mensa:]
This for all my fans that say they want that old Vic
I've grown too much to ever be the old Vic
I'm new and improve call me Vic 2.0
Still making two points every time I move an O
That's the hustler talk for ya
I'm rappin' like a Google Home the way talk to ya
I gave my all to ya, you can judge it as you may
I know life's a bitch, but every dog has its day, hey
When I get low, this is how I fly away
You thank me, no thank you, you the reason I'm alive today
That's no exaggeration, I'm just glad you're listening
Me and Dion got more soul than your grandma kitchen
And we been cooking up this shit for little Vic
That 12-year-old kid that only wanna hear that real shit
This is a thank you letter to all my fans
For coming along for the ride with me, we almost there

[Mr. Hudson:]
I feel it coming
I'm almost there, I'm almost there
It's so close, I can taste it
It's in the air, it's in the air

[Vic Mensa:]
They judge you by your past and try to predict your future
But I got kings in my bloodline, I'm Mensa Musa
My dad came from Africa, he was the first to leave
From humble beginnings in that village to the birth of me
Birth of a Nation, shout out to Nate Parker
They take the spotlight off you if you a shade darker
But we made our own American on this cotton field
Till we got a black millionaire for every Emmett Till
I'm representin', I'm representin', I'm representin'
To my piece of American pie is never ending
You know pi, never ending, that's a slick line
This the type of flow that made them fuck with me the first time
But this ain't my first time like that J. Cole song
I'ma put the pressure on 'em all, I make coal turn into diamonds
I ride and die with my team
If I was Lebron, I'd never went to the Miami Heat
It's too much loyalty in me, I'm royalty, no Prince Akeem
So when I'm comin', make sure the royal penis is clean
Call me your highness, I just put a mink on my queen
She married a king, she deserve some Alexander McQueen
And I been ballin' out like I deserve a championship ring
I'm still a skater boy, I'm flippin' out like Avril Lavigne
I tweak on every little thing, that's why it took me so long
But the album is coming, it's done for you niggas, hold on
I set the mode for 'em, who was hot in the Chi' before I, nigga
N/A, I do not know nah nigga
Luke Cage, I'm a motherfucking fly nigga
And I'm still alive, I am not afraid to die nigga

[Mr. Hudson:]
I feel it coming
I'm almost there, I'm almost there
It's so close, I can taste it
It's in the air, it's in the air

Deep down, everyone's a rockstar
Right now, I'm the only one to take it this far
Take it this far
Up high in a glass elevator
Look down on my city see ya later
I, I always take it too far


[Pharrell (Sample):]
Pullin up with the coupe (Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof (Oh my goodness)
You sitting looking stupid on the stoop (Oh my goodness)
I would take notes if I were you (Oh my goodness)
This was designed with the stars, the square and the cross
So ain't no true north
Smilin', with 50 karats in my jaw
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme
Nigga, love crime

[Vic Mensa:]
It's a shame they let us jump out of Bentleys with dirty Vans
Hit the stage for 15 minutes, get 30 bands
Swiss bank counting clean money with dirty hands
With some hood niggas that's ready to bang with the Klan
Since I came in this shit, made my name a name brand
French kissing bitches in Paris, clubbing like a caveman
We threw up the pyramids, now they say we Illuminati
Fox fur cavalli, fuck Bill O'Reilly
No blood diamonds, I rock gold like a king
Jewelry so cold, made 'em blow the nose off the Sphinx
Fuck you think? I'mma be some type of role model?
I go full throttle desperado, that's the motto
Vic in Chicago, it's Hugh Heff in the grotto
Brazilian models is mean mugging like Frida Kahlo
Drinking a horchata with an Alicia Machado
Bitch, I'm the ticket, you just hit the lotto

[Pharrell (Sample):]
Pullin up with the coupe (Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof (Oh my goodness)
You sitting looking stupid on the stoop (Oh my goodness)
I would take notes if I were you (Oh my goodness)

So we know true north
Smilin', with 50 karats in my jaw
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme
Nigga love crime

[Vic Mensa:]
Young Vic the diamonds, the finest, I shine like
Puff signed Shyne, except I signed to the Roc 'cause I'm timeless
Top off the Masi, my behavior is mindless
Old kids, nigga, we major, you minors
Fresh out the cell to the booth, drop the Dylan Roof
I'm still in the hood, tell Zimmerman "Shoot"
Hold my nuts with an OJ glove, fuck the judge
You rappers is false flagging, you a fashion blood
What's brackin' cause? What you know about gangbanging?
What's V-lone thug? Why Bari leave your head rangin'?
Free Vic Mensa, I'mma start chain swanging
This that crack music, nigga, you can blame Reagan
I'm Balmaing without paying, y'all playing
We higher than a bitch, my bitch Himalayan
Suicide-ielago, that's sacrificial lamb
I'm killa season Cam
No lives matter, blam

[Pharrell (Sample):]
Pullin up with the coupe (Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof (Oh my goodness)
You sitting looking stupid on the stoop (Oh my goodness)

So we know true north
Smilin', 50 karats in my jaw
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme
Nigga love crime

[Pusha T:]
Every other night I'm outside with the nine
You ain't got chips, fuck the world
You got chips, you could fuck the next man's girl
Sounds harsh but they been ripped apart my world
The weight kiss told us should never be misquoted (no)
Them guns that you wave on the camera? We been toting (yeah)
Selling love potion my whole rap career
So your streams and downloads could never match the kids
We could go foreign for foreign until it's boring
My sheep will keep jumping the fence until you're snoring
Street poetry, I'm on Wale Folarin
Till the world is mine like Illmatic and Lauryn
Written on the globe
Face to a table full of blow
Fresh powder skiing in the snow
Type of rappers we know
Got the right numbers on a kilo
Burn the the carter down like I'm Nino

[Pharrell (Sample):]

Command, we've lost control
The engine's bound to crash
The lightning strikes went bright
Do not go gently...
It's just my luck
You shot my bluff down from a thousand miles
I'm falling fast
I'm falling fast

I want you to rage into the night
I want you to blaze into the light
Before your final flight
But boy, you're fine, you're fine
I want you to rage into the night
I want you to know, know you're right
Before your final flight
Racing, racing, red eyes are burning rogue

I always wondered whether leaving meant something deeper than freedom
To be able to see everything I see when I'm sleeping
Niggas waking up with no job, no mob lynching, we still hangin'
White man telling niggas to ball like Phil Jackson
Pray to Jordan, the play was enough to put up the bail
And a train don't stop and we ain't have to ride the rails
Gas in the tank, hardly enough to make it home
They say home is where the hate is, I'm from where they kill their own
Probably film it on their phone, a generation addicted
To take knowledge and problems we face and so conflicted
To take the burning road and just roll with the punches
Niggas thought I was gone, I Derrick Rose from the trenches
Same fences we jumped as a shorty still in the way
Sometimes I wish I could fly far, far away
Where my sins fall down like pouring rain
I'm on slip my knot, hope I don't fall again
Standing on my feet, feel so small to look into space
It's heavy just to stare up there and wonder what waits
So much we still don't understand, still right in front of our face
I light a match for the jets

I want you to rage into the night
I want you to blaze into the light
Before your final flight
Before your final flight
But boy, you're fine, you're fine
I want you to rage into the night
I want you to know, know you're right
Before your final flight
Before your final flight
Racing, racing, red eyes are burning rogue

Riding a burning road
Running low, not a soul who could know
It's every man who swept the burning ashes from the road

I put the halloween pistol out the trunk
Inside my mouth, if it was real, but I would dunk
That's fucking dumb
How many thousand of kids would like to have mine?
Without a clue of the times I gave my life to have time
I'm tired of waiting
Tired of chasing pills that I'm tired of taking
Tired of court cases, tired of judges
Tired of saying "Fuck it"
Tired of balling around the President, deciding this shit's a gift
Two shots to life, only got one to live
You could lose it any night
Or down it in a fit
Or win a championship game
As a man, I feel pain
As a king, I feel reign
Ask me how I deal with fame
As I write you from my basement
The cards ain't changed yet
Niggas on 47, still dealing the same shit
Rocks, blow
Ducking cops and clothes
Came into the world naked
Now I'm in all this BAPE shit
Tryna buy a Rolex, can't even face time
I feel like it's all wasted
The underground getting wasted
I spent 1500 on these bottles and this table
I shake it before I pop, I promise I'm not stable
But that boy do got horse power
Ignore hours
These days I lose tracks of days
Been years since I felt this way
Count on me to rage

Before the final flight
Before the final flight
I want you to rage
I want you to know, know you're right


Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner, I don't care about everything
Out of control, I forgot to take my medicine
If I take this pill, that would be death of me
I am a disaster, I don't need a recipe
Tried to be sober, that didn't work for me
I don't know your name, please excuse my memory
Anti-social, get the fuck away from me
I got a problem

Rockstar life
I got the salts, I got the spice (Vroom, vroom)
Fuck every night
And if she bad, I hit it twice, yeah

(Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

One, two, three too many drinks, I think I might forget
How to count to ten, I tend to turn two shots into a fifth
I drive better when I'm drunk
I rock leather like a punk
Hennessy make me Dead Kennedys, I get too drunk to fuck
They say "Vic, are you okay"?
Dude, no way
I don't even know no more
I don't even pour no more
But I be leanin' like a cholo
Tony Hawk I go overboard
Need to take it slow mo'
Your girl treat me like a Polaroid
Shake it for a photo
Swi-swi-swimming in alcohol
My Marco Polo
Baby girl I am a loner
Flyin' high and solo
Rollin' like a stoner
Out of control
Cause I got a problem nobody knows

(Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin')
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
Rollin' like a stoner
I got a problem nobody knows

Pour another cup, yes
I can hear the voices, in my head
Tellin' me to jump off, of the edge
I got a problem, nobody knows
I got a problem, nobody knows
I got a problem, nobody knows


[Malcolm X:]
And once we see that all these other sources to which we've turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves
Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern, you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern

[Vic Mensa:]
This is a higher level of thought
I let the mind work and the song play the long way
To show the true meaning of the heart
Yeah, take it back to start
In 6th grade, when I was stealing
And never thinking of getting caught
Then I came up, got a little game up
Used to leave up out the playground and go flame up
Writing graffiti tryin' to get a nigga name up
The paint used to bubble on the glass
Like pourin' champagne up
Started out fast, no change up
I Rememberin when you hear a girl parents on the phone and you hang up
Man the first time I got arrested I was 13
Stealin blunts from the store blowin dirt green
Paint on my clothes, I couldn't keep a shirt clean
Never been a bench player, always on the first team
And PHLI put me on that fresh shit in '06
When I used to call shoes in the store, "kicks."
The part of memory [?] miss
Cause ain't nobody see it like a youtube video with no hits
I spit crack, keep the fiends with a flow fix
Ya girl is bomb my nigga, she blow dicks
I'm trappin', and I ain't never sold no bricks
Grindin' in the same pair of jeans till the hole rips
I thought I made when I started buying whole zips
And now my niggas are blowing O's like smoke tricks
Listening to Wiz, higher then a flight school
I keep a 4 point, and I'on even like school
I'm hotboxin' with the tint to let the light through
I lot of niggas be trippin about the shit I might do
I'm like a wrinkle in time
I would rather make a classic
Than drop a fuckin single and sign
Let them other niggas mingle in line, twinkle and shine
A star [?] 99 brinkle to grind
It's cold wine when I drink and I dine
Got problems, but I'm like bougie bitches
I be thinkin I'm fine
Now hol' up
Who do you go to, when you the one to go to?
And ya'll don't the shit they be sayin' like goku
Look, you know the bars get dumber every other summer
I'm like izzy nigga, finger, snap, bummer
Greg, what up? I'm the rapper he the drummer
You the lame and ya girl do the pipe, she the plumber
I'm zoned out, flyin in a another dimension
Another day, another detention
Smokin with eddie and em
Gramps bout to puff on his pension
And I just fuckin suspension
So I'm back where I started at
Cardiac, flow get a heart attack
The snapback cap was dead 'fore I brought it back
Nigga you could call me mister starter cap
You be on that sucka shit cuffin
Her pop said he want his daughter back
You the wrong side of the track
You like an artifact
And I was probably sittin in class when I thought of that
It's a couple of different ways you make of it
And I'm chillin with...

[Saul Williams:]
Now is the essence of my domain
And it contains all that it was and will be
And I am as I always and will be
Cause I am and always will be that nigga
I am that nigga. I am that nigga
I am that nigga


[Intro:]
Uh
Yes
Vic!
Check, Look, Uh

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Uh-um, today was a good day
When I say you bad, girl I mean that in a good way
The winner is: yours truly
I will be ready when they give the awards to me
Congratulations
Tell em that I'm on till the next one
Till I get a buzz like my phone when a text come
All my niggas in it, the music only reflects them
And so I am doing deals until I get a couple to select from
Yeah, this is on behalf of my team
And the [?] I got in my duffle bag from supreme
And baby tell me that I don't be speaking and so it seem like I be thinking that I don't even know [?]
I'm in my own world, '94 Common shit
Don't compare me to niggas I have nothing in common with
I am the two three
The one [?]
Homecoming, drinking tequila, no mocking bird

[Hook:]
I'm a do it right (yeah), on my spring break shit
Shout out to the girls I'm kicking it at the lake with
Red cup sipping, burning L's by the pool house
Even when it's back in, I'm feeling like school's out
And I'm a do my own thing, so may the best man win
Nigga, may the best man win
Man, I fell the fuck out then I woke up gone
And now I'm working til tonight when I'm a do it again
Let's get it

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Somebody tell 'em Hyde Park is the home base
I'm swinging for the stands, bout to run this shit
Blowing up, they say I'm the bomb on some hundreds shit
Throwing up the brainiac as if I couldn't stomach it
Give your girl a heat stroke, hotter than the summer get it
I don't have to make 'em go, I got that shit they come and get
A Chicago McDonald's, I'm posted up in the front of it
Save Money nigga, get a Chase card
Double O, I'm riding on the track like a race car
See the way I'm putting words together like I ain't got a space bar
A Chicagorilla from the jungle where the apes are
Boy, I said I'm coming out swingning, put your guards up
Time for these candy ass rappers to get they bars up
Gotem rocking with it, my nigga, turn the guitars up
Shooting for the moon, a nigga wetting the stars up
Shots fired, nah I'm in it till the end
I'm a see 'em at the finish line, I'm going for the win (for the win)

[Hook:]
I'm a do it right (yeah), on my spring break shit
Shout out to the girls I'm kicking it at the lake with
Red cup sipping, burning L's by the pool house
Even when it's back in, I'm feeling like school's out
And I'm a do my own thing, so may the best man win
Nigga, may the best man win
Man, I fell the fuck out then I woke up gone
And now I'm working til tonight when I'm a do it again
Let's get it

[Outro:]
[Group of Girls:]
Fuck bitches, save money [x8]
Nigga
Fuck bitches save money
And if you don't know now you know nigga!
Ah! This is so fucking fun!
[Vic Mensa:]
When I'm getting bread, put the hollow head to they head
Getting bread up in the Chi

We getting bread up in the Chi, what?
We getting bread up in the Chi (getting bread up in the Chi)
Bread up in the Chi
We getting bread up in the Chi [x2]

Getting bread up in the Chi


Yeah, uh
They ain't ready nigga
They ain't ready uh-uh
Well, they ain't ready nigga ah
They ain't ready uh-uh [x3]

[Vic Mensa:]
Let me begin with an introduction
Tickets and I don't know what you waiting for
These niggas sittin on they shine, I'm about to take it though
And Rio got the recipe but I'm about to make it though
Girl that shit look good but I'd rather just see you naked though
Just striptease, take it off
Go and have you take it off
Hit it then I kit-kat the contact, break it off
I just tell em hit me on my line as soon as they get off
I don't pick the phone up, I just pull the Petron up
I blow it by the O so if you smokin' put a zone up
Comin out that city with them gang signs thrown up
It's Hyde Park up in this ho, put that on Obama
When they comin' with the cannon [?]
They ain't ready uh-uh
Well they ain't ready for the summer
Bout to get it by the boatload, who came up in the chokehold
I'm hot but I'm so cold, I'm freezin to the touch
Balls playin so address me as such, it's Mr. Clutch

[Hook:]
Lights out, l-l-lights out, lights out
Lights out, l-l-lights out, lights out
Lights lights out, lights lights out out
Lights lights out, lights lights out out (niggas!) [x2]

I'm steppin' in this bitch shinin, black shades
Now you see me now you don't
I ain't takin suggestions but I'm a give em what they want
I'm ridin like the UPS, got the package in the trunk
Speedin like I hit a stain
Smellin like I hit a skunk
Lights out
Bottom bunk
Bottoms up
Drivin drunk
Ridin dirty than a pitch, bumpin that new Christian Rich
I'm west like the Wicked Witch, kill a beat then dig a ditch
Bigger market, bigger niche
Ball bigger, bigger pit
They want the hits and I'm a knock em out the park
Lil Vic keep a Bic but I'm hot without the spark
Steppin out that all black it's like I'm hopping out the dark
I'm in this mother wiled up like a motherfucking narc
I'm on my south side, south side shit what you need
Come and run with me baby and let me bring you up to speed
Said is Victor gonna blow spark then I'm gonna bleed
On chief fuckin Indian beed, I keep it trilla like

[Hook]


Girl, girl girl

It's like this and like that and like this and uh [x4]
Man girl I said I'm likin the way that you do, do what you do
Do, do what you do
Do, do what you do

I'm caught in between a rock and a hard place
I wish that I could see the future
Where do you go when suit and tie doesn't even suit you
Remember back in grade school I used to be the moocher
Now I got my own bread, sleepin on the stone bed
Fell out on the floor with my phone dead
Moms keep callin me
Tell her what I'm doing it's finna require all of me
I put my soul in it, take a walk in my shoes
It's no tire like a flip-flop, you win or you lose
I'm under pressure like the bottom of the ocean
Smokin on the purple, sippin on the potion
Loud got a nigga rotatin in slow motion
I got my money up like I just got a promotion
A nigga represent like a union
Sippin wine like communion
I'm with all of my brothers, it's like a family reunion
I can't wait till the day we cuttin cake
Smokin good, eatin steak
Couple bitches by the lake, now make it shake

[Hook:]
I like the way you do it
I like the way you do it
I like the way you do it
Don't stop, don't stop [x2]

I'm countin sand through the hourglass
Burnin my reefer watchin the time fly
Life is a vision, I see the mission through my mind's eye
Could have been a nigga that you get your shoes shined by
Instead I'm with bitches that lame niggas get declined by
[?]
Pregnant with the Ls, waitin on some nine months shit
And snake niggas I would no longer smoke blunts with
Can all eat a fucking dick
Get a fork and knife, may I pop the cork, the life
Is better when it's seasoned
I'm from the city where we grind hotter when it's freezin
And in the heat, niggas hides get cold
Where young niggas don't get to grow old
Homie I'm in my mold
You know my MO, shoppin with no demo
Niggas look like they ain't get the memo
Get with the program, your boy bout to take it to the top
Said the city gon stop when I drop
(Chi city)

[Hook x3]


[Verse 1:]
To whom it may concern I roll another L and let the paper burn
Boy I'm bout to put on my signal I need to take a turn
See I be tryna tell em' but it's hard to make em learn
The white man run the ballers too, David Stern
Kindergarten teacher had me twisted
Had me up in that slow class
Didn't know that I was gifted
I bet they mad they missed it cause that youngin' bout to blow up
And they gon' want me down when they see a nigga throw up
Her feet up in the air man I got yo daughter toe up
Have her smokin' until she stupid and her drinkin'
Until she throw up
Annotate Now whose to blame
The game chose me I didn't choose the game
I can only take away your perception of it I can't remove the pain
It's hard to accept the money and then refuse the fame
Now I feel like Etta James
Take it I'm not losin' fame
Go get a brain
Nigga lose the chain
Cause that's that goofy ass shit that be makin'
Most of you losers lame
A lotta dudes the same I know that I'm different
Cause even in the middle of it I be feelin' distant
Everything's changin' on you it's hard to be consistent
Workin' by myself no assistant
Kids These Days is like a movement in the making
So if you think I'm playin' yo amusement is mistaken
Niggas word to Jay they think the music is amazing
And we just be chillin' with our people proofin' in the basement
I'm a fly guy
Burn the turbine fuel soon as a nigga fly by
Chilling when I step in the science
Captain Sci-Fi
Workin' on my touch like I'm on somebodies Wi-Fi
But need my own box like muay thai
Feed on the router I'm in my room up on my macbook
Was on the streets while you was hittin' the black book
Watch my front girl
I'll tell you how yo back look
The mission is to change more lives than crack took
I'm back on the block
I know it's wrong but we all go through it
Fightin' my subliminal tellin' me dawg don't do it
Told myself I needed my space
Then logged onto it
It was love like Jessica Huet
Until I blew it

[Verse 2:]
And I blew it too
God I'm only tryna' do what you would do
So why we split up for her like two and two
I know I been an underage drinker and a truant too
But when you comin' up in the city shit can influence you
I don't blame it
But they shoot it before they aim it
Hit a rapper tell a lie and entertain it
That shit is for the birds like bread crumbs
A Bakery deliver how the bread comes
Drunk off murder sippin the red rums
Black sky
Mother lamenting over her dead son
You ask why
The bullet wound from which a nigga bled run
For hours for the law even decide to show they face
Now they closin' up the casket like they bout to close the case
But fuck it
That's the reason we get high is for escape
But when you runnin' from your problems man it's hard to win a race
See they tell you the with you playins' what brought you in yo place
But I'm permanent and I'm too hard to erase
Listen to the whispers

[Outro: Aja Monet]
To whom it may concern
You're a negro spiritual
Your touch is magic
Got me feeling mystical
A [?] my spirit cause you
Got me in the physical
We can be holy scripture
The metaphor is so biblical that eyes are watching God
Yeah I see you youngin'
Got a thing or two to learn about lovin'
Too many of these kids is just out here fuckin'
Let a fly grown women teach you something
Welcome to school
Heres a life lesson
Love her like an instrument cause she's a blessing
When you call on God remember she's his saxophone
Her heart beats His favorite ringtone
Did you know black love was political?
Hip-Hop was libation ritual
Flashbacks of us holding hands through the middle passage
You still stuck in class trynna' pass this
Let's be under the panther act and raise some cubs
Thinking about carrying on the Legacy of us
Cha-town
I'm from the city that never sleeps
Never thought your skyline can make me weak to the knees it's the
Essence of your presence I can hardly speak got a
Poet at a loss for words
Treated
In the audience front seated
I'm drunk off the moonshine of your design got me retreating to collect myself
Cross my legs I'm just trynna' protect myself
The greatest weapon is your heart
The last man I loved was a shot in the dark
We get so uncomfortable with silence distracted by the screams then resort to violence
Hear the whistle of the soul as it bleeds
Hear the hunger of a man as he feeds
Know the plant can't grow without watering the seeds
When it gets quiet remember it's me
Listening to the whispers


[Man 1:] What up foe?
[Man 2:] Maintainin', God
[Man 1:] Damn, your ass been flexin' hard as hell, shorty. You got the Range? You ain't got no job
[Man 2:] Listen here, nigga, don't say shit, aight? That nigga Vic left his Amex
[Man 1:] Word?
[Man 2:] Mothafuckas cracked his card
[Man 1:] Yeah, what y'all get?
[Man 2:] What didn't we get? PlayStation 4, AirBnBs, smart TVs, dumb TVs, ATVs, Air Force 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s and them ain't even out yet. 10 pairs of Gucci flip flops, a Gucci stroller, a Moncler for D-Block's dog. Bought a chain from his jeweler, studio time, a Young Chop beat, a Backwoods forever, Robin jeans, some jeans from a robin, bunch of birds - parrots, parakeets, gluten free Harold's, 10 gallons of mild sauce, a hundred long fashion shirts. And the crazy part is, we set it all up to make it look like that mothafucka [beep:] did it


Coffee and cigarettes
Remind me of you, babe
You pick me up in your old Buick station wagon
With the radio broke
I roll the window up
You turn the AC on
Who knew you'd be so cold?
Newports burnin' on our lips
A shootout in the background as I told you that I love you
A gunshot to the heart couldn't have hit me as hard as you did
As hard as you did, no
Ash my cigarette
Waitin' for your response
It burns slowly as a spirit
Who knew you'd be so cold?

You were only 17, fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

We wrote our names beneath the bridge
To be sure that the city never forgot us
Who woulda known you'd be so quick to forget about me
I guess that's memory loss
I wish you loved me as much as weed
Shit, even half as much as weed
I know you love to smoke
Marlboro 27s were your favorite
Only thing you loved more was your little sister
I hope she never grows up to be as fucked up as you did
Fucked up as you did, oh
Light my cigarette like we did when we were young
Who knew we'd grow so old?

You were only 17, fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

I recently realized I'm a hopeless romantic
I ask a lot of questions, but I'm not open to answers
And all of my girlfriends just fall into the same old patterns
Like sudoku puzzles we cross words, spoken in anger
I must be the best at turnin' the good girl crazy, that's like my strong suit
'Cause every time we should be breakin' up I'm right there on cue
Like a pool stick with some bullshit 'bout what I'm goin' through
You should have an amber alert for me, I swear they should have warned you
I mean, young rap God, what do you expect from me?
And women are like a greatest hits album, they get the best of me
I give 'em my all and then forget to call the next morning
I used to play my tape in the passenger while she bend corners
She was only 17, first girl that broke my heart
Now I think I take it out on every girl I take out on
Dinner dates, to somewhere nice to sit like Rosa Parks
Guess that's just the way it is, it all ends the way it starts

You were only 17, fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me


[Vic Mensa:]
This is dedicated to all the pretty girls
(Just the pretty girls?)
And the ugly girls too! (Alright)
To me you pretty anyway baby
Didn't I treat you right girl? (Didn't I)
Didn't I give you everything? (Didn't I)
Didn't I do the best I could? (Didn't I)
I tried my best just to be a man (Didn't I)
Victor, turn down the music
You have school tomorrow
You're spending too much time in the studio
It's too much

Didn't I tell you we was gone make it to the top nigga?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I tell you this was the new birth of the Roc, nigga?
Didn't I, didn't I
Say I didn't
Send you that money when ya' needed it 'cause you my nigga
Didn't I, didn't I
Say I didn't
Didn't I take off the morning just to ride with ya', yeah

This feel like a rebirth, another day on this green Earth
I couldn't ask for much more man, shit could be worse
A fresh pair of jeans, a nice clean shirt
I'm on my island in the sun shout out to Weezer
Who can you count on these days in 2017
Lil' nigga, big city, bigger dreams
I copped a house out in the hills just to switch scenes
And now they back home saying "How could Vic leave?"
I got Chicago on my mind like I'm Ray Charles
Georgia, promise I'll be faithful
I know I missed some action, I've been AWOL
I can't smoke witchu everyday, I ain't Nate Dogg
I put you up in my crib when you lost your granny house
You never gotta thank me for that man that's family talk
I stayed in the studio, I took the Grammys off
And put my soul in this shit like I'm Diana Ross
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Tell you Joey Purp was finna get the whole city high (purple!)
When you had your daughter I was by your side then she
Took her first breaths watched my niece came alive
I jumped on the first plane when Nikko dad died
I could see him through the window, he was flying through the sky
Looking down on you, proud of you
This is for Mr. Washington, I told you we was finna show out for you

Didn't I tell you, you was gone see us at the top nigga?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I tell you this was the new birth of the Roc, nigga?
Didn't I, didn't I
Say I didn't
Cop you them plane tickets to fly out, 'cause you my nigga
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I take off the morning just to ride with ya', yeah

After the dark comes the sunset
Tell the ones you love "You might only get one chance"
I would give it all back before you slip away from me
That's just what you mean to me
That's just what you mean to me

I know that I don't call like I should, I hope that everything's good
And Mom's doing well at that school in Kenwood
And Lizzie's still happy up at Ballet Memphis
I know she would've been at Grandma's funeral if she could
I rarely share my problems with ya but I'm glad to have a father figure
I know I grew up more blessed than a lot of niggas
A lot of niggas' pops is like lottery tickets
They bet on them but never get to hear their number call up
Coming home soon as the summer's on
I took the winter off in L.A. 'cause the city's too cold
But I'm heating up, soon as I drop the album
We on an island like Friday in Robinson Crusoe
Hit the town with my old man, make him feel young again
I know he proud of that tattooed son of his
All them tears I put you through when I was a kid
Calls from the police station when I was hustling
You used to hate to hear the phone ring now you can't wait to Hear the phone ring
Ain't that a beauti-ful thing
Thanksgiving pull up with my Beamer and my gold chain
I know I tootin' my own horn like Coltrane
But didn't I, didn't I tell you 'bout your baby boy?
I used to rock the wife beater like baby boy
And now I'm suit and tied up without a day in court
Picked the house out, I put up the down payment for it
I caught the first plane when I heard your mama died
I seen her through the window she was flying in the sky
Looking down on you, proud of you
This is for my Grandma, told you we would show out for you

Didn't I tell you, you was gone see us at the top mama?
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I tell you this was the new birth of the Roc, mama?
Didn't I, didn't I
Say I didn't
Jump on the first plane to fly out to see my mama
Didn't I, didn't I
Say I didn't
Didn't I take off the morning just to slide on ya', yeah

[Ty Dolla $ign & Vic Mensa:]
After the dark comes the sunset
Tell the ones you love "You might only get one chance"
I would give it all back before you slip away from me
That's just what you mean to me
That's just what you mean to me


Yea, I know you down for some ignorance, down

By your mama address, watch out
Rock you right to sleep, watch out
Like a little baby

[Vic Mensa:]
Gotta keep a strap on me like straight jacket, bitch I might go crazy
Tuck your scary ass in bed I'd like to sing to you a little ghetto lullaby
Grab your gun and light a blunt and pop a pill and put a middle finger in the sky
Two niggas in a black Toyota with a strap that's loaded and I can't control 'em
Ready for a game of Texas Hold'Em
Meaning they ain't no joker and they poke ya for that white Sammy Sosa
Catch you lackin' on your granny's sofa
Home alone and he 'bout to roll up
He don't know we about to roll up

Up for revenge and I'm down for some ignorance
Run up in his crib, lay down all the witnesses
Finna take a ride and we packing it's a business trip
Me with the cannon in my hand can you picture this

Hide my pain in the past, behind my face in this mask
Foot to the gas, buck on the dash
I might Spaz on your goof ass
Don't make me blast, shit come off safe
If you don't open the safe
Totin' an eight, open the door
Open his face, with this vase
Blood on the carpet, no conscience
Beat a nigga like a 808, so heartless
Ran out the back door of the apartment
Stash the bloody gloves in the garbage
These nightmares turn us into monsters
Memories on 47th street haunt us
You a ghost
Fuck around with them fuck arounds
You can fuck around and get smoked

Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance

[Joey Purp:]
Niggas on ya head (watch out)

They know where you live (watch out)
They gon' catch you while you leavin'

[Vic Mensa (Joey Purp):]
(Is that a face in the staircase, bitch I might be tweaking')
Listen to the voices in my head
Welcome to my fucked up reality
Ever since you did that home invasion
'Cause the universe can feel ya energy
Mentally ill, fuck Dr. Phil
All these pills ain't Benadryl (Chiraq)
No oil but it's been a drill
Let me show you how the jungle feel
Lions, tigers, bears (oh my)
Tryna dodge the feds (watch out)
If the National Guard was actually hard they wouldn't be scared (southside)
And these kids grew up with no moms and no dads
Blew up with these rhymes and notepads
Even if they did they'd dump heads
One a one way street to nowhere
Everything to prove, with nothing to lose
You fools at Fox News
Couldn't walk a block in our shoes
They'll lay you down

[Vic Mensa:]
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Get 'em


[Vic Mensa:]
This for all my niggas that ever got caught up fuckin' with two
'Cause it's too hard to say no

[Vic Mensa & Syd:]
I know, I know, I know
'Cause he gorgeous
She caught you, I know
Fuckin' in the bathroom, in my home
Call me selfish, but I want you both
And that's what makes it so damn hard to let you go
'Cause girl you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
She not ugly, I want you to know
That you're gorgeous, oh yeah

[Vic Mensa:]
I don't wanna fuss or fight, not tonight
Let's catch a flight, get fly tonight
I'll be your pilot, get high tonight
You wanna own me like copyright
But shootin' stars so hard to hold down
Red bottles, red carpet, we paint the whole town
Call concierge, forgot to put a condom on
But shit it's the Mondrian Hotel
Get you an Asian provocateur
She got expensive taste in lingerie
She say it's too hard to keep it
Oops, we just dropped Victoria Secret
It's like that
Might add, quite an ass, I might add
But she can detect a bitch from an eyelash
I know I was wrong, that was my bad
She had a pumpkin ass, how could I not smash?
You don't gotta hold that against me
I just wanna hold that against me
Grab you Giv-en-chy, I mean Givenchy
Then she seen my side piece in the front seat, uh oh
Nigga who the hell is this? Here we go
Why you gotta turn up everywhere we go?
How my ex turn up everywhere we go?
It ain't my fault that I want you both

[Vic Mensa & Syd:]
'Cause you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
Shit got ugly, I want you to know
That you're gorgeous, oh yeah

[Vic Mensa:]
We can't stop, we so addicted
Unconditional prescriptions
Keep me from these crazy bitches
Sittin' there, see somethin' vicious
Break in my house and you steal my car
After all that and you still my broad
I'll beat a nigga ass 'bout you, on God
Tell my new girl, better stay on guard
All in the store tryna go O-Dog
Poppin' at the sales clerk in a lil' skirt
Talkin' 'bout she looked at me wrong
You must be high, what drugs are you on?
Whatever it is, you got me hooked
Whatever it is, you got my new girl shook
First you wanna break somethin', then you wanna make love
Pshhh... ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
Halfway home and my phone blowin' up
Paranoid, I don't wanna open it up
'Cause I be textin' these hoes too much
If she see her name, she get Goku tough
So I just keep it on silent, keep on ridin'
Shorty gon' keep on wildin'
But when you smile it makes it all okay

[Vic Mensa & Syd:]
'Cause you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
I don't wanna love you so fuckin' bad
But you're gorgeous

[Vic Mensa:]

You're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous, you're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous


[Vic Mensa:]
Do the realest niggas die young?
A question for the gun that killed my nigga Cam a.k.a. DARE
How's life up there?
Do you still laugh like crashing trains?
Do you tag your name on angel wings?
I don't know how time works in Heaven, but it's been a minute
Write me back
Lil' Vic

[The-Dream:]
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
(Yeah, Cam what up bro?)

[Vic Mensa:]
What up Cam?
It's your little bro
It's been a while since we spoke but it's hidden fo'
The other day I saw your sister bro
Sad it had to be at another funeral
That was a wild summer, same one that took Rod from us
When I heard they stabbed him in his side
Swear to God I could feel that shit in my stomach
Yo, I heard it was some niggas from the Wild 100s
That sneaky bitch set you up man
Fuck man that shit was tough man
Over some petty ass weed
I was like anybody but Cam
I called Autumn immediately
Needed someone to feed it to me
I couldn't stomach it on my own
I wanted to throw up like I was chuggin' patron
Every time I run through your number in my phone
I think about bullet holes runnin through your dome
I just saw you that week on 53rd
I'm tearing up man it's hard to put this shit in words
It's like Macklemore at the Grammys, man
I just feel like you got some shit you didn't deserve
You was a good nigga, but the good niggas always die young, fucking 'round with them hood niggas
I know you had your hands in that dirt, but
They ain't have to air you out outside that Kenwood Liquors
Now shit'll never ever be the same for me
None of this money takes my pain from me
But still for whatever it's worth
I'm just writin' you this letter
Send it to heaven on earth

[The-Dream:]
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth

[Vic Mensa:]
What up lil' Vic?
It's your big bro
It's been a while man, what's good though?
I see you on the road like 10-4
I ain't surprised I knew you was gonna kill em tho
I heard your song "Holy Holy"
That shit really touched me
You was just a little bony homie
To see you in front of thousand of people, screaming my name, man that shit did a lot for me
Sometimes heaven gets lonely
I talked to your grandma, she said "Tell Vic I'm proud for me"
I got that little liquor you poured out for me
I was drinking it with Rod, I know that you miss him
You really need to keep your squad closely, I mean Joey, Kene, Smoko, Towkio
You know? Your ride or die homies
'Cause to be honest them other niggas is all phony
But you know you got to stay off them drugs man, they no good for you
I see you in that bathroom stall suicidal with that gun in hand
How could you wanna die? Shit is so good for you
Heaven ain't that bad though
Just a lot of sunny days, mad dope
I smoked with Kurt Cobain yesterday, he said he liked your shit
And to tell you that you on the right path though
Don't cry, I'mma see you when it's time
And it ain't time yet, so keep on your grind
Keep your mind on your money
And your money on your mind
Cause trust me you're gonna get through the worst
Sincerely Killa Cam
From Heaven on Earth

[The-Dream:]
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth
This could be
Heaven right
Here on Earth, Here on Earth

[Vic Mensa:]
What up young Vic?
You don't know my name
I'm just another nigga caught up in the street game
I been through things, seen things
I know this might sound crazy but let me explain
It was a dark night, I got call from this broad right
She said I'm hittin you about this shit
Because I know you got stripes like off white
I got a lick for you, you got a car right?
You leaving for my crib in an hour
Hold on one sec, he just got out the shower (Who you talking to?)
Nothin' I'm just talkin' to my momma
Now listen close, I can't talk no louder
He got 10 pounds in the trunk
He's bout to make a run to drop the Benz off to the plug
You could get him robbed for the cash if you quick
And I know he ain't strapped because I just hid his gun
I asked her who the nigga was she ain't say a name
But I just had a baby man I had to make some change
I was hurt, how could I turn away a stain
So I called up my brothers like Damon Wayans
We piled up in my Monte Carlo, pulled up to the bitch crib
Seen a white Ford Explorer shorty just told me to follow
He was sittin on 75th, he bent off Stony and made a stop at the Kenwood Liquors
He ran inside to get a drink
And when he stepped out he had a bottle of hennessy in his hand
We rolled up and put that banger to his face
"Give me everything in the car, nigga everything"
He start stumbling like "I-I ain't got anything"
I said "Shut the fuck up man, open the trunk up man
Before I gotta let this hammer bang"
He reached for the keys and put him in
The trunk popped open seen the weed in Saran
I said step the fuck back, he ain't listen though
I saw his hand reaching again
I was scared, I ain't gon lie
That's what it was
I thought he had a gun, my eyes went black
I let two shots go (two gunshots)
Before I knew it, he was layin in the ground in a puddle of blood
I know it ain't right
I think about it every night
I ain't even mean to take his life
We livin in the streets where ain't shit free and your man just had to pay the ultimate price
A week later I saw your post on the 'Gram
R.I.P DARE with a picture of him
I recognized the face from somewhere and then I realized
Damn


[Saul Williams:]
The metaphor of the bird is eternal
[Vic Mensa:]
As I stood in the bathroom with a 9 millimeter in my mouth
Empty Henny bottle on the couch
The mirror in front of me reflected everything I hated in those around me
I felt like a hypocrite
I wanted to fly away from it all
The lies, the betrayal, the rage I felt
To turn every page I'd ever written into flames and let it burn

[The-Dream:]
This is what it sounds like
The streets cry
When the streets cry
I'm startin' to think that this is all my fault
Niggas under them hoodies, we above the law
How could I think that we wouldn't get judged at all?
Always in the club when them guns go off
Layin' under that preacher when he talk that talk
My mother is thinkin', where did it all go wrong?
Father thinkin' if he spent more time I coulda played ball

The pain won't inspire, things we lost in the fire
Things we lost in the fire
The things we lost in the fire
Hope this pain will inspire, the things we lost in the fire (fire)
Yeah, yeah
The things we lose in the fire (yeah)
Oh, oh


[Vic Mensa:]
She said everything you say is a lie
I text you and you never reply
Sometimes I wish I woulda been with a regular guy
All these years and you gon' string me on like that?
Like a puppet and Gepetto when you know I'mma snap
You don't understand the power that you have to affect me
Could use it for good, but you'd rather neglect me
You keep pulling me back like a Chinese finger trap
I try to let go, but you just won't let me
I guess that she could sense the sex in the morning
Judging by the way she kept texting and calling
Phone blowing up, you say you never ignore me
She found a rubber in the crib
She got the evidence on me, damn

And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And still I opened the door, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker

She flipped the kitchen table and broke a water glass
Screamed, "Bitch, come out here, I'm coming for yo ass"
I screamed back like, "Please stay in the bathroom
Whatever you do, do not leave the bathroom"
She in the room, ass out like a baboon
Looking extra hot like a vacay in Cancun
My girl tryna swing on a nigga with a damn broom
Now look at the mess we made, baby

And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And I opened the door, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker
Damn, the wifey and a homewrecker
Who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker
Shit

I knew you was crazy, I knew you was crazy, but goddamn
Who'd've ever thought we'd take it this far
We like to get drunk and get pissed off, but this, dog?
My chick start ringing every buzzer on the wall
Fienin' on a nigga like an addict in withdrawals
My other chick hiding in the bathroom in her drawers
And me, I'm the middle just like Malcolm in the hallway
Like, "Please, don't pull a fuckin' stove out the wall, babe
I knew you was crazy, I knew you was crazy"
She said, "You don't know what you do to me, baby"
I say, "I do," she say, "You don't," I say, "Let go," she say, "I won't"
Now we wrestlin' in the kitchen, "How the hell you get so strong?"
She pull the dressers out the cabinet, all the knives fell on the floor, whoa
I drive you crazy, but you love that shit
I'm looking down at the knives, "Please, don't cut that bitch
I mean, she ain't know I was yo nigga"
[Pounding on door] (Open up!)
She like, "It's time to go, nigga, peace"
And then police come in the crib, looking all out the window
And shorty come out the bathroom, mad as a schitzo
I wanna speak to her, but as a minority
I had to hide the weed first, that's a priority
It feels like Love & Hip-Hop should be recording me
10 minutes later and we acting so cordially
I got shorty a car, you came back to the door
I knew we hit rock bottom as we laid on the floor

And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And I made it happen, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker
Damn, the wifey and a homewrecker
Who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy

[Rivers Cuomo:]
A homewrecker, a homewrecker
I wanna go back
A homewrecker, a homewrecker
A homewrecker, I wanna go back
A homewrecker


Memories, memories

Oh
I am the first son of Betsy and Edward Mensah
Made love and made a legend, Woodlawn and 47th
Gunshots outside my window, drug deals out by the Citgo
But mama always made sure the tooth fairy found my pillow
My pops was always workin', he put the family first
Chicago Saturdays in the park and Sundays at church
Kept me from off the corner where Stones and GDs was warrin'
And Kings and BDs and VLs all had dreams of bein' Jordan
Even dope fiends was scorin', swish, tryna be like Mike
Shootin' through that baseline in their veins tryna reach that height
I was a little rockstar, dressed up like Jimi Hendrix
In Hyde park in the good part in the hood like Hemi engines
Teachers didn't see my vision, had me in IEPs
Kicked out of kindergarten, they didn't know that I was me
Tattooed my tears, wrote my story in my skin
Because even as a boy I always knew I'd be the man

In my dreams (In my dreams)
I saw it in my sleep (yeah)
The city will be mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
Memories
On 47th street (yeah)
Sebastian got me high
One day it will be mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine

At age 12 I learned the difference between white and black
Police pulled me off of my bike, I landed on my back
Back to reality, oops, a victim of gravity
Where they pull you down and keep you there
Dependin' on how you keep your hair
Now it's fuck 'em up and bumpin nothin' but NWA
Smokin' a 7 or an 8th, way before 7th grade
My classmates sellin' yay
Sebastian got me high that first time
In the back of an abandoned truck by Webster Place
Couldn't feel my face
Sprayin' paint to see my name on trains, try not to catch a case
Age 13 at Cam granny house, watchin' him shoot up the Ace
He took the needle out and waved it in my face
If I ain't tell that boy, "Be easy, dog," I coulda died of AIDS
I started realizin' my talents 'bout the time I was 15
Tryna take over the world like Pinky and the Brain
Sellin' kush and hittin' stains, still in True Religion jeans
16, I was shinin' just like a Stanley Kubrick scene
Sneakin' into Lollapalooza, I fell off of that bridge
15, 000 volts went through my elbow, fell over 30 feet
The doctor said I should be dead, still alive and still ain't scared
In the hospital bed, writin' these rhymes in my head

In my dreams (In my dreams)
I saw it in my sleep (yeah)
The city will be mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine
Memories
On 47th street (yeah)
Sebastian got me high
One day it will be mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine, all mine

In a land of desperation we often turn to self medication as a coping mechanism. Some make a living as hood pharmacists while some just inhale to remove them from hell. I watched from the window of a gated community until I grew old enough there was no immunity from allure of the life


Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

It wasn't easy but I learned the hard way and let me tell you how
Lived life and learned my lessons
Spent dough and earned my blessings
Southside my tatted necklace
Ball like I'm ambidextrous
Every time they tried to block me
Switched hands and changed directions
Fist in the air like Rocky
Bitch I think my name Sylvester
That's the difference between me and them
When they thought it was the end, I was still tryna see a M
Now the difference 'tween me and them
Even in Mercedes Buick, I was still tryna see a Benz
I was backed into a corner
Sat chasing, catching charges
It's re-election season
Bitch I think I'm back in office
You don't know my pain
How far I've came
Those days are gone
You cursed my name
I prayed to God he shined the sun
He gave me rain
I took that water and walk on it
Marching harder than million Martins
On my darkest days, I'm still a star; I shine regardless

Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

And I thought they said light skin niggas went out of style
AndrÃ© 3k said you only funky as your last cut
So I'm state to state, and I move like a Mac truck
Plus I gotta keep a Mac tucked
For these vid soldier niggas on the 'Gram trying act tough
Y'all too alternative get your facts up, I shoot to kill
And my stacks up
I get pounds [?] english, bitch I think I'm bout to wreck up
You don't get do you?
When you on the big screen, a lot of little people living through you
And if you don't stick to the script
They assassinate your character and act like they never knew you
That's just how the game goes I guess
I dress like project runway meets the projects
Write like Noah but a little more Complex
I fed niggas and they shitted on me
Took the piss out me and spilt on me
When I broke down like Britney Spears
Said they throw me-oops they never did it on me
So I wrote 'em out and made a bigger story
Vic's story that's victory
Niggas never did shit for me
Show them the ropes and jumped ship on me
But I never drowned
Stayed down, sang songs for my home town
Made homes for the broke kids stepping over needles in the playground
Y'all the only thing that matters to me
If y'all love me fuck everybody
If y'all love me they could never stop me
If y'all love me they could never stop me

Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost
Through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now
I gave you my pain through pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin


[Vic Mensa:]
We could be free
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One thing I believe I could learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
And love could wash away our sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed
If it means, we'll make them better today not tomorrow

One day I dream of telling my momma
"You ain't gotta work no more"
Same for my father, born in Ghana, down on that dirt road floor
As far as he came I can't complain, but pain is so subjective
Spend so much time countin' issues, I forget to count
My blessings
Watch my cousins back at home, getting water out a well
While I watch my brother stacking stone, whippin' water by the scale
Tryna' get a mill' on the other side
They ain't got a meal, we don't recognize we in heaven
So we think we live in hell
It's been getting kinda hard to tell
But

Sometimes I wake up and I look up at the sky
Asking why I'm alive when the realest niggas died
And my pride won't let me give up, lord as hard as I try
In those times I try to remember

That we could be free
If we only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
One day, I believe I'd learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, truly
And love could wash away our sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed
If it means, we'll make them better today not tomorrow

I don't want to wait for the afterlife
I don't want a vigil by candle light
I don't want to be the new sacrifice
I don't want to turn into a poltergeist
Be a ghost at night full of broken dreams
Momma cryin' at an open casket
Cold as ice in a suit, 3 piece
All dressed up for Sunday masses
Pastor said put faith in God
But faith alone can't make things right
Who the fuck is you to patronize
Somebody's son whose daddy died?
Why they flood Baton Rouge?
Why the city singing Alton's blues?
Why, why, why, why?
I feel like Jadakiss every time I watch the news
What the fuck I got to lose?
So I'm down to bleed if it means things improve
You fools, saying "all lives matter"
But it's black lives you refuse include
Blocked from the polls
Locked in the hood, trying to stop you from voting and stop you from growing
And cops keep blowing and blowing
Keep black people locked into cotton
They don't want you to own, but

Sometimes I wake up and I look up in the sky
Asking why I survived all the days that I could have died
Who am I in my place
To contemplate suicide?
In those times I try to remember

That we could be free, truly
If we'd only knew we were slaves to the pains of each other
But I believe I'd learn
To see my enemy as my brother
Then we could be free, you and me
And we could wash away our sorrows
I'm not afraid to bleed, if it means
We'll make them better today not tomorrow

[Vic Mensa (Ty Dolla $ign):]
Love (love)
Love (love)
To love my enemy as my brother
(Yeah yeah yeah)
[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Make my enemy my brother
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Enemy my brother


[Vic Mensa (Pharrell Williams):]
(Wings, wings, wings)
P, this shit beautiful
(Spread my wings, wings, wings, spread my wings)
Just let me think about my life
(And fly, fly, fly, fly)
Where I wanna go, and where I been
(Fly, fly, fly)
Turn the headphones up

[Vic Mensa:]
Take me away from all the drama man, I miss the old days
With all of these backstabbers I feel like The O'Jays
I wanna open up my parachute but it's cold playing this role when you never been the type to role play
There's something about this game and it fucks with you mentally
Like football players leaving the league with traumatic brain injuries
And eventually, you'll never be the same as you were
Then you look back at your life and everything is a blur
Like did I really turn 23 and see a mill before 24?
Did I really blow it all like a hand grenade in the middle of a civil war?
Am I still down with the same niggas that I came in with? Do they value my friendship?
Or do they just love the attention?
Not to mention my girlfriends, what went wrong?
Did they do me too right?
Am I the same as the snakes? Is the past coming back to bite?
Did I waste too many days? Did I fight too many nights?
Will they love me when I die? Will I ever learn to fly?

[Pharrell Williams:]
Spread my wings (wings, wings)
Use my wings (wings, wings)
Spread my wings (wings, wings)
And fly (fly, fly, fly)
Fly
Fly
Fly
Use my wings

[Vic Mensa:]
Introduction to Victor, not Vic Mensa
The one you never meet in a XXL issue
I got so many issues, I should be my own publisher
The beat is my therapist, Skateboard, paint the picture
A portrait of the artist formally known as Vic
I read the signs I was close to overdose like Prince
Picking pill pieces up out of the bathroom sink
Like an armored truck ride in the rink
I'd probably be a vegetable if not for medical attention
My self destructive habits have me itching like Tyrone Biggums
In the cyclone of my own addiction
The voices in my head keep talking, I don't wanna listen
"You'll never be good enough nigga you never was
Nobody fucking needs you, you should just jump off the bridge
You hurt everyone around you, you impossible to love
I don't want you to live, I wish you were fucking dead
I wish you were never born, we would all be better for it
I don't love you I don't like you, like a fucking metaphor
Fuck everyone song you ever done, you lie to everyone
And ask them to tell the truth when that's something you never done
You a fucking embarrassment, how dare you win
Nigga, you let the devil in
You're still a drug addict, you're nothing without your medicine
Go and run to your sedatives, you can't run forever Vic"
Climb the tallest building and spread your wings

[Pharrell Williams:]
Spread my wings (wings, wings)
Use my wings (wings, wings)
Spread my wings (wings, wings)
And fly (fly, fly, fly)
Fly
Fly
Fly
Here's my

[Saul Williams (Vic Mensa):]
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
(The answer to the questions that wings are)
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
(The metaphor for birds is eternal)
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
(Spread my wings, and fly)
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky (spread your wings)
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky (spread your wings and fly)
Jumping, jumping, jumping, jumping
Falling, falling, falling to the sky
Good Evening


[Hook: Kenna]
I live in a daze, ridin' through the phase
Goin' out in a blaze and I blaze and I blaze
Lighting in the flames, burnin' in the raids
Goin' out in a blaze and I blaze and I blaze

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Starin' of the narrow-point reflection of myself
Questionin' what is my life to become?
I wonder if I'll ever be the man, my momma wish I was
Or will I end up victim to the hand of a gun?
Given the current circumstances I stand alone
No one to hold me but me, I mean it's hard not to be stressed
Stretchin' myself to the bone, can't feel my chest
I been heavin' cause all this smoke I been breathin' in just to not be depressed
All the pressures from record labels around me
In a benz still trynna sign me
Finally in a position to put all that shit behind me
How many mothers have a son they never know?
Nobody questions what they do, nobody wonders where they go
I'm goin' around in circles chasin' myself in contradiction
With a pistol to the back of my head
Prolly pull the trigger the moment after I make it big
Pretty white seats in the Lambo all plastered in red
My nigga, me? Naturally I forever be fly
It's in my blood, it has to be, how could I ever be not?
Ain't a question when and where cause I forever get mine
Stand in my way, that be the day they get a deputy shot
Goin' back? Fuck that. That used to be me
I used to be weak, we used to be thieves
Still my shoes for a second, think about it
Would you be me? What would you do? Fuck would you do?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Joey Purp]
Holla at your boy, it's Purple baby they label me
A problem and I probably am, so I don't knock 'em
How I pull up in that Caddy on trims? Clean chakras
With a Oscar-winning bitch, she got on door knockers
And I'm knocking down your door if it's war, partner
Deepak Purple, that boy conscious
Jack four Biancis, come back with a pound a
Broccoli like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like a IV, trynna be monogamous
But I got bitches on my dick like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
And I only promise this
To my little girl, I'm a bring you the world
Yo fuck that
Niggas love to talk, but that talkin' shit out the conversation
You young niggas gon' fuck up and start some complications
Your baby mothers, your cousins, grandmother's congregatin'
One more time and your fuckin' life confiscated
I seen good niggas die over less so how you trippin'?
A higher power sent you and your niggas on your mission?
The Muslims preach to the Jews to preach to the Catholics and Christians
My brother's serving a life sentence, nigga how you livin'?
My homie get it on the boat, nigga how you get it?
My momma usually like to snort, nigga how you feel it?
I asked him if it's easy to kill, he said hardly
Killed a nigga in the club, took the life out the party, huh?

[Hook]

[Break: Vic Mensa]
This is me at the end of the day
Forget the talkin', forget all of the lies and forget all of the cameras
Who's who and who's watchin'?
The water for my soul for the day I hit the coffin

[Outro x6: Vic Mensa]
Know I'm a get mine, I'm a get mine
I'm a get mine, I'm a get mine


Hold my phone. I was just like, and I was just lookin' in the sun and I was just like, man this shit is about havin' fuckin' fun. This shit is all about fun. All of this music shit, to me, I do this shit for fun man. It's a real ass hustle, for now, it's 100% real. We trynna turn it into a business, but it's about fun though, music man. Music is about fun, music is fun to me. I love it. More than fun it's about love. I need to just not forget that


[Intro:]
[Dan:] Yooo, Vic, whattup man? Yo, I'm just making sure, yo are you sleeping?
[Vic:] Huh, yeah...
[Dan:] What? Vic, the flight leaves at 7 - 30 man. Leavin' [?:] at the LAX

[Vic:] Alright I'm up, I gotchu, I'm up. I'm up. I'm finna just, just like lay back down for a second and shit, but I'm up though
[Dan:] Go, cause you're late, don't be late man. I need you to get on that plane. 7: 30 leaving O'Hare going to LAX

Hollywood, Los Angeles
Hollywood, Los Angeles
Hollywood, Los Angeles

[Verse 1:]
My footsteps in ashes
Why do I kill everything I touch?
Why do blood run so deep?
After so long why it mean so much
Shadows of a song, man it could've been a rap
Coulda wrapped up shit and said I'm never looking back
Took a backpack, packed everything I owned
Into it hopped onto a train, threw it on the track
I guess that's what I do, at least what I do best
I beg my pardon
Part from you girl, you the one that I do bless
With this holy water (holy water)
Gold rolly on him (Gold rolly on him)
Took a bubble bath with the preacher's daughter that's holy water
Could you imagine magic in the air
The passion while I'm passing Ls
Inhale smoke and laughing
Last lap of lux
Deluxe trucks and wagons
Y'all pass the dutch
I done puffed the dragon
Niggas be draggin ass and don't make shit
And they wonder why it don't make sense
Said it's been a while, they wonder where you been
I've been locked up in that basement
I was 16 with a mixtape
Now I'm 19 with a mixtape
Tryna be 21 with a million dollars
Like praise the Lord, hallelujah, holla

[Hook:]
Would you dance with me in the rain?
Would you share your empathy, kill my pain?
Paint this picture for me
I'll be by ya maÃ±ana
When you need me I'm gone call ya
Call my baby, Natalia
You the reason, wonder why my feet don't touch the ground
Wonder why my feet don't touch the ground
I'll be by ya maÃ±ana
When you need me I'm gone call ya
Call me crazy, ooh mama, marijuana
Wonder why my feet don't touch the ground
Wonder why my feet don't touch the ground

Hollywood, Los Angeles
Hollywood, Los Angeles
Streets of gold and good cannabis
But ooh I know you so scandalous

[Verse 2:]
Hollywood Los Angeles, Hollywood Los Angeles
Streets of gold and good cannabis but ooh I know you so scandalous
Scared to leave but still scared to stay
Staying content disappearing away
Would you rather fade out filled with regret
Or put a gun to your head
Take it out with a bang
Suicide letter, signed Kurt Cobain
Suicide letter, signed Kirko Bangz
Drank in my cup while I'm cutting my wrists
Because all these rap niggas all sound so same
I'm going to stay this just one last time
This one last thing
People are sheep to the radio heard it don't take too much to make a dumb ass sing
Sing along with me, sing along this your jawn
Ladies this your favorite song
In the mirror, put this on
Hit your zan, get in your zone
I can tell I see she know
But she know she don't need no more
She been drinking way too much
I must admit you way too cold
I caught you looking across that room
You wrong you think that I don't know
Your girlfriend probably played that roll
Like 'I know you seen his type before'
That's neither here nor there
But I will say this cause I do know that
You're the only one that I need that's fact
And the fact of the matter is I got your back

[Hook]


[Intro: Vic Mensa]
Cam, whattup bro?
Rest in peace Killa Cam

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I been smokin' that can't you tell, I'm high as hell
Hide my pain, but I hide it well, die for thinkin' like Galileo
Posted with my homies, brosky rollin' OZs
Hope this stogie that we smoking help me fake forget I'm lonely
Lonely Massachusetts, on the road no roadies
Wrote this song inside my notebook, toke this tunchi think of Tony
He was only 20, took one in the tummy
Caught a bullet to the backbone by the hand of his own homie
Holy Jesus holy holy
Holy Jesus holy holy
Holy Jesus holy holy
Holy Jesus holy holy

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Who can see the future? We may never know it
Sweets and kama sutra, swisher swisher would you blow it?
Who can see the future? We may never know it
Sweets and kama sutra, swisher swisher would you blow it?
If the world ends tomorrow
If the world ends tomorrow, would you smoke with me?
If the world ends tomorrow
If the world ends tomorrow, would you smoke with me?

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Call your grandma, go light this L, go post bro bail
Hate to spend your last night in jail, make a plan and try to make amends
Or maybe take a stand and tell how you feel
Sentimental recollection, revelation, resurrection, God, question
What would people think about if I died?
I wonder sometimes if this music I
Make would keep me alive
But what if my tape never dropped or my album had flopped
Or I stopped at a red light and a semi-truck ran into my ride
What would my obituary column be?
How would they color me in the media? Wikipedia follow me
Would you follow my failures or mail your family apologies?
Like, sorry for your loss, like they the one that lost
Well I'm watchin' from the side like a six man
Feelin' like Marlon Wayans but without the white chicks man
I remember when they killed Killa Cam on Stoney
Got it tattooed on my wrist in memory of my big homie

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
See these the type of records make me think about Alori
It kills me inside we can't hear her side of the story
I kept my Metro PCS with all of our text messages
As evidence that I was thinking holy matrimony
Holy moly was I incorrect, chain smokin' cigarettes
My tee is wrinkled but the irony is that I'm so depressed
Ain't no gettin' over this, I just lost my everything
Meanin' that even me breathing now is inhumane
She live through me until I die, this what love sound like
I'm her baby boy, she my rib I'm always by her side
God, lend my my angel for a day or so
I'd pack up all my sins and every L I blow and let 'em go

[Hook]

[Outro x3: Vic Mensa]
Make your bed, play for dead, kill your enemies
Smoke down, get drunk, have a party
Fall in love with you
Wonder if you still remember me
Or would you just fade away?


Every... where... you... go

Wake up wake up good morning
Go to sleep like Clay did Foreman
Ali Baba stole this Prada product
Private stock storing
Stupid booster used to
Loiter on stoops with Chuk and Chancellor
Make ya dance or chant my name
And if not just change the channel
Me and Yayo going ham in the whip nigga
Fuck that taking shots in the parking lot
Raps a tranny party room full of bitch niggas
No synagogue quite unorthdox
Top back like top that
Top gun like Tom Cruise
Tommy pickles, bitches jockin
In they panties Moulin Rouge
Red lipstick kiss slick as a slit wrist
Quick draw Vic
Put my dick on zip disk
Or send it to her in a TwitPic
Run up and die trying
But id rather just get rich
5-0 drive slow hot coal move ya feet
Pick and roll ooh ya sweet
Good to go o-o-oh

[Hook:]
Oh oh oh what a lovely day
It...is what a lovely day
[x4]

Sun is shinin'
Night is callin'
I think I'm fallin'
Fallin' for you
[x2]

Not too loud cause the baby sleepin'
And the next door neighbors they be tweakin'
And the rent been due since last week
But the last few nights been a crazy weekend
We can communicate without speakin'
She can feel what I been thinkin'
I been thinkin'
Maybe that maybe you had brought up and that baby
I'm goin' out of my head a bit
They told me come back down to earth
Swerve lanes in a minivan packed full of
Grade school kids and a pound of herb
Urban disturbin' turban totin' terrorist smokin' potent
Afghan my pack and I back hand ballot holders yea bitch I'm voting
INNANET el presidito my runnin' mate just me and Nico
He the genius I'm Don Carlito comeback season
Drake in a pea coat
Pullin' up in a stolen El Camino
Like where the Black Keys go
Lean in my uh Jarritos
(In Humboldt Park waving hi to the mamacitos)
To you truly from the, one who loves you most
Work your feet and then work your beck
Say I'm a loser that's where it's at
Too cool for school never had no fun
Let's get crazy let's get stupid
Stick a wet fork in a USB port
INNANET electrocution

[Hook]


[Intro:]
Abra kadabra
Yo, this one is just to let you know
Believe in magic
INNANET

[Verse 1:]
This year I had a lot of fun
Between duckin' and dodgin' hoes
Doin' shows and hittin' the road like I was on the run
I ran into some shit to be proud of, look mom I found out
What Malcolm and Martin missed it was miss and makin' an album
Alright alright alright, order in the courtroom
Yo of course I'm still gon' save it I used to take shit from Nordstrom
Strange twist, the speaker that never listened in class
Clap your hands and stomp your feet, told the teachers to kiss my ass
It's for the bad kids and the math kids and the shorties flippin' on a mattress
Growin' up not knowin' how to imagine
Never let anyone tell you anything you can't be
My biggest win always been when I knew they didn't believe
Where would I be if not standin' on the stage, spillin' my heart out on this page
Paper, viewing movies and rubber toilets to get paid
Do you believe in magic? I know I do
Only thing better than dreamin' is seein' it all come true

[Hook:]
I know that you know that I know what you like
You love the stars and the cars and the lights
But when it gets hard, do you ever doubt
Just wanted to let you know
Never let 'em tell you what you want or what you don't
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?
Do you believe in magic?

[Verse 2:]
Poppin' out of a cloud of billowing smoke I appear
Playin' a purple card at a moment of uncertainty
Terminally diagnosed, the power to write the cure
I been killin' myself slowly just like a bad heart surgery
Searchin' for somethin' different from them
Or what is it that defines us? And is it that it ultimately binds us?
The natural man won't lie, I need my woman
See my bitch, she hold me down even in times when gravity couldn't
My foot done slipped, I fell off of a bridge
But thanks to the grace of a greater power I didn't fall on my head
I could've landed on my neck and snapped it
Instead of snapped it, my last address
I sent it a mass-message and now we'll perform by accident
Archetypical sob story, big dreams disappointment
Talkin' to me to talk to my brother like a hip conjointment
You know Chance? Team light-skinned
Course I do, I look just like him
We was just on the bus fightin'
In the studios stayin' up writin'
Much like when flowers in the spring bloom
Started down from the bottom, but I'm about to have a big June
Jumpin' out the gym like Space Jam
I used to breakdance in Nico's basement
Now we both tourin' around the nation, it's crazy

[Hook]

[Outro:]
Believe in what you feel
Believe in what you know
I'll show you this is real
I know where we could go
Believe, believe
Believe
Believe, believe


[Intro]

[Hook: x3]
To get you what you need
Make you love it, make you want it
Cause baby you are so amazing

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pack the bong, pack the bong, pack the bong, pack it
I'm Pacquiao on the track, flow the tempo you should tap it
Tap out or black out, black is beautiful say yes indeed
Leave my demons in the dust, conducting electricity
I'm Silkk the Shocker with a fifth of vodka
Bag of drugs in my knickerbockers
Bach on the staff sheet, trying to pen an opera
Sounds so beautiful
Fogging my bifocals window shopping at the Gucci store
Know when you want it, but just can't have it
Especially as an artist, don't that shit make you mad
Just breathe, breathe, breathe, it's all in your head
Know these labels wanna sign me for an arm and a leg
Cut my publishing in half like I have to fold
For a dollar, what's a half of a half a whole
Quarter water or Courvoisier, complicate things
When money's what you conversate, but this is just so that you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Hold up, hold up, hold up, yo wait up
Wait up, I'm a let you finish
But finna be famous one day just really ain't where I fit in
Fell in love when I was fifteen
I guess you could call it tennis
My tendency for this music
Is so much deeper than business
I build a beat in the morning
Record it before the evening
Why is it what seems important
Seems always to be misleading
I wish I could see the future
Just wish I could see the future
Tell me everything be okay just like my momma used to
My youths unfolding before me
Be twenty before I know it
I'm trying to write my Illmatic
Get TVs that's panoramic
Was riding around in a rental
And I don't mean it was rented
Totalled my momma's Prius, I vaguely remember spinning
I fell asleep from the studio, must've been saved cause no one hit me
They made a list about Chicago rappers and they skipped me
Maybe because I'm so much more
Forget what you not, this is about what you are

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
I wanted to see where you would go
So I left a light, all alone in the dark
I could see your reflection
I could see your reflection and I'm coming to get you
I wanted to be all that you know
So you couldn't see with a [?]
I guess you are who you are
At least I always know you got that far
Where you gonna go? When they're coming to get you
Where did you run? Another malcontent
I can't last a lot, I lost out again
I gain nothing at all, but knowing how to contend
Saying nothing was wrong, they're saying down the gin
Dream everyone lives inside a perfect world except me
Tell me how could that be?
I'm a slave to the rhythm of the beat, put the barrel to my body and they tell me move your feet
And he said

[Hook - Thundercat:]
Run, run, run
Or face this gun, gun, gun
Run, run, run
Or face this gun, gun, gun

Nobody move
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
You want a war, you're bound to get murked

Dance

[Breakdown:]
And I will let you use me if you want it
You will have your movie, pick your star
I know you love it in the spotlight, don't you? Don't you?
I know you love it in the spotlight, don't you?

[Verse 2:]
I know you love when you wake up and go to work
And remember that you forgot my name was on your shirt
Then you remembered that you fucked last chance you ever had
Anyway, too bad, I know that shit gotta hurt
I'm an E! True Woodlawn story
Internet short, flash gordy, passport sporty boarder
Going in a pair of Jordys
That boy gone in the air, catch 'em
Them New York girls, they like my southside accent
Ask if I ain't been killing it a lot
Is the INNANET hot? Is the radio pop?
Or popped up out of nowhere pulled the plug on they plot
Plucking the feathers from the phoenix 'till it's stuck as a rock
Now I'm in between myself and a hard place
Heartbreak hotel, for me it never goes well
At the car chase when my car breaks and my carburetor explodes
And I flatline at the same time as my heart rate

[Hook]


[Intro:]
What do you do when your dreams really start to come true?

[Verse 1:]
Every day can be a different state when you getting paid nightly
Let 'em throw salt, that's just the fire to the flame, that shit ignite me
Oh, don't you want an autograph? Give your daughter some
I still keep my team on my back, cause that's where I started from
My niggas know I got 'em if I ever got an obligation
I read between the lies, see through the lies inside the conversation
I been patient, I wrote this shit down in my momma basement
She just wanna retire
I just wanna tell her she can
Look back at her baby boy like damn that's one hell of a man
Tell her friends at work, repeat it and tell 'em again
I'm yelling, "Yeah! Hell yeah! I got my foot on they neck"
They might as well compare me to myself, I'm as good as it gets
I think about my time with the band if I would've went back and did something different
Naw: I ain't trippin'
I'm full speed ahead, schurr, watch I switch when I'm whippin'
They used to call me Vic but now they just call me that nigga

[Hook 1:]
Used to call me a fucking failure
I bet I'm looking familiar like damn he really that nigga
I did it
I bet your girl would be with' it, she ain't used to know my name, now she just call me that nigga
Now they just call me that nigga

Matter fact, you could call me that nigga
Naw, put my name in your phone "That Nigga"
For real

[Verse 2:]
That nigga, been a nigga forever, don't you remember?
Toured with Disclosure in January, I'll be gone till November
I told my girl I'll move to Cali when I ain't had the rent up
I might put 50k into options to out do nigga's income
And y'all already know I wouldn't say it if I ain't really mean it
My dick tell 'em my name is big, bitch I'm Willie Beamin'
Beam me up, Scottie, I been thinking of heaven, I been dreamin'
With dreams may come true
Jermaine tests my line, I was drivin' down 69th
He said, "It's Cole, " I'm like, "What? Who?"
It's J.Cole, nigga, I'm on tour and I want you
So shouts to No I.D. fuck the bullshit
Between me and you, you know you my nigga
And ship know I'm that nigga
It's for everything, Tunchi, Millie Mil, and Hit-Boy, too
Trip, Dan, mom and dad, my fam
Natalie you my number uno, baby you know I'm your one too
So you ain't gotta trip when bitches ask for a picture
They be like, "Wait are you...

[Hook 2:]
That nigga? (Yes I am)
They told me that y'all be lonely, you know me I got homies
I guess that I'm just that nigga (Yes I am)
Like I ain't work my ass off, had that cast on stage fresh out the hospital, my nigga
Like anything is possible, my nigga
They just call me that nigga
You wanna know what, they just call me that nigga (Yes I am)

[Outro:]
Yo, shout out to everybody that believed up 'til this point. I feel like I'm on top of the fucking world right now. King Kong shit. I fell off a fucking bridge. I got electrocuted by like thirty thousand volts of electricity. I was in the hospital for three nights, then got on a flight to New York to go meet with Atlantic Records the day I got out. I came back, I was on stage the day I got back with a cast on my arm. That's me. Save Money still alive. You know it's like nine months ago I was in such a different place, I was in a fucking band and everything I had fell through the cracks right before my eyes. A lot of people probably didnÃ¢ÂÂt think IÃ¢ÂÂd still be on my feet after that, but the only thing you can count on in this life is change. This shit is dedicated to my pops for all those last minute flights. To Cody for putting up with my shit and doing everything you ain't wanna do to make this shit come to light. To Natalie for believeing in me when nobody else did. To Waxx and Ill America for helping me build the vision. To Kev and Peter Cottontale for making this shit a masterpiece. To Papi Beats for the late night sessions. What's left to say? Haven't I said it all? Did I sing enough songs for you? Thank you. Peace

[Internet Skit:]
Vic! What you doin'? Get off the internet!


[Intro: Vic Mensa]
Ay Trip, where that smoke at?
Let me hit that bitch one time
Bless me, yeah
Stanky man
Boi 1da, INNANET, INNANET-NET-NET-NET-Nuh

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I was losin' it, lost in the dark, but I found my lighthouse
I like when it rains in the spring
Light a J better seen with the lights, oh
(Dolo) Speakers in the Mac back like Rose like Mike, no
I know in the end niggas left, but I guess it's all alright, no
I mean, I know all them, their armors in that science ain't it
Prolly the reason my people's pupils so dilated
If you gon' die, might as well die young
Tryin' to be optimistic with the politicians
Cut schools, buy guns, but when the shots is lickin' at the ones that'll lose they son
Instead they send 'em to private schools and pull back on public funds
While functioning as if they could begin to fathom where the fuck we comin' from
Sometimes I hold my tongue, talkin' feels useless
I used to point in circles for wasted years lost in excuses
Time is money, every second I spent in high-school clockin'
Should've been on the road fuckin' with hoes, fallin' through holes in my pockets
But everything happens for a reason
If you choose to look at it that way
And put truth into the things you do
And really believe what you say
They say the darkest night comes before the brightest morning
I like to think I'd ask the right things if God was right before me
Like, why you let babies get shot while babies is killin'?
All because the system that raised me from grade school made me the villain
Barely out of my momma's crib
Can't even tie my own laces
Just moved into a brand new place
But somehow I still miss my basement
I guess the thing about lookin' back is you can't change leavin'
And I guess the thing about judgin' the past is that it just ain't even

[Hook: Vic Mensa & Beldina]
I know that money makes the world go 'round
Money makes the world go 'round
But don't forget it when you get it
My pops told me, told me, "Make money
But the money you make don't make you"
Make money, but the money you make don't make you
Make money, but the money you make don't make you
Make money, but the money you make don't make you

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Save money, hope the money you save could save you
Silk my sheets set in sace my sugar for my table
Too easy readin' people, tweetin', tweakin' like they hate you
But what's even easier is callin' your mom just to say thank you
Could've been the one that never dropped
Could've been the one that got shot
Could've never seen what it means to be mean
Be trapped in a box
Strapped in a box Chevy with lil' Eddie back home on the block
Blockin' the sunlight
It's like a solar eclipse in my city in the middle of a gunfight
Straight shots hit kids in the dark
That's the way it is like Walter Cronkite
Drunk off of the thrill, I feel like shootin' back in the distance
Prolly bounce off of a light pole and kill a fuckin' kid in the kitchen
Kissin' the past goodbye
Buyin' a stairway to heaven cause in time we all have to die
I just know when my time comes I'm a have made mine

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, Sir Rockie I'm smoked out, but I'm grindin'
I'm never weed windin', but reclinin' while remindin'
You I'm a keep my foot on these pun niggas neck
Stay on the road like some wheels and a board and a deck
Young nigga wildin', gotta give respect
Rollie on my arm, I'm the one they elect
I got that fire flow, I'm the one they detect
Gotta get the check, these niggas wanna say, "Turn up"
But then they turn up and then they earn what?
Nothin', they frontin'
Here we go, we're the topic of discussion
Fresh nigga, but the flow is disgustin'
And the money come fast cause I run with the nigga that made
Every day we hustlin'
It's like we came with the master plan
Not just talk, but the cash in hand
Make a animorph into no-mans-land
We could make 100 grand just like no man can
But every time I sit and watch the weekend news
See how many people in the weekend lose
It give the boy the blues, fuck all these clothes and shoes
Motivation what they could use and I got it

[Hook]


[Intro: Vic Mensa]
Yup
Savemoney fuck nigga fuck shawty
HP, INANNET

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
You could-you could hear my trunk bangin' hangin' out the windows
Swangin' down your block with the birdy in my lap
You can hear my smoke, burnin' loud I'm back to business
Early in the morn niggas-niggas still rollin'
And I think it's that weed got me, I'm tweakin'
Maybe that lean got me I'm tweakin'
Pullin' donuts in the beam, homie I'm tweakin'
Bitch nigga you don't know me, stop tweakin'

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Sound like Ray J and Chris Brown on Celebrity Deathmatch
Where the latter of the two get his neck slashed
Or slapping a paraplegic with a pair of crutches
Or wiping my ass with Rosie O'Donnell's mustache
I got Martha Stewart cooking yola
Molly in the cherry cola, rub it on your areolas
She let me cactus the cat backwards
And vacuumed the seeds from out of my black backwood
I'm an author without the aardvark
Pull tricks like Card Shark, thumbs up to the camera like Nardwuar
Warhol & a Narwhal in an ark
Park the yacht in the water hit your daughter in a smart car
Heart colder than body parts frozen in ice
Chopped the digits leave the five fingers for the mice
Might pull a suicide mission and dip with the doors up
African elephants in my tour bus

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Where do babies come from? Porkin' the stork
Poorly parked pullin' into your Porsche with a Ford
44 on the dash, put a dent in your door, close your mouth
The witnesses never make it to court
Borderline stir crazy, crepes and beignet that's tasty
Especially drippin' with liquid rabies
Rail a adderall pill and cook mushrooms in my gravy
Put a hit on every YouTube commenter who hates me
I don't want to fight
I just want a quiet life and a nice little suburban place to cry at night
And an eye dropper filled to the top with cyanide
So my psychiatrist dies soon as she tries the Sprite
Psyche! I love everyone
Goodnight, thanks for having me, hope your mom's not mad at me
At Penn State yellin', "Free Sandusky!"
Does he know what he's doin'? He's tweakin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
I think the Illuminati is real
And your body's the peel and your soul is the fruit
And they goal is to steal and control all the juice
I seen way too many pyramids, that's from from Kufu
Foofoo niggas out here snakin' on the reggo
You should ask a snake where it's legs go
But then again I'm smokin' on the medical
Got the white owl look like an egg roll
And that was Scooby snacks, Petco
I'm a lunatic belong inside a loony bin
I burned it down for you because I love you, now I'm movin' in
Ooh a condominimum, condom in ya enema
Bumpin' Kanye like it just came out
No songs with Kendrick, we just hang out
They say a smart man looks like a mad man to a dumb man
But one man... wait I'm tweakin'

[Hook]

[Outro x2: Vic Mensa]
Sawed-off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a 40, smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gat the Internet didn't jump
La la la la la


[Intro:]
Good morning Vietnam
I'd like to welcome everybody to the INNANET
Tune in, log on

[Verse:]
I think I fell off the bed as a kid and I hit my head
Maybe was 'bout 10 first time that I tied Makayla up and they walked in
Welcome to INNANET, where to begin?
Might as well start at the tip top, give me a moment I'm runnin' from time
Seems like I'm tied to the clock as it tick-tocks
Tippin' the metropolitan axis in which I exist it's a trip to imagine
Imagine that which I inflict when I flip on the beat
I'm an artist, no need for a canvas
Campin' the van at the local campus
What do you mean he not there yet?
Hair-brained adolescent ass on the airwaves
Pullin' to your city with my niggas in the caravan, ridin'
Like do or die, ain't this some shit
Volume on 10 turn my shit up, they fist go pump like pistol grip
That Vic he stay up in some shit
Sometimes it's hard to let go of it
I be so high I be in orbit
She already courted me kinda cordially cornered me
So I stick her on the bumper like "coexist"
That's another one, give the drummer some
In this case I guess that's me
Who made the track? You can just ask me
I be on some next shit
Wonder why niggas still don't really respect it
When I spit that unexpected
Thoughts from the mind of the greater collective
Subconsciously copy me, niggas just can't help it
So many good ideas, why be selfish?
It seems like you can sing the blues all you want
But they don't really love you 'til you Elvis
Til the labels shelfin' your album, Lord help 'em
The hellbent one way train to fame with fake friends depends on the outcome
Pick it up quick, my shit too hot
What gets you hype what turns you odd?
Obviously optimism isn't really my business, I'll beg your pardon
Me and my niggas in the party and we get it started
I'll start the engine and the pendulum swings
I'm in a race of time to try and find a peace of mind of mine
A walking stan to the departed
Or hardly go and they don't know I think I wanna stop
It's somebody make a nigga wanna keep goin'
I'm goin' out of my head, I think I wanna die
I don't love myself, I bet the feds love me more
Had 'em and the minutes keep comin' with the reward
Let 'em get a village of the crack sinners and the black families that they destroyed
Finna hit the backhand and tapped into the Internet intro
Can it be all so simple?
Seems my weed bag gettin' thin, my pocket hold no scratch
I ponder if apocalypse comin' to hold me back
But baby if you love me let me take you where it's ugly
To the place where no one comes, now we're standin' up and above me
My Lord, no no no no
I done seen demons

[Outro:]
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency
Tap into my frequency

Innanet, Innanet

[Hook:]
I don't need to worry 'bout nothing I'm good (How you doin')
I don't need to worry 'bout nothing I'm good (How you doin')
I don't need to worry 'bout nothing I'm good (How you doin')
I don't need to worry 'bout nothing I'm good (How you doin')

I got yap yap
Slam
I got yap yap
Slam
I got yap yap
Slam
I got yap yap
Slam

[Verse 1:]
How to make it in American
Where they die by the power of the gun and they live by the fair one
And the fair one is rarely an option, if you ain't got one I advise to carry one
Shots in reverse of the barrel of the pistol is kind of like shooting in the mirror
Niggas be killing themselves cause they feeling themselves
No Scared Straight, throw children in jail
General consensus is we off the hinges
Slam
Can't say a word to the judge, but he caught the sentence
No lacking homie, don't be caught defenseless

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
This that slam, hide it under the mattress
Ditch that van to the undisclosed address
Dish that gram to grammar school graduates
They gradually will develop those habits
Can't buy weed, you ain't got no dough
Can't ask me how you finna get paid
Ain't no thieves when the whole city broke
Breaking into cars in the middle of the day
Danger, danger, plus you got your banger
Police pull you over
Better hope that baby inside that manger make 'em miss they quota
Good Jesus
God almighty, why this shit so dope?
I got slam, put me on the track with one of these squares and they get smoked

[Hook]


[Intro - Vic Mensa:]
Yeah (yeah)
Yung Netscape
Save Mula baby!
Owwwwww!
Uh-huh

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook x8 - Vic Mensa:]
Yung Net Save Peso

[Bridge - Eliza Doolittle:]
So why do you wanna know?
I'm not that puppy dog jumping for bones
How high will you go?
The makers are making it, there'll be no faking it

[Verse 1 - Vic Mensa:]
Oooooh, lemme talk my shit
16 when they tried to give me 35 hundred
Now them labels back on my dick
Yap yap woop-woop
How's life these days?
Gotta say man shits legit
Generally a rowdy roller rolling ayatollah
Tell me that ain't blowing up quick
Shit for the birds, let 'em sleep with the fish
First off, tell 'em Vic back
To bury the bullshit niggas be signing
To be honest yo I told No I.D. that shit wack
Wasn't even trying to be arrogant
Bearing comparison to us
I mean it's kinda just fact
Who could make the globe shift with a flow switch when I wrote this
I was on a plane feelin' like David Blaine
I blow 'em out the water when they try to put me in a box
Box with God when I throw fists
High society Haile Selassi out with a full clip
Basquiat with a pen
Hand paint the benz in the bodyshop
Kamikaze top blown back you a throwback
God knows we the new shit
You know the name you know the gang
I know they saying we up next
But fuck that I'm right now
Yung Net!

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Ain't shit change but everythang
Wonder how I stay afloat
When the pressure on my name could probably make a levee sink
Sing another song
See beauty in the pain
Paint a picture, put ya picture in a magazine
Lost a few niggas, red tattoo for my blues
True back when I was 17 I couldn't wait to be king
Close my eyes in my sleep
Hear my dreams sound so loud
Every show sold out
So to happens it happened
Poof!
Magic, jumping like Mike I'm Johnson meets Jackson
Yap yap (woop woop)
Hitting 6 corners in a drop top, that's a hexagon
Someone told me I've been 'posed to blow
I'm cutting you from the rope, if I'm next in line
Be careful how you react (be cool)
They actually after you happily capture you cappin' your beef
Put a bullet in your back
Killers stay awake when the streets go to sleep
TV's in the seat couldn't show you where you at
Pitch black, nightmare
Kill 'em right there
Write like Richard Pryor to rap
Toussaint to slave was supplying the sack

[Hook]

[Outro:]
[Dan:] Yooo, Vic, whattup man? Yo, I'm just making sure, yo are you sleeping?
[Vic:] Huh, yeah... Shit, I dunno
[Dan:]
What? Vic, the flight leaves at 7: 30 man
Leavin' [?] at the LAX
[Vic:] 20 to the 0, shawty got that ass though. [coughs] What's up?
[Dan:] Dude, get up! You need to get to the airport now, man
[Vic:] Alright I'm up, I gotchu, I'm up. I'm up. I'm finna just, just like lay back down for a second and shit, but I'm up though
[Dan:] Go, cause you're late, don't be late man. I need you to get on that plane. 7: 30 leaving O'Hare going to LAX


Baby lion goes
Where the islands go

You say you never saw this comin', well you're not alone
Million dollar renovations to a happy home
My ex says she gave me the best years of her life
I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right
I wake up, assessin' the damages
Checkin' MediaTakeOut
Pictures of me drunk walkin' out with a bitch
But it's blurry enough to get the fake out
I wake up, all veggies no eggs
I hit the gym, all chest no legs
Yep, then I made myself a smoothie
Yeah, then me and wifey make a movie
Chicago - St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
Ãndale Ãndale E.I, E.I, uh, oh
You had me drivin' far enough to switch the time zone
You was the best of all time at the time though
Yeah, you wasn't mine though

But I still drove 30 hours
But still drove 30 hours to you

I remember rapping for Jay and Cam
Young producer just trying to get his flows off
I remember being nervous to do Victoria Secret
'Til I pictured everybody with they clothes off
Expedition was Eddie Bauer edition
I'm drivin' with no winter tires in December
Skrrt skrrt skrrt like a private school for women
Then I get there and all the Popeye's is finished, girl
You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need that happy beginnin', middle and endin'
Chicago, St. Louis, St. Louis to Chicago
It's gettin' hot in hurr, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, 3 stars for you
You call down for an omelet
Girl it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob
Cause you was in college complainin' about it's no jobs
But you were suckin' a nigga's dick the whole time
Well I guess a blowjob's better than no job

And I drove back 30 hours

Were remains that long to lose sad
Better unsaid
Always turn, oh

[with AndrÃ© 3000:]
3 stacks, can you help me out?

Yeah, this the type of shit you ride out to

Yo Gabe
I'm just doing a... just doing an adlib track right now
What's up?

Dirt and grime and filth inside
The story of my lifetime
Of cheating, stealing, never feeling
Pain of a brother, your dirty mother
Ha, ha, ha, look how far we are, are, are, are, are, are, are
(Perfect!)

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy just jumped over Jumpman
(Yo!)

Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished
I done talked a lot of shit but I just did the numbers
Herzog and Adidas, man you know they love it
If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man they wouldn't have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man they wouldn't have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, "Get your money"
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', all y'all get the message?
On the field I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (Yo!)
10 thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (Yo!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (Yo!)

Now we hottest in the streets, it ain't no discussion
James Harden, Swaggy P runnin' up the budget (Yoga flame!)
Keep the work at my baby mama's mama's house
I'm a jerk, you need to work, you need to call my spouse
Yeezy, Yeezy, take a picture with me on Rodeo
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I might do my own hotel
Couches, couches, couches, couches, which one should I pick?
I need extra deep, I like my bitches extra thick (sonic boom!)
Every time I see the news, man it bring me home
Call up DJ Mano, shout out Twilite Tone
We just blessed to be alive, yeah ain't that the truth?
So let's celebrate the life of Timbuck2
Timbuck2, Timbuck2

Sorry I ain't called you back
The same problem my father had
All his time, all he had, all he had
In what he dreamed
All his cash, market crashed
Hurt him bad, people get divorced for that
Drops some stacks pops is good
Mama pass in Hollywood
If you ask, lost my soul
Driving fast, lost control
Off the road, jaw was broke
'Member we all was broke
'Member I'm coming back
I'll be taking all the stacks

[Desiigner:]
I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Going out like Iâm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Selling bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga, pull up ya panty
Hope you killers understand me

[Kanye West:]
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
Taking all the stacks, oh

[Kanye West:]
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul, my soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul

[The Weeknd:]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Kanye West:]
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have the laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
And I...

[The Weeknd:]
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
They wish I would go ahead and fuck my life up
Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me

[Section 25 & Kanye West:]

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye


You want me to give you a testimony about my life, and how good he's been to me.
I don't know what to tell you about him,
I love him so much with all my heart and my soul with every bone in my body I love him so much because he's done so much for me. 

Every morning, every day of my life.
I won't always be crying tears in the middle of the night, and I won't always have to wake up by myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day.
I won't always have to think about what I'm gonna do and how I'm gonna, how I'm gonna make it, how I'm gonna get there, because he...
he's gonna be there for me. Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will.
I won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name.
Some day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.

No matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there,
with his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to.
I'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.


[Junie Morrison:]
La di da di da, da
I like this flavor
La di da di da, la
Let me tell you
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

[Kanye West:]
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)
Please (shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (shake that body, party that body)
Please (shake that body, party that body)

[Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West:]
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, one thing
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making them mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Ladies say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Kanye West:]
Scary
Scary
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA

Friday night tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat something pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury taste buds
And the Louis Vuitton store, got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only get hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir
Any rumor you heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use their kids as meal tickets
Not knowing the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em really
I remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content of slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades
I be paranoid every time
The pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'
The problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
I had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans
I'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it
It took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out
God damn, got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money, money, money, money
Big, big money, money, money, money
And as far as real friends, tell my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker

[Larry Graham:]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know who can take your place

[Kanye West:]
Please, no more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more parties in LA
Please, baby, no more parties in LA, uh
No more (Los Angeles)

[Junie Morrison:]
I'm out here from a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far
SWISH


[Kanye West:]
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up, I'm drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you're not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign:]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, to the real end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, oh you good?"
You say, "I'm good" then great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him


[Kanye West:]
Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time
Back in the lab and shit

[Kanye West:]
My wife said, I can't say no to nobody
And at this rate we gon' both die broke
Got friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter
My friends best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spending
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretending
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Grow conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most Blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa
The ultimate Gemini has survived
I wasn't supposed to make it past 25

[Sampha:]
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
The night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby

[Kanye West:]
I've been waking the spirits of millions more to come
A million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums
I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share they truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a cheque-book
But buy a new car, talking 'bout how my neck look?
Well it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buying our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people, real
I've awoken from an enlightened man's dream
Checking Instagram comments to crowd-source my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego and confidence was my last resort
I know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I turned on the news and they was burying me
One set of footsteps, you was carrying me
When I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'mma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern day MJ with an off-the-wall flow

[Sampha:]
Nightlife, walk all over me
Walk all over me
I'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring
Fly, fly, fly overseas
Fly overseas
Oh, anywhere, everything but in between

[Sampha:]
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Oh, you're looking in the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

[Sampha:]
Please face me when I speak
Please say to me something before you leave
You've been treating me like I'm invisible
Now I'm visible to you, oh, the invisible truths
Stay sober
I don't quite understand the games you play
Understand, understand
Understand I'm standing under oath
And I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore
While I'm crying at the bar
I'm wishing that you saw my scars, man
I'm wishing that you came down here
And stood by me
And look at me like you knew me
But I feel so alone
Like I don't know anyone except the night sky above

[Sampha:]
And you're looking at the church in the night sky
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife
Yeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky
Father, father, father
Wondering whether God's gonna say hi
Are we looking at the church in the night sky?
Father, father, father
And you wonder where is God in your nightlife

Deliver us serenity

I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith

[Kelly Price (Choir):]
So why send depression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? More
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong to save
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light, Lord
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
Cause I, I look to the light

[Chance The Rapper:]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know
Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'mma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil Chano from 79th

[Kanye West:]
We on an ultralight beam

But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war

[Kirk Franklin & Choir:]
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough.
This prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.
For everyone that feels they've said "I'm sorry" too many times.
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need...
Faith, more, safe, war


Turn it up!

[Kanye West:]
Step up in this bitch like (turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah I'm the one your bitch like
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight
And she grabbin' on my dick like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave

[Chris Brown:]
Waves don't die
Let me crash here for the moment
I don't need to own it
No lie
Waves don't die, baby
Let me crash here for a moment
Baby I don't, I don't need to own...

[Kanye West:]
Sun don't shine in the shade (turn it up!)
Bird can't fly in a cage (turn it up!)

The feelings don't really go away
That's just the wave (yeah)

[Chris Brown:]

[Kanye West:]
Lost and beat up
Dancin' down there
I found you somewhere out
Right 'round there, right right there
Lost and beat up
Down there, dancin'
I found you somewhere out
Right down there, right 'round there

Lost and, found out
Turned out, how you thought
Daddy, found out
How you turned out, how you turned out
If mama knew now
How you turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, I need you now

Got to love you
Found you, found you
Right now, right now
Right now, right now
If your mama knew how
You turned out, you too wild
You too wild, you too wild
You too wild, and I need you now
Lost and found now

[Vic Mensa:]
Cry, I'm not sorry
Cry, who needs sorry when there's Hennessey
Don't fool yourself
Your eyes don't lie, you're much too good to be true
Don't fire fight
Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
Don't fly too high
Your wings might melt, you're much too good to be true
I'm just bad for you
I'm just bad, bad, bad for you

[Sia:]
I was lost and beat up
Turned out, burned up
You found me through a heartache
Didn't know me, you were drawn in
I was lost and beat up
I was warm flesh, unseasoned
You found me in your gaze
Oh I found me, or Jesus

I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
I was too wild, I was too wild
And I need you now
Lost and found out

You gotta let me know if I could be your Joseph
Only tell you real shit, that's the tea, no sip
Don't trip, don't trip, that pussy slippery, no whip
We ain't trippin' on shit, we just sippin' on this
Just forget the whole shit, we could laugh about nothin'
I impregnate your mind, let's have a baby without fuckin', yo
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow
I know it's corny bitches you wish you could unfollow
I know it's corny niggas you wish you could unswallow

You tried to play nice, everybody just took advantage
You left your fridge open, somebody just took a sandwich
I said baby what if you was clubbin'
Thuggin', hustlin'
Before you met your husband?
Then I said, "What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph around hella thugs?
Cover Nori in lambs' wool
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves."
"What if Mary was in the club
'Fore she met Joseph with no love?
Cover Saint in lambs' wool
Yes she was
We surrounded by the fuckin' wolves."


[Chorus]
[Kanye (Female Voice)]

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, then I'm co coming over
Cuz its ne-never over

[Chorus]
[Kanye (Female Voice)]

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)

I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doge, henny and c-c-c-cola, and I keep co coming over
Cuz its ne-never over

[Chorus]
[Female Voice (Female Voice)]

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But... (You Make Me Smile)

(You make me smile with my heart)

[INSTRUMENTAL]

[Chorus]
[Kanye (Female Voice)]

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But... (You make me smile, With my heart)

I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um
Let how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends
Remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, Ok, Ok (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just
Uhh not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly
I mean let it be
Just let it be
I mean you, her and me (You make me smile with my heart)
I mean you, her and me
Maybe, Baby, Baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it

(You make me smile...)


[Chorus: Brandy]
I always knew that one day
They'd try to bring me down
Wow, one day, they tried to bring me down
Always knew that one day, they'd try to bring me down
Down, way down

[Kanye]
We're going to mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say, I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they're gonna have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'cause when I was barely living, that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some lee way on the he say she say
You girl don't like me, how long has she been gay
Spanish girls say "No hable inglÃ©s"
And everybody want to run to me for their single
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dog, If I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dog, If I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mill myself, and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, you all fronting
Everybody feel a way about K but at least you all feel something

[Brandy]
Why you come here, I bet it only it was forget to get you
What kind of dream we found, see I'm often at your cross way
forgetting it was that heaven let you. They tried to bring me down

[Chorus - 5X]


Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass 
After that I grab yo ass

Why you actin' all
Shy and all
Why is y'all
Lyin' for?
"I never did this before..."
Stop that
What, you want some petron?
I got that.
I mean I promise y'all
You fine and all
And your girlfriend, she kinda raw 
But she not like you
No, she not like you
Right now I need you to mute all the monologue
All that talkin is gon' give me a tylenol
You put a nigga to sleep, I'm tired of ya'll
Right now the Louis Vuitton don is signing off
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some Cris and some Mo
And we about to let it floooooow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it bloooooow

Yeah, you know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that, I grab yo ass

See you know my style
I'm very wild
And I vow that my child will be well endowed
Like his daddy
And tell him that your mama had a fattie
He looked up at me said, "daddy that's the reason why you had me?"
Yep, we was praticing 
Til one day your ass bust through the packaging
You know what though? You my favorite accident 
So go head pop some Cristal 
For my newborn child cuz now y'all

Know what this is
It's a celebration, bitches!
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab yo ass
But, I just thought you should know
We hit the liquor store
Got some cris and some mo
And we about to let it floooooow
Had some problems before but see we let em go
Got an ounce of that dro
And we about to let it bloooooow

Ho! Ho! (We lookin' for some) Ho! Ho!

[Kanye]
How we stop the black panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that?
What Jill Scott was hearin
When our heroes and heroines got hooked on heroin.
Crack raised the murder rate in DC and Maryland
We invested in that it's like we got Merril-Lynched
And we been hangin from the same tree ever since
Sometimes I feel the music is the only medicine
So we cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it,sell it
The fiends cop it
Nowadays they cant tell if that's that good shit
We ain't sure man
Put the CD on your toungue yeah, thats pure man.

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the place where the fathers gone,
The mothers is hardly home
And the...
Gonna lock us up in "Audy Home"
How the Mexicans say we just tryin to party homes
They wanna pack us all in a box like styrofoam
Who gave Saddam anthrax?
George Bush got the answers
Back in the hood it's a different type of chemical,
Am and Hammer baking soda
Raised they own quota
Writin when our soldiers ran for the stove cuz--
Cuz dreams of being 'Hova went from bein a brokeman ta bein a dopeman
Ta bein a president look theres hope man
This that inspiration for tha mos and tha folks man,
Shorty come and see if mama straight overdosin.
And this is the soundtrack,
This tha type of music you make when you round that--
Crack music nigga,
That real black music nigga.

[Malik Yusef]
Our father, give us this day our daily bread ...give us these days and take our daily bread,
See I done did all this ole bullshit
And to attone I throw a little somethin, somethin on the pulpit.
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit
And what we gave back was crack music
And now we ooze it through they nooks and crannies
So our mammas aint got to be they cooks and nannies
And we gonna repo everything they ever took from granny
Now the former slaves trade hooks for Grammys
This dark diction has become America's addiction those who ain't even black use it.


[Intro]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like "pssh we messed up"
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog "Yo, where Dame at?"
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?"
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)


[Intro:]
Diamonds are forever
They're all I need to please me
They can't stimulate or tease me
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook:]
"Diamonds are forever forever forever"
Throw ya diamonds in the sky
If you feel the vibe
"Diamonds are forever forever forever"
The ROC is still alive
Everytime I rhyme
"Forever and ever! "
For ever ever? for ever ever? ever ever?
Ever ever? ever ever? ever ever? ever ever?

[Verse 1:]
Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of Diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glowin
I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain
These ain't conflict diamonds, is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
How? when I know of the blood diamonds
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
Spend ya whole life tryna get that ice
On a polo rugby it look so nice
How could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
[Kanye From Original Song:]
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (uh)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (uh)
You know the next question dog 'yo, where Dame at? ' (uh)
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!)
'Wassup with you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man? '
[Jay-Z:]
Yep!
I got it from here 'ye damn!
The chain remains, the game is in tact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs]
Pardon me I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar
I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep,
I sold Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my buisness, damn!
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy
YG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly
What I was sayin practically me whole career
The diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose from the ashes like a phoenix
If you waitin' for the end of the dynasty sign
It'll seem like forever is a mighty long time
I'm young bitches [laughs]
Goodnight!


[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

[Kanye:]
My homey Mali used to stay one 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street form Calumet a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
Walk around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Dayton's in his hand
Keys in his hand reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alesis he had dreams of Caprice's
Drove by the teachers even more by police's
How he get that cash today his father passed away
Left him with a little something 16 he was stunting
Al B Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit lakeshore girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You were the Chi town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had the Lincoln's and Aurora's we were hurting them all
With the girls a lot of flirting involved
But dawg fuck all that flirting I'm trying to get in some draws
So put me on with these hoes homey's
He told me don't rush to get grown drive slow homey
Drive slow homie
Drive slow...
Ya never know homey about these hoes homey
Ya need to pump your breaks and drive slow homey

[Paul Wall:]
What It do
I'm posted up in the parking lot my trunk wavin'
The candy gloss is immaculate and is simply amazing
Them elbows poking wide on that Candy-lac
Trunk open, screen's on, neon's lit with fifth relax
I'm on a mission for dime piece's and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawling, you see them screens falling
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm balling
I'm leaning on a switch sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boopas if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard hitter all about the scrilla
Riding some candy coated crawling like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on those 4's I'm jamming off this screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby what it do?

[Chorus:]
Drive slow homey
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes
Drive slow homey
If you riding around the city with nowhere to go
Drive slow homey
Live today cause tomorrow man you never know
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey

[Kanye:]
My cars like the movies my cars like the crib
I got more TV's in here then where I live

[GLC:]
And it don't make no sense but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip you know is something serious
I got the custom grill I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics baby that's evident
You see a player flicking and you ain't convinced
That you should go and kiss it just a little bit
I wear my custom kicks I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleaming though my angle wings
They see me hoes acting like they seen a king
With that mean lean smoking on the finest Cali green
My wood grain oak I'm riding on vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes little homey drive slow

Chopped and Screwed
Yeah..
Drive slow homey
Drive slow homey
Ya never know homey might meet some hoes homey
Ya need to pump your brakes and drive slow homey
Drive slow homey


[Jamie Foxx]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah she's a trifling friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me

[Chorus:]
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger (when I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She gives me money)
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger (when I'm in need)
But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)
Get down girl gone head

[Verse 1:]
Cutie the bomb
Met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton
Under her underarm
She said I can tell you rock
I can tell by your charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm
But I'm looking for the one
Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have an ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz
OK get your kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid
You know why?
It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend says she use to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say I still love her

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
18 years, 18 years
She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids
His baby mamma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lipo with your money
She walking around looking like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured got GEICO for your money, money, money
If you ain't no punk holla we want prenup
WE WANT PRENUP! Yeah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo ass she gon' leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now I ain't saying you're a gold digger you got needs
You don't want your dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why y'all washing watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he mopping floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know this dude's balling but yeah that's nice
And they gone keep calling and trying
But you stay right girl
And when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl

Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head get down
Get down girl go head
(lemme hear that back)


Wished I had told
Ooh was (the) only one
But it's too late, it's too late
He's gone

[Kanye West]
You sweat her, and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a big L, and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
BROTHER NUMPSAY!  Groupies sound too choosy
Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

[Chorus]
Too late, we, gone - we strivin home
Gone - we ride on chrome
It's too late

[Kanye West]
Y'all don't want no prob from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to "Let it Burn"
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, "Bitch - it's yo' turn!"
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long
Cause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Chorus]
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] I ride on chrome...
We strivin home, gone
[Cam] Killa, I ride on chrome

[Cam'Ron]
Knock knock, who's there?  Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal ma we goin to the dealer booth
No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

[Chorus]
We strivin home, I ride on chrome
Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
Cause

[Consequence]
Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented "Gone With the Wind," cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[long instrumental pause]

[Kanye West imitating "The Show" at first]
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime-
-light, like, when I was on the grind
In the "One, Nine, Nine, Nine"
Before, model chicks was bendin over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!


Wake up Mr. West [echoes]

[Kanye West]

Uh, Yeah, Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

[Piano drops]

And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

[Kanye]
They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

[Beat Changes]


[Chorus]
(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cuz I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of "You, Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)

[Chorus (with variations)]


[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'll be late for that, baby I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin in when I feel like
To turn this muh'fucker up only if it feels right

[Kanye West]
Stop all your blood claat cryin, I was flyin
Made it to school with barely 'nuff time to sign in
Yeah I hear the alarm, yeah I hear you mom
Yeah yeah I don't wan' be broke when I'm 31
They said the best classes go to the fastest
Sorry Mr. West there's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives?  Not even prerequits?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin
With all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin
Man, this is a insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?
Like old folks pissin, I guess it all (Depends), oh, oh
... Stop you're cryin baby

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
You know when you be late you miss all the lights
That's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)
And when you get back she gon' start up a fight
That night (that night) that night
Baby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
Like them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian like
Hmmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later
I'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah

"I'll be late for that" - [repeat 4X]


Yeah

I'm on my way home

They say home is where the hate is
My dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to god that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubberband together in cashless bundles
We wear struggling chains
Divided only hustle remains
Making sense of it we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game
It's another name
For life fighting
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fighting for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he only get as high as he fell
Show money becomes bail
Relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale
Behold the pale
Horse got me trapped like r. kel', I bail and it-

Might not be such a bad idea if I never, never went home again
I'm on my way home
I left three days ago
But no one seems to know I'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain and it
Might not be such a bad idea if I never
Never went home again.


[Verse 1]

[Kanye West]
I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers
The doctor dont wanna take procedures
He claim my heart can't take the anastesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,
Hey chick, im at a lost for words
What do you say at this time?
Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gone be fine?
But i'd be lying, the family crying
They want her to live, and she trying
I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,
If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.S.
And all the broke muthafuckers past away
You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.
Right now she'd be ok?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church
For thirty five years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he's strong,
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse "did you do the research?"
She ask me, "can you sign some t-shirts?"
Bitch is you smokin reefer?
You dont see that we hurt
But still...

[Chorus]

...I smile
When roses come to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day
(Im seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

[Verse 2]

[Kanye West]
They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heart beat, beat, beat
If she gone pull through
We gone find out soon
But right now she sleep, sleep, sleep
My mama say, they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
Let me see the X-rays
I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off for work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Claire and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties, we could have an Auntie team
Feel like Amerie "Its this one thing"
When they said that she made it
You see the eyes gleam
I think we at an all time high
To get there we run, we fly, we drive
Coz with my family we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers
We the roses...

[Chorus]

I smile
When roses come to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day
(Im seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

Who brings the sunshine?

Ohhhhh I smile
When roses come to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day
(Im seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to breaK


I brought you brothers here to start our own fraternity
Broke Phi Broke, we ain't got it.
Broke Phi Broke (we ain't got it)
No, we have no money 
We are sharin' jeans.
If I go outside, I got the only clothing on.
How many cars do we own? (None!)
How many cars do we own? (None, sir!)
Should we let our woman go and be with the cat in the car?
Yes, we will.
Why? Because we can't afford gas. Say it with me!
(We can't afford no gas!)
Say it!
(We can't afford no gas!)
So we ain't drivin'!


We broke, broke broke phi broke
(We ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
(We ain't got it)
Don't spend no money
Ain't got no clothes
Ain't got no cars
Ain't got no hos
We broke, broke, broke phi broke
(We ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke
(We ain't got it)
Got no money (got no money)
We got no clothes (got no clothes)
Ain't got no cars (got no cars)
Can't get no hos
We broke, broke, broke, broke, broke
Buncha niggas
Broke, broke, broke, broke, broke!


This was founded years ago
By broke slaves, years ago
Who did not have, years ago
By broke brothas in the 20s, years ago
Who did not have when we could not eat 
Hmm, remember that?
Eating all of our cereal with forks because we wanted to save the milk, do you remember that? Hmm?
Do you remember all those Christmases when your Mama walked in the room and pretended she was the tree, huh?
Remember that?


[Quietly]
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
[Louder]
Broke, broke broke phi broke (we ain't got it)
Broke, broke, broke phi- 

[Leader:] I've called this private meeting today because there is an imposter among us.
There is an imposter among us.
This brother right here has been out making beats on the side, yes he has.
Pretending he's broke walking amongst us.
This brother has been eating every day, can you believe that? Eating every day.
Pretending he's with us, he's not one of us.
I did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.
I found new shoes!
Kanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!

[Kanye: (stammering)] I was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-

[Leader:] No, you speak up, brother!

[Kanye:] I was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-

[Leader:] What?

[Kanye:] I wanna stick to my roots, and-

[Leader:] What?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.
Don't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like
That, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.

What's next?


I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink Polos'd hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the Lox (locks)
Now let's go

Take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apartment

Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about a hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob a hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine

Jay favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am."
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in a accident 'cause this must be heaven

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day I die
I'mma touch the sky

Now let's take 'em high la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)
(Top of the world, baby. Top of the world)

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say "I get it"
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket

Before anybody wanted K-West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like "Man, these niggas that much better than me?"

Baby, I'm going on an airplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different

Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryna right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

Now I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl!
Testify
Come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third
Hear like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm tryna stop Lion like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, touchÃ© Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl
Testify
Come up in the spot looking extra fly
'Fore the day you die
You gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby
Sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high
Sky, sky-high
I'm, I'm sky-high

Keep it rolling
Feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!


[Bernie Mac]
[laughs]
I knew I was gonna see ya, I knew I was gonna see you again!
I was gonna see you again
Where your god damn book bag at?
Always carryin' that lil book bag
Nobody wanna see that
God damn fourth grader
Sit yo' ass down
?? wanna play it again like he got somethin else to do
You ain't got nothin' else to do
You ain't doin nothin wit yo life
[piano starts]
Nothing with your life
What do you think this is?
You betta look at me when i'm talkin' to you!
You think this is easy don't you?
You think this is promised
Oh ain't nothin promised with you
Look at my face, do I got a promise face?
Does it look like promise you anything?
Kanye!
Ni**a! Is you snorin' in my class?
Wake up Mr. West! Mr. West 
[echoes into next song]


[Chorus]
You motherfuckers better do your job and roll up and watch how we roll up and
I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I wanna fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hpnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothin to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Cool off thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

We major (come on, homie, we major) [repeat]

Feeling better than some head on a sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
Ask the reverand was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want like wino's want they good whisky
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me

[chorus]

[Nas:]
I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio consol asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

[chorus]


[Chorus - 4x]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

[Verse - Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus - to fade (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]


[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Golly, more of that bullshit ice rap
I got to 'pologize to Mos and Kweli (probably)
But is it cool to rap about gold
If I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? (Mali!)
First nigga with a Benz and a backpack
Ice chain, Cardi lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped I'd say somethin' significant
But now I'm rappin' 'bout money, hoes, and rims again
And it's still about the Benjamins
Big faced hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named Cinnamon
More chips than Pentium
What'cha gon' buy next? Whatever new trend it is
I'm tryin' to spend my stacks
And I'm so broke I look back like "Damn, was I on crack?"
I mean twelve platinum chains, was I on that?
What the hell was wrong with me dog?
Sing along with my y'all

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull the piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a Ph.D.: a Pretty Huge Dick
Ladies tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like this
And givin' head is like a whale, using the toothpick'
Well, I'm in the club for a limited time
Act now and get some action for $free.99
Later on I might charge for mÃ©nage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because she my caddy
Cuz she grabbed my golf balls in the club
And I'm still actin' calm than a mug
She asked "Can you drive me and the hunnies to where my Altima was?"
While we drive she tellin' me 'bout problems with her man
Baby I fully understand
Let me help you with a plan
While he trickin' off, don't get no rich nigga
Give ME some head, that'll really piss hI'm off
[inhales]

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I blow past low class niggas with no cash
In the fo' dash six, bitch you can go ask
So when I go fast popo just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second I'll be there with my weapon
Pullin' up in the Lexuses/'lexeses, one on both hand
So I guess them GSes was ambidextrous
Coulda sworn her breasteses was sendin' me messages
"K I need a free hand mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam"
So say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman
But if you don't need a fix, girl you gotta leave
You can't take that all at one time ya gotta breathe

[Hook: Ludacris]
Yeah, breathe in, breathe out
If ya iced up, pull ya sleeves out
Push a big truck, pull ya keys out
Girls go wild and pull ya deez out
Breathe in, breathe out
Let them hoes fight, pull her weave out
If a nigga act up, pull a Desert E's out
When I pull a piece out niggas like "Peace out!"

["Can you say Chi city?" scratched repeatedly]


[Intro: Kanye West]
How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all the glitter is not gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)
(real is what you live to be)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business

[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold
Now all I know I know all these things

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like "See, that's my cousin on TV"
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed

[Interlude: Choir]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business

[Interlude: Choir]
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing

[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold
Now all I know I know all these things

[Females:] (oooh) All these things (these things)
[Males:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[F:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[M:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[F:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[M:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[F:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[M:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)


[Kanye West]
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat
I'm trying to catch the beat, uh uh, uh
I'm trying to catch the beat

[Chorus (Kanye West):]
Now, throw your motherfucking hands
GET 'EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to your motherfucking man
GET 'EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down your hands
KEEP 'EM HIGH
And if your losing your high then* smoke again
KEEP 'EM HIGH

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now, my flow
Is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics
My freshman year I was going through hella problems
'til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta college
My teacher said I'm a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow my heart,
And if you follow the charts, or the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back,
You see I'm so Chi that you thought it was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Troy
And I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you asking for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We're assholes!
That's why we hear your music in fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more

[Chorus (Kanye West)]

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now who the hell is this?
E-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly
At NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus
Sent me a picture with her feeling on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli
(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib)
I mean
(That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib)
I mean
(You don't really know him, why is you lying)
You Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line
She's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high

[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes
But never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out
And my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out
Well OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo
Ain't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?
She's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior
Always got something to say like an OK player hater
Anyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet
Or chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it

[Verse 4: Common]
Get 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
You all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
The real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote control,
Rap is not a used to but still got love,
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you
You's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her
Album, how come, you the hot garbage of
The year, It's clear your image is snooped up
Label got you souped up, telling you you're sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba
Boulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper
You dancing for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring
Got your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then

[Chorus (Kanye West)]


What in the fuck was that Kanye
I told you to do some shit for the kids
You can give me your muthafucking graduation ticket right now
You will not walk across that stage, you wonât slide across that stage
A muthafucka canât pull you across that stage Kanye
Who told you see, I told you to do something up lifting
Iâm trynna get you out here with these white people and this how you gone do me
You know what us a nigga
And I donât mean that in no nice way
Had little kids sing about the shit, the jokes on you
You throw your mutha hands in the air, and wave good-bye to everybody
Cause you getting the fuck out of this campus
Mutha what you gone do now

I'm no longer confused but don't tell anybody.
I'm about to break the rules but don't tell anybody.
I got something better than school but don't tell anybody.
My momma would kill me but don't anybody.
she wants me to get a good ass job just like everybody. 
She ain'twalked in my shoes i'm just not everybody.


Some glad morning when this life is over,
I'll fly away.
To a home on God's celestial shore,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O Glory,
I'll fly away.
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,
I'll fly away.

When the shadows of this life have flown,
I'll fly away.
Like a bird thrown, driven by the storm,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O Glory,
I'll fly away.
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,
I'll fly away.

Just a few more weary days and then,
I'll fly away.
To a land where joy shall never end,
I'll fly away.

I'll fly away, O Glory,
I'll fly away.
When I die, Hallelujah, bye and bye,
I'll fly away.


Kanye, can I talk to you for a minute?
Me and the other faculty members was wonderin could you do a lil som...
Somethin beautiful
Somethin that the kids is gon love when they hear it
Thas gon make them start jumpin up and down and sharin candy an' stuff
Think you could probably do somethin for the kids for graduation to sing?


Yo, we at war
We at war with terrorism, racism, and most of all we at war with ourselves
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me) with me, with me, with me [fades]

You know what the Midwest is?
Young & Restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying, "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast."
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My mamma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mamma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November I got packs to move I Hope

[Hook 2x]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

(Jesus walks)
God show me the way because the devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks)
The only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walks)
And I don't thing there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walks with me... fades)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long


[Intro: Jay-Z (Kanye)]
[laughing]
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking..

(I'd like to propose a toast)
(I said toast motherfucker)

[Chorus: Kanye]
And I am (here's to the roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them (here's to Rocafella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky (here's to the roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the... (here's to Rocafella)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1]
The all around the world Digital Underground, Pac
The Rudloph the red nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my 15 seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Rocafella's only niggaz that help
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bourgie, he big-headed
Won't you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me 10 seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
Better take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-lI or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with Jay-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody loves Kanye
I'm almost Raymond'
Some say he arrogant. Can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggaz wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
'Oh my god, is that a Black Card?'
I turned around and replied, why yes but I prefer the term
African American Express
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Chorus]
"... last call for alcohol, for my niggaz"

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Rocafella, named Hiphop
picked the Truth beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him
I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do
I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?"
I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone
going back and forth, just askin me to send him beats
And I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers
cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with
And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID
And No ID told him, "look man, you wanna mess with Kanye
you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"
[No ID:] "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"
I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not
but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
[Hiphop:] "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper",
I'm like oh shit
I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also
People were like this, started talking about the Ghost production
But that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here
So you know. After they picked that Truth beat
I was figuring I was gonna do some more work
But shit just went poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago
I had my own apartment. I be doin' like, just beats for local acts
just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy
get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something
or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Hal Melville sample
I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like "oh, yo that shit is crazy
Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty."
And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me
so I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time
and really I just, like picked the drums off Xxplosive and put it like
with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style
when it started, when he rapped on 'This Can't be Life.'
And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on the Dynasty album
I could say that was the, the resurgence of this whole sound
You know, I got to come in and track the beat, and at the time
I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with
Hiphop. 'Cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm
sayin, 'cause I been there for a while, I appreciated what they did
for me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he
gotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. And that day I
came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "oh
you a real soulful dude" [Jay-Z: "you a real soulful dude"]. And he
uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got
to the studio, you know how he do it, one take. And he said
[Jay-Z:] "check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"
"tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking
like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z, I ain't
want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my
personal opinion. So he asked me, "what you think of it?"
[Jay-Z:] "so what you thinkin?"
And I was like, "man that shit tite,"
you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train
man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just
in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got
acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like
poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homeys that was one
of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through
my production company, but he ended up going straight with the
company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad
news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at
the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took
that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about
ten days before I had to actually get out. So I ain't have to deal
with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to
[Mother:] "Come on, let's just go"
Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment.
I remember I pulled up
[Mother:] "Kanye, baby, we're here",
I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a
bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and
the first beat I made was, uh, 'Heart of the City.'
And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up
there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I
played like seven beats. And, you know I could see he's in the zone
he already had the beats that he wanted, I did nothing like already at
that time. But then Jay walked in. I remember he had a GuccI bucket
hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said
"yo play that one beat for him." And I played 'Heart of the City.' And
really I made 'Heart of the City,' I really wanted to give that beat to DMX.
[Hiphop:] "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here".
And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that
GuccI bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of
them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen
Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like "yo what's up I'm Kanye."
[Dame:] "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"
"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay?
Yo, this nigga got classics"
[Dame:] "Jay got classics, G."
You know I ain't talkin shit.
I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm
still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggaz on the show
The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my
eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all
these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one
thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be
Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton
sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hiphop was there, I think Tata, John
Minnelli, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the
time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I
spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical
shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his
eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the West, the rap
was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.
He said "man that was tite."
[Jay-Z:] "That, that was cool. That was hot."
That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe.
Okay, fast forward.
So, Blueprint, H to the Izzo, my first hit single. And I just
took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship
with KwelI I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my
career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me
to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at
this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had
relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so
they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound
like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them
these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll
be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy
'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever
Everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they
didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked
with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the
company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave LottI fucked with me, my
nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man
[Jessica:] "Man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."
I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
"Y'all niggaz is stupid". Let's just say I didn't get my deal.
The nigga that was behind me, I mean,
he wasn't even a nigga, you know?
The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol
Records. He wanted to sign me really bad.
[Joe:] "We gonna change the game, buddy."
Dame was like, "yo you got a deal with Capitol,
okay man, just make sure it's not wack."
[Dame:] "you gotta make sure it's not wack."
Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to
play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and
Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll
never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'
"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got eleven plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."
Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So
I play that song for him, and he's like "oh shit"
[Dame:] "Oh shit it's not even wack."
"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."
[Dame:] "it's actually kinda hot."
Like they still weren't looking at me
like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole
album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and
save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's
like "yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick"
[Dame:] "you don't wanna catch a brick"
You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.
I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with
that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was
already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you
know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I
was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm
not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer
rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right--
the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do
man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio
sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes
man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said
"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"
[Mel:] "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."
And, you know I told them that Rocafella was interested
and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying
to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I
called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Rocafella?"


[Man]
Hey Jimmy where you going?

[Jimmy]
I dont know where I'm goin.
My Dad died, and he left me his degrees.
My mom would always say "Dad, why dont you work?", 
But he just kept learning.
All the other kids parents were working and saving up money for school, 
And I was actaully in school all when my dad was in school.
He was so gready with degrees, he took my degree.
And now I'm just glad he left me these.
Because all the regular homeless people have newspaper, and look what I have. 
These are documented.
My father left them for me.
And Im going to leave them to my kids.
I'm going to learn too.
I'm going to get super smart, so I to can die without money.
But I'll be the smartest dead guy.
Who has that.


Yeah Grandmama
Told you I won't let you down
Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[Jay-Z:]
Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First I had their ear now I have their heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been here from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watched them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mine's is sizzling
It's plain to see
Niggas can't fuck with me
'cause I'mma be that nigga for life
This is not an image
This is God-given
This is hard living
Mixed with Cristal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visiting
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[Kanye West:]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D. to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Nothing sadder than that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for they way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you see that car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my Left Eye
'cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[J.Ivy:]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryna give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called "Love"
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'cause whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out

When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found,one thing I found
Oh no you'll never let me down,
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)
Get up I get (down)

[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedaled rock before I met you,
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of them,
More of them on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay will get you maced,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.

She said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right
(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)

[Kanye West]

Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

My dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
I'm a play this Vandross
You're gonna take your pants off
I'm gonna play this Gladys Knight
Me and you're gonna get right

[Chorus X2]

[Twista]
Got you looking at the gliss at my hands and wrists

Trying to smoke a B
Looking properly
Feeling on a G?
And always (well well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping little spinners
While I'm smoking on a B
Dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B
And I got to leave
something to the 23's?
And I do it (well well well well well)
With my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumping Teddy Pendergrass
I'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'm gonna finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me

[Chorus X2]

[Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you ain't got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man
You got to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimping like an old man
You got to roll with the plan
Cause after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin'
Trying to make you moan
And I do it (well well well well well)


[Hook: Kanye West]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Mall'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like Kree Summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Maybach
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

[Hook: Kanye West]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 2: GLC]
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule said nine
Puttin' them pants on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Where I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

[Hook: Kanye West]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Verse 3: Consequence]
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

[Hook: Kanye West]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

[Outro: GLC]
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride


[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get right for the summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!

[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..

[Chorus:]
It's been a week without me
And she feels weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin to talk about less
She talks about freakin out so
Maybe we can work it out
Work it out [4x]
Maybe we could work it out

[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet
Ooh, girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still killa a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz
4 door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Ladies speaking w/ Kanye in the background]
[Jill] Hi, may name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to
Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player
And like now I shop every day on Rodeo drive
I just want to say, thank you Kanye! woooo! woooo! woooo!

[Lasandra] My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say
that ever since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape
I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's

And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck Ray Ray's
broke ass no mo'

(Work it mo' juge it mo' pump it mo, Chi-town mo' let's go mo')

[Alamae] My name is Alamae from Mobille, Alabama
and I just want to say since listenin' to Kanye's workout tape
I been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide
And I rode the plane, rode the plane, rode the plane

[Girl] Thanks to Kanye's workout plan
I'm the envy of all my friends
See I pulled me a baller man (yeah)
And I don't gotta work at the mall again

[Beat changes]

(I appreciate your time)
I want to see you work out for me
Woah, yeah


Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they, huh?

[Chorus:]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all away
Right down through the wire, even through the fire

I spit it through the wire man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll gladly risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the...
Chi-Town what's going on

[Verse 1:]
I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry Mr. H 2 the Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support?
Telling her your son's on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs
No use me tryin' to be lyin'
I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man

[Chorus]

I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru...
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was in the back of my mouth man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for you all right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah

[Verse 2:]
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mace felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two wanna sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe; safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look like Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Chorus]

Know what I'm saying
When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was going to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

[Chorus repeats till fade]


[Kanye West]
We in the streets playa, getcha mail
It's only two places you'll end up - either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go
Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas, boostas, hoes
Everybody, fuck that
Still nowhere to go...sill nowhere to go..

[Mos Def]
Two words, United States, no love, no brakes
Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals, everybody MOVE
Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game ball, lock shit, dump off, cock shit
We won't stop shit, everybody MOVE
Two words, BK , NY, bedstuy
Two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Every traffic, one lane, everybody MOVE
Two words, Mos Def, black check, hot shit
Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
Game point lock, long pump cocked
We won't stop, everybody MOVE

[Chorus: Kanye West (Harlem Boys Choir)]

[1] - Now throw ya hands up bustless, bustas (Throw your hands up high)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)

[2] - and keep ya hands up bustless, bustas (Till they reach the sky)
Boostas, hoes, everybody, fuck that (ohhhhhh)
Still nowhere to go...still nowhere to go... (ohhhhhh)

[Kanye West (Harlem Boys Choir)]
Aiyyo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide
Cuz I, rep that, till I, fuckin die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics
Go getters rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, playa hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, "Fuck you, pay me"
Screamin, Jesus save me
You know how the game be
I can't let em change me
Cuz on Judgment Day, you gon blame me
Look God, it's the same me
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (ohhhhhh)
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (ohhhhhh)
From the bottom to the top
The only place to go down

[Chorus 2nd verse]

[Freeway]
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap niggaz into two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
My God, two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free...young bars, fresh men of the Roc
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
and broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
Have you screamin out four words "Send for the Lord"
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad..

[Harlem Boys Choir (Mos Def)]

Oh, yeah. I got the perfect song for the kids to sing

[Kanye West:]
And all my people that's drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

If this is your first time hearing this 
You are about to experience something so cold man
We never had nothing handed
Took nothing for granted
Took nothing from no man, man I'm my own man

But as a shorty I looked up to the dopeman
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke man
Flicking Starter coats man, man you don't know man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, "Next summer I'm finna."
Sitting in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Trey's scholarship

'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sitting your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do something man your ass is grown

[Kanye West:]
Drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing

[Kanye and kids:]
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
Joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

The second verse is for my dogs working 9-to-5
That still hustle 'cause a nigga can't shine off $6.55
And everybody selling make-up, Jacob's
And bootleg tapes just to get they cake up
We put shit on layaway then come back
We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money cop work then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say

Mamma say she wanna move South 
Scratching lottery tickets eyes on a new house
Around the same time Doe ran up in dude's house 
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work he figured he'd take work

The drug game bulimic it's hard to get weight
So nigga's money is homo it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep baking 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say 

[Kanye West and kids:]
My niggas drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
The joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say "We don't care what people say"

You know the kids gon' act a fool
When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS some of them dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song's 12 Questions

We scream, rock, blows, weed park 
See now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up hold fast we make more cash
Now tell my mamma I belong in that slow class 

Sad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheel chair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromy wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here

Look at what's handed us our father's abandoned us
When we get them hammers go and call the ambulance
Sometimes I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say

[Kanye West and kids:]
My niggas drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing
We wasn't supposed to make it past 25
The joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky
And say we don't care what people say

[Kanye West:]

And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that taking Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle, almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable and I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic, that's just some Ye shit

I can focus on two things at once

[Shirley Ann Lee:]
Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I will wear a starry crown
[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on some days
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, some day

[Kid Cudi:]
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me

[Kanye West:]
Some day we gon' set it off, some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all, on a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone, and they'll pray, no, oh, no
Sometimes I take all the shine, talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind, I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds, caught between space and time
This now, with the world in mind, but maybe some day

[Kid Cudi:]
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me

[070 Shake:]
Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free


[Francis and the Lights:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know

[Kanye West:]
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say don't say this, don't say that
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it
So it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cake
Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm
If I wasn't signed to so hard there'd be no Shay
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay


[Slick Rick:]
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

[Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi:]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still like you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still like you

[Kanye West:]
Take the top off, let the sun come in
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Woah, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (yeah)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs "Turn the snubs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(The Lord still shines on you)
(Believe it or not)
These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not)
The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you (the Lord still shines on you)
Truth told, I like you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Too bold to type you
(Believe it or not)
Too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

[Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi:]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you


[070 Shake:]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', finding
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Kanye West:]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster
Not havin' mÃ©nages, I'm just being silly
I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas, but yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence, next she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[070 Shake & Ty Dolla Sign:]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Nicki Minaj:]
I'm sayin' it like...
I want a daughter like Nicki, aww man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no menagÃ©s
I don't know how you saying it, but let 'em hear this


[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist, you make me run out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Kanye West:]
They say, "Build your own"âI said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"âthey said, "How, 'Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all!"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Jeremih:]
When somethin frees
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run thru with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, oooh

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Kanye West:]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time something happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson but sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Choir / PARTYNEXTDOOR / Ty Dolla $ign:]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make me run out of my skin (run out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)

[Kanye West (Ty Dolla $ign):]
For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

And I know you wouldn't leave

Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help

I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye, fuck what they talk about
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help

Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

That's my bipolar shit, nigga what?
That's my superpower, nigga ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhhh!

[Kanye West:]
Something wrong
I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead!
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way heading up the stairs
To my surprise a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

All of the lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life
Every night

[Kanye West:]
Restraining order
Can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation
We met at Borders
Told her she take me back
I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes
I bumped my head
Courts sucked me dry
I spent that bread
She need a daddy
Baby, please, can't let her grow up in that ghetto university

All of the lights
Cop lights, flashlights, spot lights
Strobe lights, street lights
All of the lights
All of the lights
Fast life, drug life
Thug life, rock life

Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say was oh)
Whoa, whoa
(I tried to tell you but all I could say)


[Kanye West:]
Whose fault?

[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.

I'll call you bitch for short as a last resort and my first resort.
You call me motherfucker for long,
At the end of it you know we both were wrong.

But I love to play the blame game, I love you more.
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.

[Kanye West:]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
"I'd rather argue with you than be with someone else."
I took a piss and dismiss it like fuck it and I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings, yo I'd rather be by my fucking self
'Til about 2 AM and I call back and I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call her names, names, I hate you more.
Let's call her names, names for sure.

[Kanye West:]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom gripping you up fuckin' and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine

And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other nigga's stroking you
Lying, say I hit you,
He sitting there consoling you
Running my name through the mud
Who's provoking you
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 A.M. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone like what was I supposed to do
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point I had to stop asking questions
Chuck dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said Yeezy I ain't your right girl
You probably find one of them "I like art"âtype girls
All of her life, she was caught in the hype girl
And I was satisfied being in love with the lie
Then who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game...

[John Legend:]
Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.

[Kanye West:]
"Things used to be, now they're not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely."
âChloe Mitchell

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure.
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more.
Let's call out names, names, for sure.

I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much

And I know that you were somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just rang and rang
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing.
I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing...

["The Best Birthday" Chris Rock:]
Oh my God
Baby, you done took this shit to another motherfucking level
Now a neighbourhood nigga like me ain't supposed to be getting no pussy like this
God damn, God damn! Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never used to talk dirty, but now youâyou got damn disgusting,
Myâmy God, whereâwhere'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you motherfucking butt ass naked with them motherfucking Jimmy Choos on
Who taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level, this is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now, shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga, OK. And I, and I love it.
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How d'you learn, howâhow did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy taught me)
I was fucking parts of your pussy I've never fucked before
I was in there like, "Oh, shit, I've never been here before." I've never even seen this part of pussy town before.
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit. What the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy.
And when I see that nigga I'mma thank him.
I'mma buy the album, I'mma download that motherfucker I'mma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Oww, I still can't believe you got me this watch. This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted
Even with the bezel this is the motherfucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw that Twista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source
That's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?
(Yeezy taught me)
Yeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well.


[Nicki Minaj:]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't
The real one's far too mean
The watered-down one
The one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fiction
Sick addiction
Well gather round children
Zip it
Listen

[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher?
So high, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?
(You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rolling down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Kanye West and Bon Iver:]
At the mall there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(I saw the devil) In a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Teyana Taylor:]
Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Kanye West:]
I love it though
I love it though, you know

Uh put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

May the Lord forgive us
May the gods be with us
In that magic hour I seen good Christians make brash decisions
Oh she do it, what happened to Religion?
Oh she lose it
She putting on her make-up
She casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the Lebron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a Jumbotron
I'm looking at her like "this what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway, oh I forgot it's summertime

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
I know I'm preaching to the congregation
We love Jesus but she done learned a lot from Satan (Satan, Satan, Satan)
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married but tonight I need some consummation

When the sun go down it's the magic hour
The magic hour
And outta all the colours that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind
I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot that's how Mase screwed up
Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said, "You are what you eat."
You see I always loved that sense of humour
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme" not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me could you be more phony?

Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sinsation
Haven't said a word,
Haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Rick Ross:]
Lookin' at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sippin' RosÃ© all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry red chariot, excess is just my character
All black tux, nigga shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired
Before his jaw shattered climbin' up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', runnin' signs like they don't matter
Uh, hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin' so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps, I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique's appetite had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over
Gettin' 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps


[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West:]
Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag and tell me that it's random
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative

This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West:]
Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me

I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shooting a jump shot running a track meet
But this pimp is, at the top of mount Olympus
Ready for the World's game, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fish stick
I insisted to get up offa this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me of when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it

[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Kanye West:]
I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get into school
He said, "Take them glasses off and get in the pool."
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news."
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a black beetle anyway, a fucking roach
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fucking coach
My God said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
It's not funny anymore try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, x and o
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
Ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
Forgot about 2 things, my black balls

[Kid Cudi:]
Ain't no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Raekwon:]
I done copped Timb's, lived in lenses, kid
Armani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots and Benzes
Counting up, smoking, one cuff
Live as a red Jag, a Louis bag, grabbing a blunt, fuck it
Steam about a hundred and one Ls
Kites off the jails, buying sweats, running up in Stetson
Nigga hat game was special
It matched every black pair of Nikes
Throwing dice for decimals
The older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head
Make sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead
That meant code red
Bent off the black skunk
The black dutch, back of the old shed
If you can't live, you dying
You give or buy in
Keep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding
Keep shining, to every young man, this is a plan
Learn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye

[Kid Cudi:]
Not for nothing I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down


I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bitter-sweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes, huh!
Well, I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah!

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams,
Never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams,
Comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away."
How could you say they live they life wrong
When you never fuck with the lights on?

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me,
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and, baby, we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life


[Sample From "Woods": Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time

[2x]
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night

[Kanye West:]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma ma se, ma ma se, ma ma ku sa
Lost in this plastic life,
Let's break out of this fake ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms still get laid

(I'm lost in the world)
Run from the lights, run from the night,
(I'm down on my mind)
Run for your life,
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life,
I'm new in the city but I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said she's down for the night
I'm lost in the world, I'm down on my mind
I'm new in the city and I'm goin' for a ride
Goin' for a ride
I'm lost in the world, been down for my whole life
I'm new in the city but I'm down the for the night
Down for a night, down for a good time

[Gil-Scott Heron:]
Us living as we do upside down.
And the new word to have is revolution.
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued.
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey.
The youngsters who were programmed to continue fucking up woke up one night digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys.
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes.
The signs of truth were tattooed across our open ended vagina.
We learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal.
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault, hosed down daily with a gagging perfume.
America was a bastard, the illegitimate daughter of the mother country whose legs were then spread around the world and a rapist known as freedom, free doom.
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling in the mother country's crotch

What does Webster say about soul?
All I want is a good home and a wife
And our children and some food to feed them every night.
After all is said and done build a new route to China if they'll have you.

Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?


[Bon Iver:]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Whoa, just another lonely night

Question what do these things all have in common
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles
I kill a block I murder the avenues
I rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles' heel is
Love I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these niggas I've made millionaires
Milling about, spilling their feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Kanye West]

[Nicki Minaj:]
Pull up in the monster

With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka

You could be the King but watch the Queen conquer
OK first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'mma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hairdresser from Milan, that's the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
Let me get this straight wait I'm the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50k for a verse, no album out!
Yeah my money's so tall that my Barbie's gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate
Find it Tony Matterhorn dutty wine it
While it, Nicki on them titties when I sign it
Have these niggas so one-track minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
And I'll say Bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should mÃ©nage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give em whiplash
I think big get cash make em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Bon Iver:]
I-I crossed the line-line
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home
[Repeated]


Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey, hey, hey

I'm living in the 21st century doin' something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the power
21st century schizoid man

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rollin',
Huh? Motherfucker, we rollin'
With some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',
Huh? I'll see you in the mornin'
This is way too much, I need a moment.

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin'. I just count the hours
Stop trippin'. I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
21st century schizoid man

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my ass hole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!
You short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian,
My ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...

No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin' I just count the hours
Stop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
21st century schizoid man

[Verse 3]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation
At the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit
I know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick
I ain't got a power trip who you going home with?
How 'Ye doin'? I'm surviving
I was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'...

Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey
Hey, hey

[3x]
Now this'll be a beautiful death
[Dwele:]

I'm letting everything go

You got the power to let power flow

[Ad-lib]
21st century schizoid man

And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Baby I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Pusha T:]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it
All right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knock-offs, ha, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over Mai Tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

[Kanye:]
Never was much of a romantic,
I could never take the intimacy.
And I know I did damage,
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me,
I guess you knew in an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything.
And I don't know how I'mma manage,
If one day you just up and leave
And I always find yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the assholes,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'd never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Well, maybe y'all do
Or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care
It's how we on it all the time
So I'mma get my money
Let's go

[Kanye West:]
Now, I'mma need you to kill the hypocrisy
This is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolaty
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cool
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods!
That nigga crazy, I told you!
Immature adult (uh huh), insecure asshole (what else?)
And if you fall on the concrete, that's yo' ass fault
If you pass on a Kon beat, that's yo' last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that's yo' ass, so
She got a big booty, but she couldn't drop that ass low
'Til you take yo' last ho, and rope up all the cash flow
When you gettin' money, they be all up on yo' ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass go
Straight to jail, yo, in a hell hole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'im I say, "Hello."
Ask him if I'mma be there soon and tell 'im I said, "Hell, no!"
Yo, what you say when your people get out of jail, huh?

[BeyoncÃ© (Kanye West):]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything
Everything I want
(Let's go shopping dog, let's celebrate)
But I don't
No matter how good it gets

No women in the crowd
Screamin' and it's loud
Doin' things not allowed

Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I'm in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
Attention to detail is so uncanny
And the whip's on the Sprewells, it's so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Bonny's
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic, thirty-two
Lyrically, can't none of y'all murder 'Ye
'Cause y'all raps ain't got no vertebrae
I got style ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty's swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the diving board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here's something that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child's illusions become reality

[BeyoncÃ©:]
Now go get my throne
'Cause I don't wanna stop
I just go in my zone
And I'mma make it hot
'Til it's time to go
When it's time to go
Where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now
(Exactly!)

It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Kanye West:]
I'm so appalled, Spalding ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck about y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fucking hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean goddamn
One time let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
30,000 feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Jay-Z:]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fucking beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And 'Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost 30 mil, so I spent another 30
Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fucking insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fucking not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fucking ridiculous

[Kanye West:]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fucking ridiculous
Five star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man this shit is fucking ridiculous

[Pusha T:]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by 21
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watching it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove, leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spill it, I own you all, yeah

[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Cyhi The Prynce:]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment: "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the civil rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[RZA:]
Ayo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know the shit is fucking ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fucking ridiculous

[Swizz Beatz:]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous


Us living as we do upside-down
And the new word to have is revolution
People don't even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God's whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
The youngsters who were programmed
To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom, free-DOOM
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded, the bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin' bubblin'
In the mother country's crotch
What does Webster say about soul?
"All I want is a good home and a wife
And a children, and some food to feed them every night"
After all is said and done, build a new route to China if they'll have you
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
WHO WILL SURVIVE IN AMERICA?
[clapping]


It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Chorus]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

[Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind than what you call that (what you call that)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

[Outro]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

Didn't you know 
I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream

When you decide to break the rules

Let me ask you 
How long have you known too
You played it off and act like he's brand new

On lonely nights I start to fade 
(On lonely nights I start to fade) 
Her love is a thousand miles away 
(Her love is a thousand miles away) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again 

Memories made in the coldest winter 

It's 4am and I can't sleep

Can it melt away all of our mistakes 
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes) 
Memories made in the coldest winter 
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again 

Never Again


In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so cold
As the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why would she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talking talking talking talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So why I got something new to see?
And you just gon' keep hating me
And we just gon' be enemies

I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless 
How could you be so heartless 
Oh, how could you be so heartless?


I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-no!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose


[Intro: Kanye West]
Why are you so paranoid
Don't be so paranoid

Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Verse 1]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight oh here we go
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you

[Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do

Anyway they don't know you like I do

Wise men say
Wise men say
Wise men say
The baddest niggas out there bro
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

Its so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what real love is about

Do you think I sacrificed real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy

Its funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing

What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina...
For everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'
You all that
I just want to be a real boy,
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes...

And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more,
I cant find her no more I cant...
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream

And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream,
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the TV screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what-tf for a real boy

They say Kanye you keep it too real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say


[Verse 1]
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen 
Straight up out a movie scene 
Who knew she was a drama queen 
That a turn my life to Stephen King 
Up late night like she on patrol 
Checking everything like I'm on parole 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now 
Ok, Ok, Ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it 

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop 
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop 
Now I don't need no Robocop 

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history 
You like the girl from Misery 
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree 
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on 
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on 
I told her some things she don't need to know 
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You never stop it now 
Ok, ok, ok, ok 
You will never stop it now 
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it 

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop 
You moving like a Robocop 
When did you become a Robocop 
Somebody please make her stop 

[Verse 3]
Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I 
Ain't used to being told stop 
So I could never be your robot 
Fast or slow you can stay or can go 
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know 
Yea I had her before but that happened before 
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more 
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh 
It ain't ok, ok, ok

[Outro]
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just and LA girl
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl (you need to stop it now)
Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Ha ha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
You need to stop it now
Oh you need to stop it now


Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleepless til noon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey hey hey hey 
Don't say you will
Then play you will
I pray you will

Mrs. So-Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will
Hey hey hey hey 
Don't say you will
One day you will
I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey 
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you
About you

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey 
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will

The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting

In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and

Life's just not fair


[Verse 1]
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh

[Chorus:]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho

[Verse 2]
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before

[Verse 3]
My god sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho

And I can't, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop

Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no

Can't stop having these visions

[Kanye West]
Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They cant stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I cant even explain it
I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Hook - Kanye West]
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!

[Kanye West]
Dude!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
Cos my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted
You should go head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!
And Mr. West is so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby

[Lil Wayne]
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
Iâm so fucking good like Iâm sleeping with Megan
Iâm all about my franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hayvic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cos I'm so at it
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice
and I don't lack shit
And you can get Barried
Suck my bat bitch

[Chorus - Kanye West]
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby

[Lil Wayne]
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on
Wit something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, man here's another hit, Barry Bonds

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)


Staduim status
Uh

My big brother was Big's brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D My mentor
Now let the story begin

Its the hard knock life tour
Sell out, picture us in the mall
Coping iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yea that's what we would yell out
Yell out
You know the name dude
I gotta spell out or tell bout
J a y an Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime
Let the chance pass by
Back of my mind he could change your life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you could brag to your friends back at the gig
But he got me out my mama crib
Then he help me get my mama a crib

Big brother was Bigs Brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hop brother
Who was No I.D friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Fresh off the plane I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out
I'm about to take mine
Around the same time of that BluePrint 1
Any beats in my pocket was that Blueprint form
I'd play my little song in that old back room
He would bob his head and say, damn, oh, that's you
But by the Black album I was blacking out
Party at S.O.Bs and we had packed the crowd
Big brother got his show up in Madison Square
And I'm like yea, yea we gonna be there
But not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinking a little different
Kept little brother at bay, at a distance
Put everything I felt was more focused
Only made me more focused
Only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the todum
Now I'm at the top and everybody on the scrodum

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
Now let the story begin
Begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the presidito
Hola ovito
The game getting foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peep hole
Then I dropped Jesus walks now I'm on a steep hole
And we know
New jack city gotta keep my brother
But to be number 1 I'm a beat my brother
On that diamond remix I swore I spaz
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivery, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was driving me
At the Grammies I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kick a flow it was like, pick and roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go
I guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
but I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna minggle yo.
Ya know
I told Jay I did a song with cold play
Next thing I know he got a song with coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like damn, no way
Translate espanol
No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay brown
Should of known that was gonna come back around
Should of told you like a man should of told you first
But I told somebody else that's what made shit worse

My big brother was Bigs brother
So here's a few words from your kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go ahead and tell um
People never get the flowers while they could smell um
A ideal in my eyes, God of the game
Heart of the city,Rockafella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number 1 young Hov also my big brother

My big Brother was Bigs brother
Used to be Dame and Bigs Brother
Who was hip hops brother
Who was No I.Ds friend
No I.D my mentor
And that's where the story ends

Don't kill this shit.....


[Chorus]
[John Mayer:]
Bittersweet
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and hate you at the very same time
Bittersweet

[Verse 1:]
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of those bad nights, ya'll have a bad fight
And you talking 'bout her family, her aunts and shit
And she say "Motherfucker, yo momma's a bitch!"
You know, domestic drama and shit, all that attitude
I'll never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit outta you!
But I'mma be the bigger man, Big Pimpin' like Jiggaman
Oh I guess I figure it's...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency
And my nigga said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking and
This relationship it even got me back to drinking all this
Hennessy
It's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having our child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Cuz every time I would try, you would question me
Saying "You fucking them girls, disrespecting me?
You don't see how ya lies is affecting me.
You don't see how our life was supposed to be.
And I never let a nigga get that close to me.
And you ain't cracked up to what you was supposed to be.
You always gone, you'll always be where them hoes'll be."
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me

[Chorus]
[Kanye:]
I fucked up and I know it g
I guess it's bittersweet poetry

[Bridge x2]
See what I want so much, shit never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now, this is an emergency

[Chorus]


La, la, la, la wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosbys I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La, la, la, la wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking about "back in my day"
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it

They say I talk with so much emphasis
Oh, they're so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

La, la, la, la wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes
'Cause how he move in a room full of nos?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure. What's your pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada
Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like "Why God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

La, la, la, la wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la, la then you can't tell me nothing right
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing
(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing
Uh, uh, you can't tell me nothing

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
I'm serious nigga, I got money


[Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
La La La La (87, 32 that's the way it go, Kanye and Jizzle say it ain't so) 
Wait till I get my money right

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
If I had a billion dollars (YEAHHHHHHHHHH)

Top floor penthouse I'll show 'em where i stay (stay)
Grand piano, might learn to play (Ha Ha!)
Need a hundred grand just to past me everyday (Woo! Woo!)
You know i like them white keys on it (yea!)
Duck tape when we wrap them
Call me prejudice, cuz i never touch the black ones (keys that is, Ha Ha!)
Let me show how to do this shawty (shawty)
I hit the strip club and I blew bout forty (DAMN!)
Patron got me so confused (fused)
Until I stumbled outside and I made the news
Fresh nine piece, yeah them wings is cajun
Never seen me in the kitchen nigga, I am amazing (nah)
Well, fuck it I'm rich then
If balling is a crime, fuck it I'm hit then
If Thugging is a term, fuck it I'm it then
The insane dough, hey, fuck it I'm sick then
Somebody call me a shrink
Until then, Ima fix me a drink (Ha Ha!)
Top down in the bit, I'm so intoxicated
Sometimes I think to myself "god damn, I made it"
And I know they hate it
On the all night flight
Tryna get my money right
Wassup?

[Chorus: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
La La La La (Hey!)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
Yea, yea
Yea, homie this a theme song
First I get my money right
Then I get my team on
If I always pray to have gleam on
$300 jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a lil jet
Fly as the insect, even though we ended
And it don't matter if I get her number cuz
When I get my money right she gon come running
And I'll be good like "God" with an extra "O"
God knows that my check needs some extra 0's
And you know that you need to bring some extra hoes
Not in jogging pants either, tell them wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional
And my chain so fresh, they go (oh oh oh oh oh)
Right after the fame did you gain anything?
Damn Ye, would you change anything?
But (If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
I'd copped more pink polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname Sorrow
My Benz need company, her nickname tahoe
âWait till i get my moneyâ everybody motto
So Ima need a bravo for everything I wrote
Yeah, hey mama they can't hate him
Cuz after all of the drama, K slayed them

[Chorus: Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
La La La La (Hey!)
Wait till I get my money right
La La La La (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing (HA HA!)
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Kanye West (Young Jeezy)]
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Wait till I get my money right
(If I had a billion dollars YEAHHHHHHHHHH)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?


[chorus:]
(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
Yes I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a little somethin' show you how we live
Everybody want it but it ain't that serious
That's that shit
So if you're gonna do it, do it just like this
(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)

You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just wanted better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But everytime I want it, layaway or a deposit
My dad'll say "When you see clothes close your eyelids"
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'cause every summer he'll get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd sent me back to school with a new wardrobe and hey!

[chorus]

When it feel like living's harder than dyin'
For me givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill say her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'cause who the kids gonna listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD then got to see me drop gems
Like I dropped out of P.E.
They used to feel invisible
Now they know they invincible

(Did you realize
That you were a champion?
In their eyes)
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
This is the story of a champion
Rounders in the mob and they pop the guns
Stand up stand up! Here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number one?
Tell me what it takes to be number one?

Ra ra ra ra ra ra... brrraaa


Oh oh oho.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh oho.
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,

now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.

I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and I'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the India.Arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am


Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
She don't believe in shootin' stars,
but she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment,
couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit,
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the h'orderves, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,
man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me,
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

[Kanye West]
I know it's been a while,
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay,
a-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
it'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum,
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,
come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

As you recall, you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights
What do you know? Flashing lights, lights

Flashing lights, lights
Flashing lights, lights

Lights, lights, lights, lights...

Now throw your hands up in the sky
I g-go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

[Chorus - T-Pain:]
I'm gonna get on this TV mama, I'm gonna
I'm gonna put shit down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, I'm good

[Verse 1 Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life
Where niggas that sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living' spree
Shit they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ah
(Now throw your hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo it's got to be cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

[Hook:]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw your hands up in the sky

[Chorus - T-Pain]

[Verse 2 Kanye West]
Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
Cause they got more (Ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it coming' with the bottles
Till she feel boozed like she bombed out Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Ye
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life

Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish?
(I wish a nigga would)
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
50 told me go 'head switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up, the good life

[Hook]

[Chorus - T-Pain]

[Verse 3]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting' some brain
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get biz
Having' money's not everything, not having it is
I was splurging' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas cause
I always had a passion for flashing' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine, the good life

[T-Pain]
Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feeling' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good


Good morning [x4]

Wake up, Mr. West, Mr. West, Mr. Fresh
Mr. by-his-self-he-so-impressed
I mean, damn, did you even see the test
You got D's mother fucker, D's, Rosie Perez
And yes, barely pass any and every class
Looking at every ass
Cheated on every test
I guess this is my dissertation
Homie, this shit is basic
Welcome to graduation

Good morning

Good morning
On this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like a fly Malcolm X
Buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets of the league
From an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain
Look how far we done came
Haters saying ya changed
Now ya doing ya thing

Good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning

Good morning
Look at the valedictorian scared of the future
While I hop in the Delorean
Scared-to-face-the-world complacent career student
Some people graduate, but we still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach us, teach us, Jesus
Okay, look up now, they done stole your streetness
After all of that, you receive this

Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning
Hustlers, that's if you're still living
Get on down

Get on down
Get, get on down
Get on down
Get, get on down


[Bridge - Mos Def] 
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Verse - Kanye West] 
Right now I can see it so vivid 
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it 
Me and my grandparents on a field trid-ip 
And I'm the little kid tryna touch the exhibits 
But it'll fade before I get to get a hold of that 
Man I wish I could stop time like a photograph 
Every joke that they told I'd know to laugh 
Man, man I wouldn't let a moment pass 
What do it mean when you dream that you fallin' 
What do it mean when you dream that you ballin' 
What do it mean when you never dream at all then 
And you don't really know cause you can't recall them 
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say hi to 
People you never got a chance to say bye to 
Maybe you could pull em up outta your dreams 
Into real life, if you try to 
So close, but so far 
And so far, no cigar 
We can't dwell on the past all we got is today 
So I'mma live like there's no tomorrow 
No goodbye 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Verse - Al Be] 
Uhh, to you 
If I part my heart will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 
My art will live through you 
Dream beautiful and unusual 
Wake up like everyday new to you 
Stay true to you, a hood musical 

[Chorus - Mos Def] 
I don't wanna say goodbye to you 
So I'll just say good night to you 
My people, no goodbyes to you 
I'm just gonna say good night 

[Bridge - Mos Def x3]
I'm not sure anymore-more 
Who is knocking at my door-door 
All the faces that I know 
Ja make them so sunny and true


[Kanye West:]
And you say Chi city, Chi city, Chi city

[Chris Martin:]
I'm coming home again.
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again.

[Kanye West:]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She said, "Excuse me little homie,
I know you don't know me,
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"
And from that point I never blow her off,
Niggas come from outta town I like to show her off,
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off,
And make 'em straighten up their hat, 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
And at nighttime her face lit up so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, "It felt like they walked and drove on me."
Knew I was gang-affiliated got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, "'Ye keep making that, keep making that platinum and gold for me!"

[Chris Martin:]
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

[Kanye West:]
But if you really cared for her,
Then you wouldn't never hit the airport
To follow your dream,
Sometimes I still talk to her,
But when I talk to her it always seems
Like she talking about me,
She said, "You left your kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you,
But they just not you," and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you making you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around,
If you don't know by now, I'm talking about Chi Town,

[Chris Martin:]
I'm coming home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
I'm in home again
Maybe, do you remember when fireworks at lake Michigan
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we can start again

Coming home again
Coming home again
Maybe we can start again


Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

I've been waiting on this my whole life
These dreams be waking me up at night
You say I think I'm never wrong
You know what, maybe you're right, aight

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

You say he get on your fucking nerves
You hope that he get what he deserves, word
Do you even remember what the issue is
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet
And that's what the intuition is
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib
Run back to their arms
The smokescreens
The chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really mean

And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams

And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline
Told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's what I'm
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hot lines
Why he keep giving me hot lines
I'm a star, how could I not shine
How many ladies in the house
How many ladies in the house without a spouse
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused
What you about
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean
You ever wonder if you'll find your dreams


Work it, make it, do it,
Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger!

[played in background, continuously:]
Work it harder, make it better,
do it faster, makes us stronger,
more than ever, hour after,
Our work is never over.

[Chorus:]
Na-na-na that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
'Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
'Cause I can't get much wronger
Man I've been waitin' all night now
That's how long I've been on you

I need you right now
I need you right now

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say right?
Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
'cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead go nuts go ape shit
Especially in my pastel on my bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New gospel homie, take six, and take this, haters

[Chorus]

I need you right now
I need you right now

Me likey

I don't know if you got a man or not,
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me

So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?
Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Chorus]

I need you right now
I need you right now

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you [x6]
Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

[Chorus]

I need you right now [x4]

You know how long I've been on you?
Since Prince was on Appolonia
Since OJ had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told you
Never told you [x4]

Never over [x8]


"I got fury in my soul,

Class back in session so I up't it a grade
Two years the Dwayne Wayne became the Dwyane Wade
And A
Please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the barkers, I'm hood like parkers
While you all was in limbo I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game rock a chain stead of a wedding ring
You all brides maids catch the garter
On nights when romance
Cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common my man
After each and every show a couple dykes in the van
It's easy
The hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy and o yeah yeezy

Man the game all messed up
How I suppose to stand out when everyone get dressed up
So yeah at the Grammies I went ultra Travolta
Yeah that tuxedo might have been a little gweedo
But with my ego, I can stand there with a speedo
And still be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory the story the chain the polo the Nike the chronic
Empty bottles of no do's
Tank on empty whipping my mamma's Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logo's
The furrest man that shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that to door cost
House on the hill
Two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking about her girlfriends yeah the dark skinned ones
She asking about the speed boats yeah I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person what does it feel like
I know, I know I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to BIG a lot
You know BIG and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live I wanna be compared to BIG
Anyone big pun big l or notorious
Fit in
Get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna start killin' these niggas as soon as the chorus hit

[chorus sample]

For my theme song, my leather black jeans on
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom but watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking. Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your ass

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
(Ready, ready for action)

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we're livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Breeze
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
Breeze
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Breeze
Yeah I told you to wait
Breeze

So I'mma need a little more time now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Breeze
Yeah, I thought you could wait
Breeze

These bitches surroundin' me
Black bodies
All want somethin' out me
Swinging in the southern breeze

Then they talk about me
Breeze
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Strange fruit hanging
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
From the poplar trees
Now I know you naughty
From the poplar trees
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly

And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me

Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you

Black bodies
Before the glory
Swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
I know there ain't wrong with me

Strange fruit hanging
Something strange's happening
From the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

You could've been somebody
We could've, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly

And came out of our body
And came out of our body

Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the Nola

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Black bodies
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Swinging in the southern breeze
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Breeze
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse

Now you sittin' courtside
Wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated
I call that apartheid

Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that

Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got

On and on that alimony
She got you homie
'Til death but do your part
Unholy matrimony

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze

Blood on the leaves
Breeze breeze
And breeze

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1:]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turned the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 2:]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound

[Verse:]
Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka

[Bridge: Popcaan]

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I can hold my liquor
This man can't handle me
But this man can't handle his weed
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on in Indiana
I'm heard on the radio now

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Verse: Kanye West]
Bitch I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla
Okay, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya, one more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over, Yeezy's all on you sofa, these the red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover, even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us
Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor, after that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
When he's sober it's over and bitch, I'm back out my coma

[Bridge + Hook]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Outro: Justin Vernon and Kanye West]
I heard you need a new fad
I heard you need a new stack
I heard you need a new phone
I know your 'rents ain't be home
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh on the phone

I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn mÃ©nage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of god
My whole life in the hands of god
So y'all better quit playing with god

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions."
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm giving up. I'm a god


[Kanye West:]
Damn your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bath water on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hands, legs, eatin' ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, lot of bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Agent Sasco:]
That's all them can do (say wah, say wah)
That's all them can do
We deal with action thing
Just a badman thing a dat dem cab do
Action thing yo a badman thing

Man a badman you fi know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way Jose
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's hard, couldn't try that no day
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like a aerosol can)
When we roll round 'pon your block
Nuh bother feel say we won't spray (like an aerosol can)
We ago smile pan court day
Because we beat murder charge like O.J

[Kanye West & Justin Vernon:]
That's right I'm in it (Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it (Stepping on tacks on the floor)
That's right (And boys at your door)
That's right I'm in it (Well you need to fight for your own)
That's right I'm in it (Then don't let me at your table)
I'm in it (If you just gonna lay there)
Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars
I'll be gone long, grab thatÂ  [?] set yourÂ  [?]

[Kanye West:]
Picked up where we left off
I need you home when I get off
You know I need that wet mouth
I know you need that reptile
She cut from a different textile
She love different kinds of sex now
Black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
That's why I'm in it and I can't get out (That's all them can do)
Lay it off, it off, it off.
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Star fucker,
Who? Where?

[Kanye West:]
Time to take it too far now
Michael Douglas out the car now
The kids and the wife life
But can't wake up from the night life
I'm so scared of my demons
I go to sleep with a nightlight
My mind move like a Tron bike
Pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
I'm gonna start a new movement
Being led by the drums
I'm a rap-lic priest
Getting head by the nuns
They don't play what I'm playing
They don't see what I'm saying
They be balling in the D-League
I be speaking Swaghili


[Verse 1:]
My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Hook:]
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2:]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm about to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that private owned prison
Get your piece today
They Probably all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout their maid
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?


[Verse 1:]
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
The monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)

[Hook:]
On sight
On sight

How much you wanna give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up

[Bridge:]
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

[Verse 2:]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

[Hook:]
On sight
On sight

[Outro:]
Ugh, huh
Right now, right now
I need, I need
Right now


[King Louie:]
Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Kanye West:]
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[King Louie:]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Beenie Man:]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have


[Verse 1: Teyana Taylor]
Ooh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm the kind of girl who loves her diamonds and white pearls
So tempt me to jetset away in London
To sip on some tea, you surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ohh (La la la la la la la la)
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you's all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is

[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss

[Verse 2: John Legend]
I remember when the pilot closed the door
Said it's time for lift off
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
But don't ever wonder
Cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top
You'll never question why you left
Oh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is

[Hook: John Legend & Teyana Taylor]
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets
(Kiss kiss kiss kiss)
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss


[Intro]
What of the dollar you murdered for

Or your brotherâs the one that youâre running from
But if you got money, fuck it, 'cause I want some

B.I.G.
Fucking with me
Oh god

[Hook â Big Sean:]
Ainât nobody fuckinâ with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique

Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

[Verse 1 â Big Sean:]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say

She tryna get me that poo tang
I might let my crew bang
My crew deeper than Wu Tang
Iâm rolling with (Huh) fuck Iâm saying?
Girl, you know my crew name

Young player from the D thatâs killinâ everything that he see

[Hook]

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah am talking Yeâ, yeah am talking Rihâ, yeah Iâm talking B, nigga Iâm talking me

Now who with me? Â¡VÃ¡monos! Call me Hov or jefe
Translation, Iâm the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ainât hug his son since the second grade
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole
Itâs the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing
You ainât fuckinâ with my clique

[Hook]

[Kanye West:]
Break records at Louis
Ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie

What niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah Iâm talking business
We talking CIA
Iâm talking George Tenet
I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach
Think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money donât spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go igânant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now Iâm looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
Thatâs Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasnât really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew presence
Speed Boat swerve homie, watch out for the waves
Iâm way too black to burn from sun rays
So I just meditated the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time Iâm in Vegas they screaming like heâs Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelinâ Isrealian
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no that's Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my mamma passed
Suicide what kind of talk is that
But Iâve been talking to God for so long
That if have you look in my life I guess he talking back
Fuckinâ with my clique

Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to meet me without no drawers?

[Verse 1]
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you mahfuckas it was more than the music
In the projects one day, to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talking, we're used to it
I'm from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
To whoever think their words affect me is too stupid
And if you can do it better than me, then you do it!
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don't talk about style cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
And the whole industry want to fuck your old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim
Around the same time she had fell in love with him
Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang
Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team
La Familia, Roc Nation
We in the building, we still keep it basement
We flyer than a parakeet, floatin' with no parachute
Six thousand dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don't talk about style cause I'll embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me 'fore I embarrass you
GOOD Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, let me ask this quest'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Don't talk to me 'bout style, nigga, I'll mothafuckin' embarrass you

And they think they know, and they think they know
They deal it for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch trying to take my mind off my grip
If I had one wish it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme, throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed I stand alone
Alone I'll be, heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
Work it, work it, work it, for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin' on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga

Yeah, I see you waitin' over there
See you jockin' over there
See you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout this girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Turn my head and hey

Thinkin' bout your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young, you dig?

Make bitches act out of spite, aiight
Oh momma, I got that bomb

But the white girls say, "Where you get that cool beat from?"

[Hook: The Dream]
She love it (She love it)
Every beat of the drum, she sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it
She love it (She love it)

Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Yeah, I've been known to chase 'em
Known to replace 'em
Shoe game outta this world, I outer space 'em
Known to have a hundred and one, like Dalmatians
Maybe if she special enough, I'll glass case her
Get caught cheating and I gotta let you stick me up
Let you shop 'til you drop as a pick-me-up
Bergdorf bandit, Barnies for the burglary
But these bands lift the whole store like Hercules
Get raunchy in Givenchy, my palm reads
Passports Pinot Noir in arm's reach
Paddle shiftin', push-button, no car keys
The penthouses are poolside with palm trees

[Hook: The Dream]
She love it (She love it)
Every beat of the drum, she sprung
She say I make her wanna touch it
She love it (She love it)
She make me wanna touch it

[Verse 2: Mase]
Uh, one-two one-two guess who back again
Uh, Harlem in this-what? Yeezy let Manhattan in
Get my mic right, turn my levels up
Get the light right, turn my bezel up
You hear the bounce on it, go and throw your mouth on it
So many ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted
Long as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with
They wanna garnish my earnings before I send it I burn it
You know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed
Her Louis seven inch, they TMZ me through my tint
I bumped into Loon he like, "Well, as-salamu alaykum"
You know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon
The shot niggas takin' you'd think I'm rollin' 'round with Reagan
A Mexican landscape and come rake in what I'm makin'
Think you blew me up with your bougie butt
But you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up
I'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard
It's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know the Lord
Already wrote it off, so just ignore the cost
So when I'm rollin' off I'm showin' off with no remorse
Sh'mon

[Hook: The Dream]
We buzzin', yeah
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker
Higher than a motherfucker, yeah

Gotcha knocked out, now you know you're smokin' loud
You're higher than a motherfucker
High in this bitch, high as a motherfucker

Moment of silence for this motherfucker

Fraud niggas, yâall niggas, thatâs that shit I donât like
Your shit, make believe, rapping âbout my own life
Thatâs rare nigga, Ric Flair nigga
The powerâs in my hair nigga, I get it, beat the chair nigga
SoHo, or Tribeca, three hoes, trifecta
Dope money, coke money, Hublot, my watch better
My penâs better, you donât write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or Kâs vomit, ungrateful niggas, I donât like

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They smile in my face is what I donât like
They steal your whole sound thatâs a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathinâ like they found Mike
A girlâll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phifer
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eatinâ good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissinâ girls, cause itâs hot right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ainât about that life, they ainât about that life
We hanginâ out that window itâs about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, J Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louis, this is Chi, right?

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
A bitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like
Sneak disser, thatâs that shit I donât like
Donât like, like, donât like, like
A snitch nigga, thatâs that shit I donât like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Fake Gucci, thatâs that shit I donât like
Smokinâ on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gonâ love me now, she gonâ let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, thatâs that nigga that I like
I donât want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, thatâs the shit that I donât like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I spend on a bunch of clothes, cause Iâm livinâ life
I come up on the scene, and Iâm stealinâ light
bitch Iâm high off life, got me feelinâ right

And bitch we GBE, we just gonâ cite

Yo ass been doinâ the same, shit, not doinâ what you sayinâ
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fuckinâ a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blow, blang, my niggas holdinâ that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, ridinâ for my niggas and thatâs for life
High class Iâm just surrounded by these low-lifes
And I run this bitch like itâs no lights
Goinâ hard the whole night cause I ainât goinâ back to my old life, I promise

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, thatâs that shit I donât like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowinâ up my phone, thatâs that bitch I donât like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on âem just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, ânother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas

[Hook]


Well, it is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound
Believe! Believe!

Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this every day-day?

Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve)
Believe! Believe! (swerve)

[Pusha T:]
Yeah, it's prime time, my top back, this pimp game hoe
I'm red leather, this cocaine, I'm Rick James hoe
I'm bill droppin', Ms. Pacman is pill poppin' ass hoe
I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemars like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time and that's excellence
Two door preference
Roof gone George Jefferson
That white frost on that pound cake
So your Duncan Hines is irrelevant
Lambo, Murcielago, she go wherever I go
Wherever we go we do it pronto

[2x]
Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)
With your girl she tryna jerk me (swerve)

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
It is - when it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve)
Believe! Believe! (swerve)

Well it is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth
In the dance hall, and who no have teeth will run upon them gums
Caw when time it comes to my sound, which is the champion sound
The bugle has blown the many times, and it still have one more time left
Caw the amount of stripe we have upon our shoulder

[Kanye West:]
Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or I'mma quit"
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus you're my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like DalÃ­
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[2 Chainz:]
(2 Chainz)
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid
Grade A, A1,
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack rhyming
Co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand
I make it rain, she want more showers
Rain pourin',
All my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign,
Money tall like Jordan

[2x]
Lamborghini Mercy (swerve)
Your chick she so thirsty (swerve)
I'm in that two-seat Lambo (swerve)

It is a weeping, and a moaning, and a gnashing of teeth (swerve)
When it comes to my sound which is the champion sound (swerve)
Believe! Believe! (swerve)


[Chorus]
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Pusha T 1:]
I believe there's a God above me
I'm just the God of everything else
I put hoes in everything else
New God Flow, fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer, write it in BOLD LETTERS
They love a nigga spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha ain't fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the yay as a wholeseller
I think it's good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper, matched with a cold killer
I came up more, for more than just to rhyme with him
Think '99, when Puff would've had Shyne with him
(matching Daytona's Rose Gold on us)
Going Ham in Ibiza done took a toll on us
Well since you over do it, imma pour more
Well if you going coupe, I'm going four door(wooo)

[Chorus]
Shake that body, party that body(that's rare nigga)
Shake that body, party that body(Ric Flair nigga)
Shake that body, party that body(yeah nigga)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D(yeah)

Shake that body, party that body(woaa)
Shake that body, party that body(woaa)
Shake that body, party that body(it's a New God Flow)
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

[Pusha T 2:]
Step on they necks till they can't breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by three's
Lined them all up and let's just see
Fuck 'em Ye, fuck 'em Ye
I wouldn't piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier'
They shit is shopping at Target'
My shit is luxury Balmain
I'm Balling, I'm all red
A nick sold in the park then I want in
What's a king without a crown nigga
What's a circus without you clown niggas
What's a brick from an outta town nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas
It's the GOOD Music golden child
M-A dollar sign can't nobody hold me down

[Chorus]
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

Hold up, I ain't trying to stunt, man
But these new Yeezys jumped over the jump man
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess that's a feeling only me and Lebron know
I'm living three dreams:
Biggie Smalls', Dr. King's, Rodney King's
Cause we can't get along, no resolution
Till we drown all these haters, rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww man, you sold your soul
Naww man, mad people was frontin'
Aww man, made something from nothing
Picture working so hard, and you can't cut through
That can mess up your whole life, like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to, I'm from the 312
Where cops don't come through and dreams don't come true
Like "Where did God go?" In his Murcielago
From working McDonald's, barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend, 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot, you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes, follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane?
Did strippers not make an ark when I made it rain?
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame?
And went to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains?
In Jesus name, let the choir say
"I'm on fire ay," that's what Richard Pryor say
And we annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know, they admire Ye

[Chorus]
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Shake that body, party that body
Come and have a good time with G-O-D

GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music, GOOD Music
And all my niggas say, GOOD Music
And all my ladies say, GOOD Music
I don't know what I've been told
(I don't know what I've been told)
If you get fresh, you get all the hoes
(If you get fresh, you get all the hoes)
I'm way fresher than all my foes
(I'm way fresher than all my foes)
Somebody please pick out they clothes
(Somebody please pick out they clothes)
And all my niggas say, GOOD Music
And all my ladies say, GOOD Music
Who running shit today, GOOD Music
Who running shit today, GOOD Music


[Travis Scott]
10 a.m. it's west side bitch
She see the glasses, so obvious
Run from home, after tonight we up out of here
Don't go home cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth, but can't eat right
Don't read between the line and forgot how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar letters devour this
She stepped into hell, cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, cause you'll never know
Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I'm here with open arms and I gotta
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs to me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go
Without her, this is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
Here is where her heart

[Break: Teyana Taylor & John Legend]
I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away

[Malik Yusef]
You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city

[CyHi Da Prynce]
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, warm tie like a ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggaz see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is
And he never hung with the Saints it makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen

[Chorus]

[Malik Yusef]
And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss', but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost feel like
Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as life


[Intro]
Stutterinâ
Givinâem rest and makinâ love again
In my best I be the run again
And I have the man dem stutterinâ

[Hook]
Iâm getting this nigga in the morning
He gonâ think he been chiefin just too long when
He see me in the eveninâ
Want to catch all these feelin
Well let me be the first to get mine

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittinâand countinâ, smoking a spliff, this shitâs a gift
All my niggas watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling ââWhat up?ââ
The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell itâs a statement
One freeze of this shit, you wonât feel your legs kid
Iâm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yellinâ Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say âYe with 2 Chainz on, we Common, letâs Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock Iâm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the âRari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryinâ to see through the mist of it
Could have been livinâ it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair
Yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so its
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In God we trust, the game is all us
Tilâ the sky calls or its flames on us
Push

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz
Iâm chillinâ in my camo, flippinâ through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logoâs a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo
Ammunition Iâm pitchinâ to make your body switch another position

[Verse 5: CyHi da Prynce]
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
Its tickelinâ when I hear what haters be whisperinâ
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ainât never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you canât spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said Iâd be inside a graveyard
Canât wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card

[Break: Dâbanj (Kanye West, Kid Cudi)]
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(You sold your soul)
Yeah, you feelinâ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was frontinâ
Aw man, made something from nothing)

[Outro: Kanye West]
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. wouldâve been God except I added more oâs
If I knew she was cheatinâ Iâd stillâve bought her more clothes
âCause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallinâ for
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontinâ
God damn, we made something from nothing


[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'ma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm the one, baby
Yeah, I'm the one, baby
Since God gave his only begotten son, baby
It's hard preachin' the gospel to the slums lately
So I had to put the church on the drums, baby
You on a run, baby
You on a run, baby
You think you free but you a slave to the funds, baby
You think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
Mhm that's cool but I been runnin' on the sun, baby
We on a galaxy that haters cannot visit
That's my reality so get off my Scott Disick
If you ever held a title belt you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan - Michael Phelps
Yeah, had to take it to another realm
Cause everything around me got me underwhelmed
Best way to describe my position is at the helm
Best way to describe my new whip - Yeeeaaaalmmp

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'ma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I told Detroit I'ma fuckin' get it
I told my brother we'll be fuckin' winnin'
Ye told me I'm the man for the job
So I told my mom, call her's up and tell 'em that she quittin'
Started off in that Chevrolet, but it's Ferraris I gotta drive
I'm on HBO with my Entourage
I'm 5'9" fuck a 9 to 5
I need a hundred million no compromise
I'm a double XL nigga
Magazine and condom size
See what I seen and be traumatized
I don't wait, I marinate, variate erryday
Erry state, sold out, fuck around and need a barricade
My weed loud I need a hearing aid
Livin' life behind a pair of shades
I be a billionaire if I could get a dollar
For all the bullshit that I hear a day
I did it

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
The storm is on the horizon
I'm standing here alone
Got a pistol on my hip
And it's gonna be some shit
If you want it then bring it on
See I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
And I'ma be here till it's done
And when they asking who I'm is, shit
You just tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one
(One, one, one)
Tell them that I'm the one

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Treat the back seat like a sofa bed
Break bread with my niggas, call it profit share
This some good shit, but it get better
And yeah my bitch cold, nigga thin sweater
Like my verse suede and the beat leather
Just tryin' to stay above sea level
When my nigga went to jail, I said, "Free Gucci"
I done bought so much shit, I should get free Gucci
Bought my baby momma anaconda bags
I shouldn't have bought it all
I should've went and cut the grass
Snake ass niggas in my fuckin' face
Bring your girl here nigga so I could fuck her face
Yeah I run this place, this is cash mill swag
niggas treadmillin' goin' nowhere fast
Sittin' courtside at the Hawks game
Louie's on, I could trip a fuckin' ball player

[Outro: James Fauntleroy (x2)]
fuck yeah, awesome, yeah I lost some of my mind
And then I found weed was really kind of awesome
It's possible, goddamn right
I've been honest the whole time


[Intro: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up
To the world, I made up in my mind
I'm doin' things my way, I'm burnin' shit down tonight
I'm doin' things my way, it's my way or the highway
Let me say it one more time

[Hook: R. Kelly]
Let me see you put your middle fingers up

Throw it up, throw it up

Funny how they wait 'til you gone just to miss you
To the world, to the world
Then I'm on my Sinatra, I'm doing it my way,
Let's take it a notch up, take it up
Let me see you put your middle fingers up!
To the world, I made up in my mind
Doing things my way, I'm burning shit down tonight

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Mmm ain't this some shit? Pulled up in the A-V-entador
And the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord
Did the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score
This a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola
I need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that
Said I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs
Like, "These niggas tryna hold me back
These niggas tryna hold me back", I'm just trying to protect my stacks
Mitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax
Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back
Only nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?
"Ease up there baby boy", Ving Rhames told Jody that
R. Kelly and the God of rap

Ay ay, here you go, my middle finger
To the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon

Give it up, give it up, won't let you deny me
Makin' you love me, makin' you love me

[Kanye West:]
It was all good just a week ago
niggas feel theyselves and then Watch The Throne drop

What niggas gon do Hov?
This a new crack on a new stove
I'm in the two-door, true that
niggas tellin' me "You back"
Like a nigga ever left up out this bitch, huh?
and if life a bitch suck my dick huh?
and I bet she fucked the whole clique, huh
By the way nigga, you should fuckin' quit, nigga
Just forget it, you talk it, I live it
Like Eli I did it, jokes on you muthafucker and I get it
No paper hoe, but you can have some more of me
Or-gy, or are we speakin methaphorically
Historically, I'm kickin' bitches out like Pam, nigga
Goin' HAM nigga, me and Jigga
and a nigga still young, wanna have no kids
But I've been practicing with some actresses as bad as shit
And a few white girls, asses flat a shit
But the head so good, damn a nigga glad he hit
Got em jumpin' out the building
Watch out below, a million out the door

I'm about to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am
I'm about to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am

[Jay-Z:]

You don't even know what I've been through
I play chicken with a Mack truck
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been moved
I swam waters with great whites
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been chewed
I hustle with vultures late nights
Y'all muthafuckers woulda been food
fuck wrong with these dudes
Try to walk around in these shoes
See the shit I saw growing up
And maybe you can take a peek at these boo's
niggas fantasize about the shit that I do daily like
These rappers rap about all the shit that I do really
I'm like really half a billi nigga
Really you got baby money
Keep it real with niggas
niggas ain't got my lady money
Watch the Throne don't step on our road
Bad enough we let you step on our globe
When my nephew died, daddy dead
niggas took the price on my uncles head
Nobody called the cops as my uncle bled
So I feel like I would like to know my uncles bread
Bow down, brother pay homage
don't spill hate all on my garments
Commes Des Garcon, fuck your fresh
head shots nigga fuck your vests
fuck the pig, no pork on my fork
Peace God cause you know a nigga just went Ham

Hard As a Muthafucker,
Let these niggas know who I am
Yeah I'm 'bout to go HAM
Hard As a Muthafucker,

Cause Iâm moving in slow motion, slow motion
Feelinâ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga, hey hey hey

So basically, Russell ainât the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero Zero Zero Zero, a whole lot of 0âs
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
Bullet proof condom when Iâm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick (why) fuckinâ centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on feelinâ like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Donât look at the jewelry, or get your blurr on
Too close, you comatose so dope you overdose
Get back, you overclose
Oh no, the hood was strugglinâ
But then I blessed them with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first soloâ¦

Yeah and Iâm cold bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
Take it how you want til a nigga dead
(Til then Iâm the illest motherfucker alive)
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
(Because Iâm the illest motherfucker alive)

[Jay-Z:]
Holla, King Hov, Iâm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings, Michael Jordan swag
Y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got a 5 more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now Iâm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch The Throne, yeah itâs like the Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih complete the family
Imagine how thatâs gon' look front row at the Grammy's
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphyâs couch
The Roc is in the building we should have stayed in the house
I donât even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas fashion is weak, they be wastinâ all the models
Got the over-sized Rolley let me show the how to do it
When I say it then you see, it ainât only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols serving as my muses
My house like a museum, so I see em when Iâm peeing
Usually you have this much taste you European
Thatâs the end of that way of thinking, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learned that
This is where DiNero would be if he ainât turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

[Kanye West:]
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause Iâm moving in slow motion slow motion
Feelinâ like Hype Williams shooting a nigga
Shooting a nigga hey hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now ay ay

Slow motion slow motion...

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said "you going to school I'll give you a summer"
Then she met NO ID and gave me his number
10 years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes â damn!
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it

I pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!
Built a republic, that still stands
I'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?
What's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty, chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner

[Jay-Z:]
Bloody murder, murder murder [x4]

[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, black on black murder
The paper read murder, black on black murder

[Jay-Z:]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing
All black everything, nigga you know my fresh code
Iâm out here fightinâ for you, donât increase my stress load
Niggas watchinâ the throne, very happy to be
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Kanye West:]
And Iâm from the murder capital, where they murder for capital
Heard about at least 3 killings this afternoon
Lookinâ at the news like damn I was just with him after school,
No shop class but half the school got a tool,
And I could die any day type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppinâ his avenue
Itâs time for us to stop and re-define black power
41 souls murdered in 50 hours

The paper read murder, black on black murder,
The paper read murder, black on black murder again
Murder againâ¦

Is it genocide?
Cause I can still hear his momma cry, know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face, bout piranha-size
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ainât got enough room for all the tombs
Itâs a war going on outside, we ainât safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq
509 died in Chicago

[Jay-Z:]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21 I was supposed to die
So Iâm out here celebratinâ my post demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to insure your survival
You gonâ end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up blood? What up cos?
Itâs all black, I love us

[Kanye West:]
The paper read murder, black on black murder,
The paper read murder, black on black murder again
Black on black murder again
Black on black murder again

[Jay-Z:]
Itâs a celebration of black excellence
Black tie, black Maybachs
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, Iâm present
I dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb
Do you know who I am Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I âshh-shhâ
Success never smelled so sweet, I stink of success
The new black elite, they say my black card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece, now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few blacks the higher I go
Whatâs up to Will, shoutout to O
That ainât enough, we gonâ need a million more
Kick in the door, Biggie flow
Iâm all dressed up with nowhere to go

[Kanye West:]
Yea itâs all messed up when itâs nowhere to go
So we wonât take the time out til we reach the T O P
From paroles to hold Gâs, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OGâs
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
Whatâs the last thing you expect to see, black guys
Whatâs the life expectancy for black guys?
The systemâs working effectively, thatâs why
Iâll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
Cause ainât nothinâ on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ainât nothinâ new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So letâs savor this moment, and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours


[Kanye West:]
Yeah, uh
(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
Me and the RZA connect
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
Yeah, me and the RZA connect
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(For me, for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

And Iâll never let my son have an ego
Heâll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean, I might even make âem be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And Iâll never let âem leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwind
And Iâll never let âem ever hit the telethon
I mean even if people dyinâ and the world ends
See, I just want âim to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want âim to be someone people like
Donât want âim to be hated, all the time judged
Donât be like your daddy that would never budge
And Iâll never let âim ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ainât the place to get love
And Iâll never let his mom move to L.A.
Knowinâ she couldnât take the pressure, now we all pray

(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Itâs a new life for me)
Me and the RZA connect
(For me, for me)
Me and the RZA connect (Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

[Jay-Z:]
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya
âCause you ainât even alive, paparazzi pursuinâ ya
Sins of a father make yoâ life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondinâ on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it
Took me 26 years to find my path
My only job is cuttinâ the time in half
So at 13 weâll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakinâ
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

(Sun in the sky)
(You know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)
(Breeze driftinâ on by)

(Itâs a new life for me)
(For me, for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinâ good)

(Sun in the sky, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by, you know how I feel)
(Breeze driftinâ on by, you know how I feel)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(Itâs a new dawn, itâs a new day)
(Itâs a new life for me)
(Oooh, oooh)
(And Iâm feelinââ¦)
(Birds flyinâ high, you know how I feel)


[Chazz Michael Michaels:] We're gonna skate to one song and one song only.

Ball so hard, since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too,
I'm supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin' Ace on my sick J's
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets to BK

[2x]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray [3x]

[Kanye West:]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray (that shit cray), ain't it Jay?
Ball so hard
What she order (what she order), fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold (whip so cold), this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you'll never be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France (I'm just sayin')
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
'Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louis my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest
'Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

[(Chazz Michael Michaels) Jimmy MacElroy:]
I don't even know what that means.
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not, it's gross
(It gets the people going!)

[Jay-Z:]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

[Kanye West:]

Actin' like the summer ain't mine

[Jay-Z:]

[Kanye West:]

How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone [2x]

[Jay-Z and Kanye West:]
I'm definitely in my zone


[Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild

[Jay-Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the coliseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rollinâ in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, Iâm hidinâ from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
Iâm wonderinâ if a thugâs prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asks, âWhose bias do yâall seek?â
All for Plato, screech
Iâm out here ballinâ, I know yâall hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

We make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild

[The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption

[Kanye West:]
Coke on her black skin made a stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as thereâs permissionâ
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody witâout tellinâ me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun cominâ up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinkinâ âbout the girl in all-leopard
Who was rubbinâ the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read âNo Apologiesâ
The other said âLove is cursed by monogamyâ
Thatâs somethinâ that the pastor donât preach
Thatâs somethinâ that a teacher canât teach
When we die, the money we canât keep
But we probably spend it all âcause the pain ainât cheap
Preach

[Frank Ocean:]
Human beings in a mob
Whatâs a mob to a king?
Whatâs a king to a god?
Whatâs a god to a non-believer?
Who donât believe in anything?

Will he make it out alive
All right, all right
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild
No church in the wild


[Otis Redding]
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah
You won't regret it, no no
No, girls they don't forget it
LOVE is their home, happiness, yeah
Squee... squee... squee... squeeze her
Don't tease her, never leave her

[Jay-Z]
Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?
OWW! Uhh

I invented swag
Poppin bottles, puttin supermodels in the cab
Proof...
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublot's
Or the big face Roley, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes; go

[Kanye West]
"Damn Yeezy and Hov', where the hell you been?"
Niggaz talkin real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggaz, Phillip Drummond 'em
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't see me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, photo shoot fresh, lookin like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way I might murk ya
Flee in the G-450 I might surface
Political refugee asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never goin to jail

[Kanye West]
I made "Jesus Walks" I'm never goin to hell
Couture level flow, it's never goin on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't 'custommed to goin through customs, you ain't been nowhere, huh?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showin off
I'm done, I'll hit you up maÃ±a-naaaaaaaaaa!

[Jay-Z]
Welcome to Havana
Smokin Cubanas with Castro in cabanas
Viva MÃ©xico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Drivin Benzes, with no benefits
Not bad, huh? For some immigrants
Build your fences, we diggin tunnels
Can't you see we gettin money up under you?

[Kanye West (Jay-Z)]
Can't you see the private jets flyin over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chillin (uhh) 'Ye is chillin (uhh)
What more can I say? (What more can I say?) We killin 'em
Hold up, before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lanes
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

[Otis Redding]
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Scream it! [3X]


[Jay-Z:]
We in the time of our lives baby
Turn the music up, primetime

Yeah, primetime, beat by Dion, our third eon
Thatâs what the fuck we on
Moâ money, 40 year old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42 be better than 24, I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23âs they canât fuck with the boy
As far as them 16âs, Iâm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that 6 deuce
That 9-11 I only subtract the roof
Started in 88â, got warm in 92â, I landed in 96â
Thatâs the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puffâs stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
Iâm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it 2, nigga we rolling, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do (ooh)

[Kanye West:]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
Cause they donât want nobody thatâs colored out of the lines
So Iâm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Niggas gonâ kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, Iâm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean itâs like, itâs like our first 1st class flight
Iâm trippinâ on it, socks on marble floors
Iâm slippinâ on it, champagne, Iâm sippinâ on it
Shit taste different, donât it?
You know what, you right
Itâs like the best damn champagne I had in my life
âWhen you coming homeâ Thatâs a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker til I call you back
I mean who says shit like that, and doesnât laugh (un-huh)

The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh
The night is young, what the fuck we gonâ do, huh
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh


[Kanye West:]
Hello, can I speak to a, a, yeah you know who you are

Something on some of this realest shit
Something, something
Yeah. thats my bitch

Thats my bitch
Sh-shorty right there

[Chorus - Elly Jackson:]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

[Kanye West:]
I paid for them titties, get your own
It aint safe in the city, watch the throne
You say I care more about them basquion's, basquiats
She learning a new word, its yacht
Blew the World up as soon as I hit the club with her
Too Short called, told me "I fell in love with her"
Seen by actors, ball players and drug dealers
And some lesbians that never loved niggas
Twisted love story True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance
I'm a freak huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, thats our wife
Hey boys and girls, I got a new riddle
Who's the new old perv thats tryna play second fiddle
No disrespect, I'm not tryna belittle
But my dick worth money I put Monie in the middle

[Chorus - Elly Jackson:]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high, high, high, high

Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning
Not swerving, oh, yeah
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Jay-Z:]
Go harder than a nigga for a nigga go figure
Told me "keep my own money" if we ever did split up
How can somethin' so gangsta be so pretty in pictures?
With jeans and a blazer and some Louboutin slippers
Uh, Picasso was alive he woulda made her
Thats right nigga Mona Lisa can't fade her
I mean Marilyn Monroe, she's quite nice
But why all the pretty icons always all white
Back to my Beyonces
You deserve 3 stacks for the Andre
Call Larry Gagosian, you belong in museums
You belong in Vintage clothes watching the whole building
You belong with niggas who used to be known for dope dealing
You too dope for any of those civilians
Now shoot trigga, stop looking at her tits
Get ya own dog, ya heard
Thats my bitch

[Chorus:]
I've been waiting for a long long time
Just to get off and throw my hands up high
And live my life
And live my life
Just to get off and throw my hands up high

Silly little vixen, mixes 'til morning
Not swerving, oh, yeah
Swear you never strolled on a bottle of that potion
Stop motion, ooh, yeah

[Kanye West:]
You have no idea what you're dealing with
Something on some of this realest shit
Pop some nines, so I give you the Fifth
Something, something, yeah

That's my bitch, That's my bitch
Sh-shorty right there? That's my bitch
That's my bitch


[Hook - Curtis Mayfield:]
Add a little sugar, honeysuckle lamb
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are all the makings of you

[Verse 1 - Kanye West:]
I do it for the forefathers and the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off of
Gave her a handshake only for my manâs sake
She in her birthday suit cause of the damn cake
Now thereâs crumbs all over the damn place
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood planned parenthood
Cause I never met nobody plan to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that wonât make it to the family will
If I donât make it, canât take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they donât know how insanity feel
Don C just had a shorty, so itâs not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Kanye West:]
No electro, no metro, a little retro, ahh, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezyâs back in style
Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
Whatâs more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they black, they "sisters"
They momma named them after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelryâs Egyptian, know the hungerâs Ethiopian
Stupid questions like âIs he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? has anybody spoke to him?â
This beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch
And a bag of weed; the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your lifeâs cursed, well mineâs an obscenity

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jay-Z:]
This is my momma shit; I used to hear this
Through the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit
Afros and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja had it
Popping like the sample that Iâm rhyming with
Pete Rock, let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid they surprised I donât needle pop
Taking sips of pop, six pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale
Ballyâs on my feet help me balance out well
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my mommaâs
Virgin Marys try to judge her
Iâm like âWhere the Madonnas now?â
Give all glory to Gloria
They said âyou raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warriorâ
We victorious, theyâll never take the joy from us, uh

[Outro - Kid Cudi (w/ Pete Rock):]
Keep your hands up, get mine up
Donât let them take your fire
Yeah, okay
(Itâs Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay)


[Swizz:]
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle well
[x2]

[Kanye West:]
I asked her where she wanna be when she 25.
She turned around and looked at me and she said "alive"

[Swizz:]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well

[Jay-Z:]
Black Axl Rose, move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears
Work pots and pans, just to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard

[Kanye West:]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que sera, get a case of Ciroc
Let it chase the pain, before it goes too far

[Jay-Z:]
My dreams is big, reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon,
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending
Where the fuck is the sun?
It's been a while, momma, look at ya son
What happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
God damn I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Press?
Either they know or don't care I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Risking my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it well

[Swizz:]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
Goddammit!


[Kanye West:]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die Iâma fuckinâ ball
Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?

[Jay-Z:]
Black cards, black cars,
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for?

[Kanye West:]
Who gonâ stop me huh?

[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
Who gonâ stop me, huh?

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah, who gonâ stop me?
No brakes, I need, State Farm
So many watches I need 8 arms
One neck but got 8 charms

[Jay-Z & Kanye West:]
Who gonâ stop me, huh?

[Kanye West:]
Niggas talkinâ, they bitch made, Ix-nay off my dicks-nay
Thatâs pig Latin, itch-bay
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Last night ainât go so well
Got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert
Yes! Tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator, if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say none
Heard she fucked the doorman
Well thatâs cool I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess thatâs on one basis
I only like green faces

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
Til I die Iâma fuckinâ ball

Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?

[Jay-Z:]
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for

[Kanye West:]
Yâall weed purple, my money purple
Yâall Steve Urkel, Iâm Oprah circle
I wrote the verse, that I hope will hurt you

[Jay-Z:]
Who gone stop me huh?
Beat the odds, best the Feds
It wouldnât be wise, to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, 6 to 6
Gimmie one shot, one pot
Iâll show up in all white, wearing no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know Iâm a dope boy
They donât have no proof
Iâm 3 steps removed, I know how to move
Itâs looking like, I donât know how to lose
Iâm winning again, Iâm at the Wynn
Iâm at the table, Iâm gambling,
Lucky lefty, I expect a 7,
I went through hell, Iâm expecting heaven, Iâm owed,
Iâm throwed and I stuck to the G-code,
Iâm here, oh yeah, I promise I ainât going nowhere,
OK here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
Iâm allergic to having bunny ears,
Like broke, like nope, like ha,
I ainât no joke, I canât be stopped
Like nope, like nope
To the beat Noahâ¦

2 seats in the 911, no limit on the black card
Told yâall I was gonna go HAM, told the ocean was my backyard
No lies in my verses, please pardon all the curses
Shit gotta come some way, fuck, when you growing up worthless
Middle finger to my old life, special shout out to my old head
If it wasnât for your advice, a nigga would have been so dead
Iâm living life, til these niggas kill me
Turn this up, if these niggas feel me
Iâm riding dirty, trying to get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MOMA
And I did all of this, without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Yâall can play me for a motherfuckinâ fool if you wanna,
Street smart, and Iâm book smart
Could have been a chemist, cause I cook smart
Only thing to stop me is me,
And Iâma stop when the hook start
Hold up

[Kanye West:]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the lord
Til I die, Iâma fuckinâ ball

Now who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?
Who gonâ stop me?
Who gonâ stop me huh?

[Jay-Z:]
Black cards, black cars
Black on black, black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what thatâs for


[Chorus â Mr Hudson:]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you
Iâll never know
[x4]

[Jay-Z:]
Picture if you will, that the throne was burning
Rome was burning, and Iâm sitting in the corner all alone burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we donât determine
Same people that I fought for
That I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead
But Iâm so sorry but I just canât die for you
But I can make em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over, Iâll be fly when Easterâs over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So the love is gone, til blood is drawn
So we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

[Chorus â Mr Hudson:]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you
Iâll never know
[x4]

[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces, before you swept on it
God damn this shit leaves a mess donât it
Shit feelinâ like death donât it
Charge it to the game, whateverâs left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasnât I a good king?
(Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?)
Didnât I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
(Huh, I gave you my loyalty)
Made you royalty and royalties
(Took care of these niggas lawyer fees)
And this is how niggas rewardinâ me
(Damn)

[Chorus â Mr Hudson:]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you
Iâll never know
[x2]

[Jay-Z (Kanye West):]
Bussinâ at me, b-b-b-bussinâ at me
But Iâm bullet proof, bitch you canât get nothinâ past me
Got body armor (A nigga gotta watch the throne)
And Iâm bussinâ back, so niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turns to hate?
(Gotta separate from these fuckinâ fakes)
Caesar didnât see it so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brotherâs keeper?
(Only if that nigga donât creep up)
Got a pistol under my pillow
(Iâve never been a deep sleeper)
P-p-p-paranoia
(Cause the nigga that said heâllâ¦)
Blast for ya (Is nowâ¦)
Blastinâ for ya, thatâs an assassin for ya
(These niggas got a shot theyâll shoot)
Please Lord (Forgive him)
For these niggas (Not know) What they, (Do) (Ooh)
