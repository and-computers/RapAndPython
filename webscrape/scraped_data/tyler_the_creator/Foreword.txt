[Tyler, The Creator:]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run out of drive?
How much drive can I have 'til I run out of road?
How much road can they pave 'til they run out of land?
How much land can there be until I run in the ocean?
You niggas go with the motions and all the plans
Sea I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
Falling outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until I turn on the AC?
If the AC blows, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

[Rex Orange County:]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Shout out to the girls that I lead on
For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
And trying their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be 'til them Black lives matter?
Niggas click clack splatter, pew, pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in

[Rex Orange County:]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
