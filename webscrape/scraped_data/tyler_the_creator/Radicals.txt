[Intro]
Random disclaimer
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay? It's fuckin' fiction
If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me, white America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
4, 3, 2, 1

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like sayin' I'm sorry
To a bunch of fuckin' fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fuckin' Wolves that'll guard me
They skate hard brash black hoodies, try somethin'
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tie 'em up in a shoestring
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Hook]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
Left, right, left, right

[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fuckin' rock star
Rebel and defiance makes my muthafuckin' cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, they all so fuckin' retard
Fuck school, I'mma fuck up, fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fuckin' money, hey mom
I ain't got no muthafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come that faggot still ain't bought me anything
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
See they're not mine so you gotta let 'em go
We can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know
