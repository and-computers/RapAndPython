[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink and in the blink
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with a link, intended her to meet me
At the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skatin' rink
We be uniquely in sync, already fuckin' and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was workin' for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
Well, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
It reeks of a street girl, streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which makes meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up,thoughts plot and rethink
Now I get daughters and time in the clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up, too fit, my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

[Verse 2]
Bitches runnin' round down pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips poppin' on that cannon, bustin' odd mind cannons
On the pill, is he real? Gaza strippin'
In my livin' room, Wolf Gang full moon
I'm assumin' mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is endin' soon, because I'm ejaculatin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank the Mother Earth
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters, hell hide grandmama too
Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool, he on the loose, yeah

[Outro]
Gotta wash you down, all this gold is fuckin' bathing
Wait 'til you see semenâs swimming, baby please not pass on all these great wolves
Your body's near the coral reef, once upon a time came home with me
Then the next chapter left her upon my teeth
Fill your gills with goo, going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke
Gotta wear a wetsuit, canât get seasick
I love when you wear fishnets, you want me to eat you
Youâre fucking wet, fish
