[Tyler, The Creator:]
I might just add a verse for no reason, fuck it
Ayo

I shit in my garden and play Stevie Wonder
And get foot massages while Clancy talk numbers
He threw me some game and I swear I won't fumble
Might cop me a Bronco to ride for the summer
Marni the trousers, tell Risso to holla
The carnival sell out, the stadium Dodger
I cut off some homies, but Taco my brodie
Until he score millions, I won't leave the goalie
Might pass 'em the mittens, he never betrayed me
The E30 sitting, the 675LT my daily
The engine is stupid, I drive like a tutor
When I move, it moves, the transmission like Luda
Now ketchup like packets, my new nigga pretty
Your new bitch is tacky like Busta Rhymes jackets
Want smoke? I can match it, the second-hand action
We exhale you inhale and asthma attack
Teeing off, niggas nauseous
As fuck, fuck you thought?
Bitch, it's GOLF

[Lil Baby:]
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"

[Tyler, The Creator:]
This shit going crazy, I swear I go crazy
I never met him but man shout out Lil Baby
We running the thing [*gibberish*] I just ran out of words
