
I don't wanna play you, I just wanna tape you undress
And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror
Pop the pop corn, the thought to rape you really turns me on

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,

You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die hard fan, can't stop with the tapings
Sorta like a psycho when I can't stop with the raping
Of the VHS especially during sex baby

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,

Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slowmo, I don't wanna bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
You're dream movie, I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,
STOP!

Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let me try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We can kick it on the couch, blunt to you, roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really wanna feel the room
I just wanna kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We can count the stars on the hood in your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take it him day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a just kiss?

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We both teenagers with the same mind state
How 'bout some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waitin' for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um
