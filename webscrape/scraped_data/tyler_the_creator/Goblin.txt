
You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone
You don't even have the balls to begin with
What you need is me, someone to talk to
Uh, it's been a while since our last session
So, tell me what's been going on

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm supposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
LA to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in the air, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pockets, so now I could go buy
A couple hot pockets and grandmom could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressures on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

Made a couple thou and I just don't know what to buy yet

The Preme shit is free, and I don't drink so fuck a wine set
Nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research
I'm the star of the group
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good tho.) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor

People excited thinking shit is so tight (for what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic
And start jacksing him off until his cack blasting off?
Fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the immortal of tech of the nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead that real hip hop
That's bull of the sheet but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (they dont, its not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

Therapist been sinnin' and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me, cause I do not fuck with religion
You see that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear
Someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed his AK-47 at 47 kids
I don't wanna see my name mentioned

College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
For the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since 8
I can afford to get something my mother on her birthday

They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians

I, still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
Then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (no you dont)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee
