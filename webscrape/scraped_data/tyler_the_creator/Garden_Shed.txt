[Estelle:]
Don't kill the rose
Boy, it could move
Love every flower
Out the cocoon

[Tyler, The Creator:]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah

[Estelle & Tyler, The Creator:]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go

[Estelle:]
Don't kill the rose
Boy, it could move
Love every flower
Out the cocoon

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garÃ§ons
Them feelings I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the base 10
Polka dot knows, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies when I float
I was always like eh
Barely interested, but I bag just to brag to my boys like bruh
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder
Tryna grab the rings of Saturn
I'm a plant it by the time you hear this
Chittin' chatter, 'bout to heat it
It will not fuckin' matter
