When you're having fun, fun
Time flies, time flies, time flies
When you're having fun (time flies)
Out the window (go, go, go)

Boredom got a new best friend
(Boredom, boredom, best friend)
Cause boredom got a new best friend
Boredom got a new best friend
Na na na...

Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
(Find some time, oh)

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to dry wall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
Cause I havenât seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
And sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

[Rex Orange County, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator:]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something

[Tyler, The Creator & Anna of the North:]
Cause boredom got a new best friend
Boredom got a new best friend
Cause boredom got a new best friend

[Rex Orange County:]
Find some time, find some time
Gotta find some time, find some time
Gonna find some, find some time
...
Time, time, time, time...
