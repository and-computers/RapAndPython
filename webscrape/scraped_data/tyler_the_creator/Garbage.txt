[Verse 1:]
Hello I'm a salesman sorta giant 
I sell Molly and Mary 
And other various items 
One time one guy came to where I'm residing 
And I didn't invite him, so instead tryin' fight him 
I got violent, long story short he's not breathin'
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting 
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is 
A couple junkies went missing 
And I know right where they're hiding 

Uhh

[Chorus]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

Do-Dope in my bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna die 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

(Two Jobs) 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

[Verse 2:]
Task force poured into my fortress 
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses 
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm 
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms 
They found a couple portraits on the porch
But they don't check up under the floor 
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shotty 
Hit so many bitches I was pimpin like Scotty 
I'm a bull 
Red
Piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me  
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft 
I'm a wolf and a designer mixing skin, cotton, leather and wool 
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods 
Baking cake cause it's good, I mean I would if I could 
But I like playing dress up and mix match 
Sorry imma fess up, you aren't getting your kids back

[Chorus]
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

Do-Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on my side 
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high 

[Verse 3:]
What's in my trunk
White 
Girl

What's in my trunk 
White 
Girl 

You need a warrant, officer 

You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't 
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face 
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood 
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven 

Yeah
