
We come through throbbin' like thunder storms
Make them feets get wet and funky up in they under arms
I'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwin' bombs
With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on
Niggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms
Suck a dick, eat salam gettin' they nails done in salons
Hodgy Beats is like limp balm
If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms
Haters must be starvin' nowadays I make California Vietnam
And I'm goin' to embalm my creativity
Into a CD-rom, so you can feel this shit up on

Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, yeah
Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, oh my God
Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?
Could you bring the keys? Yeah
Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?
Drop the drums

=Pink chinchilla, cause I'm like Thrilla
My t-shirts are bathin', a bathin' gorilla
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda
But I ate that whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eatin' donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Makin' shit come like I'm go-go gadget
I'm mental, it's instrumental
Make your future therapist ask for dental records
And I hope this record have you stabbin' niggas with colored pencils

Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, yeah
Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, oh my God
Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?
Could you bring the keys? Yeah
Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?
Drop the drums

Yo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces
You're feelin' life, I'll mug your teachers
I've got Muslims crawlin' on Jesus
I fucked Kelly, where is Regis?
Found Alicia, now she keyless
Cold as ice, and now I'm creamless
Murdered every bod from my squad
So technically, now I'm teamless, O.F. is so prestigious
