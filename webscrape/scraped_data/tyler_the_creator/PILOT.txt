
Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when?
On a scale from nine to ten
You taking L's baby, 
Hold my hand and feel the wind, uh
Now fasten your seatbelt and turn everything off
I got your attention, muthafucka I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
Brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga you ain't high enough to save me
Don't talk to me til I fuckin' embarrass you
Now sit your ass down you do it three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

I'm so far ahead you niggas I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you
You niggas know what I'm sayin'
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess
I'm the fuckin' bomb like I would stuff my shoe in it
If anything happens it's one door
If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for
I'mma hit a couple of 'em up cause it's Parkour
Then I call your family and get your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless

I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash

I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach

I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be
With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at
You could buy a car, you could buy many things
You could buy happiness but you can't buy wings
You could buy a parachute, you could buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings that will dynamic
Stay cloud level

That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach

I don't wanna
