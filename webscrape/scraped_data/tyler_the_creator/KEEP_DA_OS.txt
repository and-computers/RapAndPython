[Hook:]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's
Know they know me by treat your nose

[Verse 1 - Pharrell Williams:]
Look, UFO, bow, land
Skrr landed on the ass and
Adidas leaf in the grassland
My finger got a yellow Pac-Man
Blow your purple
Go in circles
(So inertia)
Go reverse it
No rehearsin'
Gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion
Golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving
Yeah you heard me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Tyler, The Creator:]
My garden's full from breaking these hoes
A hand full of green and a couple of stones
Your lawnmower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments
Fuck your compliments, bitch I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck
I do not have to adjust
You stuck, I'm talking
So shut the fuck up
Speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You convene with that circle of demons youâre hoping them niggasâll see it
Results may vary
Chains got too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than crash in that Bugatti
Back to the garden
Niggas gon' do dirty
Y'all already saw it
Killing your flowers
This thingâs impossible
It's the new slave apocalypse
Isnât that obvious
All you stupid niggas got the whips

[Hook]

Keep da o's
You gotta keep the o's
Cause you never know when it's over
You want the doors that go up
You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time

Find your wings
Find your wings
Find your wings
And fly
You'll find your wings
(You'll find your wings)
Learn how to fly
(Learn how to fly)

What I want you to do
(What I want you to do)

You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly
(Learn)

I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now
What the fuck has gotten into me, man
