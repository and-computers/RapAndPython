
Now when I first saw you
I could tell you was the one
That I've been searchin' for
I needed somethin' that was like the Sun
Now all my flowers grow
Right now my life, it blooms, baby

You're my favorite color, my favorite color
My favorite color's you
It's like the endless summer, endless summer
Whenever I'm with you
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
