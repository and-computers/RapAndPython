[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than tigger,
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger, (Uhh),
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block,
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em, (Uhh),
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill And let's pretend like,
I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers, (Uhm),
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck,
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor, (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs, I'm her mister, sipping slurpees, bag of chips,
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture, (Uhh),
OF is popping like a blister, need some listerine,
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister, (Uhh),
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out of ten flasks,
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner, and hopefully I get her,
If I don't, Fuck it then, see I never simp son, pull the opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

[Hook: Casey Veggies & Tyler, the Creator]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
The moon not working and the stars align,
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...)
I had a decline in the buzz, not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum,
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge,
And ask why bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum,
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem,
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem,
Eaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon(y),
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I'm like goals, those is something you have to stand to reach,
My campaign speech elect me, Commander in Chief,
Respect to me is ever minor, appearances cause mass hysteria,
But I'm still uncomparable, I'm like the face of America,
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold,
I'm a fuckin' centerfold, I'm somethin' to behold,
I can kill a hundred shows, take on for the road,
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh,
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup,
(I thought that you were nice)
Yeah I am slut,
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas, Yep I'm a mixed mutt
Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case,
Golf is the bedsheets, (Hat and my T-shirt),
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Ferguson,
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen,
It's Bimmer Boy's boy never swerving in the Benz,
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten,
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?

It's Loiter Squad nigga...
Fucking Loiter Squad...

Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem are hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me?
Slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him first
