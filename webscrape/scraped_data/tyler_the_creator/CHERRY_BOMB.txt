I don't even know how to perform it

Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out his flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a god, no, I don't pray to society
All you other niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
What weak niggas see me?
Nigga, Young creators will scream with me
Nigga, you ain't got drivers to just beep-beep .
They wanna talk shit from the back seat
Come and light,my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Float in the air
It's cherry bomb

You muthafuckas want war, then come get it
You muthafuckas want war, I don't want war
(Muthafuckas!)Just take me to the gun store
I don't got enough time for your rolex nigga
I choke your dad, hit your mom, cuz I don't know that nigga
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga, I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Strangled in the air
It's cherry bomb

You muthafuckas want war?!
Fuck that like "this that cherry bomb"
They're like "this that cherry bomb"

I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
