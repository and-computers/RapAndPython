Fuck, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
Cause I think youâre a fucking fag

[TC]

You've been practicing

[Sam]

Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while
Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright?
Now you guys have fun

[Wolf]
So you guys are into jazz?

[Sam]
Look, Wolf, Prairie Dog, Dontelle

You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours
Capisce?
