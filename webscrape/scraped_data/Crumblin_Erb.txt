[Verse One: Andre]
Yessuh
Let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Property got me selling things, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be thrown up
But still Andre got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine, thinking that you
Gots ample to do this have you shot I thought you knew this
I'm crumblin', no time for fumbling selling my sacks, watching my back
Wettin 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash of blood,
the clock is ticking, niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got, only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming broke but I be saying they pro-cras-ti-natin
Settlin for less, bet be ready
When they roll up in your nest and, sink one in your chest and
You're gone, up outta here for good
Y'all be bobbing back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, what's up?

[Chorus:]
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (what's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb

[Verse Two: Big Boi]
So check me out, see
Once in a while when niggas be trying to test me I get frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey then they swing but shit they missed me huh
I'm getting nice with them things, because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and yes my man I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice like it's the brick the way that wall done flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-four Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters count 'em nigga fucking high
See I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes and drive-by's
Kiss your ass bye-bye, sayanora suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be bopping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm Huntin Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Big Boi, Andre]
Wooo! Big Boi
Got a tampa nugget, blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping, it's simply marvelous time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mon be smocking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit, to take another hit so hit it
Of the cannabis seteva weed reefer yeah smoke shit
It's all day any 'til they label me deceased
So fire up another one and smoke out and fuck the world peace

We, is gonna smoke out, until we choke out
Like some merry men, cowards I be burying
Coming around my shop with that see nigga you get nothing
Just like DJ do the cutting I be having your posse ducking nothing but
King Shit, I am asking, sucker can you hand
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
Sprinkle sprinkle motherfucker don't be crying on me
That stuff the sess be in my chest until I'm chilling in peace, yeah

[Chorus]

[Outro: Big Boi]
Ah shit now
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Dropping these things like French fries in hot grease
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I, just to let y'all niggas know
Forever pimping never slipping that's how it is
That how it's gon' be, that's how it was in the past
That's how it's gon' be in the futures nigga
It's all day everyday, so what you wanna do with it?
Bring that shit on, know what I'm saying? Yeah

[Chorus 2.5X]
