[Big Boi:]
Hootie Hoo 
Follow the funk from the skunk and the dank that is crunk in the dungeon 
It goes on and on and on, like that 
Goin out to the Jeeps and hoes in the 'Lac 
Ah suki, suki 
All day and day, any day, every damn day 
I be thinkin about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper 
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after 
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp 
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm servin hemp 
I never even smoke that crumba crap but yo, I'm dope 
But doper than a junky or a pooky cuz it's on 
So each one, teach one, I be claimin true 
Two weeks born in College Park and the things I used to do 
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers 
Club niggaz, Magic City and them Southern playas 
I never said I was a gangsta but I will do ya 
So Hallelujah, Hallelujah 
One for the playas at the crib, dank and dranks 
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make 

[chorus:]
Hootie Hoo 
Tight like always, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo) 
Yeah, Hootie Hoo 
Big Boi on the left, Andre's on my right 
Tight like always, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo) 

[Dre:]
Now playin these bitches is my favorite sport 
But ain't no game when they be callin your name in the court 
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright 
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight 
That it's bustin out the seems, yes sir, I'm set 
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet 
Hops off in the Lac with Big Gipp, you got a light (Hootie Hoo) 
Communication device off when I writes 
Should I answer the call, yes, I'm mackin 'em all 
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball 
Well, it's Player's Ball 2, so I guess I'll call you 
Later on, and then your whole crew can fall through 
Now later on done got here 
I takes a peek, now let me see, what do we got here? 
Draws, fallin down like niggaz in a drive-by 
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye 
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit 
Talkin 'bout her period late, guess what I did 
Click 
Naw, it couldn't be me. Not me 

[chorus (2X)]

[Big Boi:]
Uh, well you know we gettin blizzard cuz we got that chicken gizzard 
In the dungeon and scope but some of you niggaz can't cope with it 
So, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop 
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park 
So got on Martino, it's Outkast for the 94 era 
You heard the player's call, we takin it to another level 
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel 
And you may go to hell 

[Dre:]
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is 
It's that Southern ses in your chest that is 
One mo' gen for my friend who don't take 
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank 
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will make you 
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you 
Down like some bo-los, you can throw those 
Head, til I'm dead, yes, it's now your broke hoes 
Don't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit 
But if you fall in this category, then youse a bitch 

[chorus (4X)]
