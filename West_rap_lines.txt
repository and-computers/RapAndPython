Death Row, that's where mothafuckas is endin' up

Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch?
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn, they got me trapped
Hawkin' while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
'Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger-happy to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
Whip out the 9, now [?] pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites
I listened to his screams, until he went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers
And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, 'cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt when you're black
And you're trapped in a living hell
I shouldn't have let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I could've died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm
You can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal, can't sleep
Instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama, pray for me; tell the Lord to make way for me
Prepare any day for me (Why?)
'Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter 'cause I'm dying, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book
That mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers, and in all these years
They ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
'Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I would've known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

16 on Death Row, Death Row
Death Row, Death Row
16 on Death Row, Death Row, Death Row
It's to all my partners
In the penitentiaries; 16 on Death Row


Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
O.P.D. -- what??!
(Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse)
(When this album come out, niggas can kiss my ass)
Did you think I'd fall?
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
(Introducing you to my criminal crew)
(Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential)
(Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground Railroad, Digital Underground gets around and we down in this bitch)
(You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker)
Cause I'm gettin' paid
And the more you try to keep niggas away from me
The more I unite with mo' niggas and mo' niggas and mo' niggas
(Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major)
And there's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
(I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of our fathers)

"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
My definition of a thug nigga
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"

I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin' down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin'
But I'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause I'm strugglin'
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
Break a ho when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass cops
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga

"Tis the season... to be servin'"

Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggas
They're quick to pull a nine when it's time do niggas
Comin' through like I'm two niggas, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin' for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin' back
Daydreamin' with the nine in my lap (huh)
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin' trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga

[Samples:]
"Tis the season, to be servin'"

"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"

Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggas don't like me cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, cause I'm all in
And any nigga tryin' to take what I got'll
hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggas
I'm just tryin to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right
I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve em all

(Warren G fuckin' with that one nigga)


[2pac:]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

[2pac:]
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

[Eric Williams:]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

[2pac:]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

[Eric Williams:]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

[2pac:]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

[Eric Williams:]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love

My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed

A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
Hustle
(And doubled every fuckin' yard that I cop and stop)
(Hell nah! I couldn't see it)
(Facin' a century in the Penitentiary but so be it)
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate)
(But wait)
No time for stallin'
(But death is callin')
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start fallin'
(True, what I do from sun up)

Money gone fuck friends, I need a homie that know me
When all these motherfuckin' cops be on me
I got problems, ain't nobody callin' back
Now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats?
Remember me? I'm your homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy, hangin' with the clowns, and all
We used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens, we fuckin' cousins
You can throw your middle finger if you feel me, loc
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time, but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around, and all I see is snakes and fakes
It's like scavengers, waitin' to take a hustler's place
And when you stuck, where the fuck is all your friends?
They straight busted and can't be trusted; fuck y'all!

'Cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscin' on how close we was
Way back in the day, before they put the crack in the way
And hey, how much money can you stack in a day?
It's gettin' rough, collect calls from my niggas in cuffs
I recollect we used to ball, now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter, summer, spring or fall
"Thug For Life" sprawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album, sell a million, give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark, these marks
Keep on huffin' and puffin', ain't no fear in my heart
What's goin' on in the ghetto? Still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater, smokin' chocolate Thai
In '94, I'll be goin' solo
Too many problems of my own so I'm rollin' dolo; fuck all y'all!

Huh, pardon me!

I went from rags to riches
Quick to socializin' with the baddest bitches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' "Gloriaaaa," doin' 90 'cause I wanna
I'm gettin' high, and like I said, it was some chocolate thai
Mixed with some Indonesia, watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and I continue doin' 90
Until I get caught, another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law, give a shit, I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried, still throwin' these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey, nigga, what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout?
Soon as I hit the cell, I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets, I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screamin' "Thug Life!", nigga, fuck y'all!

Fuck all the hard copies daily news
Fuck the bitches, the tele news, New York Posts, all those motherfuckers

Major! Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellraiser

Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexin'
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'mma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser
Stress gettin' major, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya feel me

Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellraiser, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'
Mama raised a hellraiser, uh, yeah
C'mon, uh, mama raised a hellraiser
Uh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high till they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
it's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker, I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
with my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die


Hold on... [*lighter flicks up*]
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
Don't trip, baby [*inhales*]
It'll get better... [*coughing*]
Aye, do this thug style, man, thug style
When this whole beat drop
We just gon' run it to 'em
Bet, it's all good, uh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had pain in my heart
I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain, but I'm still here
Never did like the police
Let the whole world know, now I gets no peace
'Cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a thug goes through
And still I rise, so keep your head up
And make your mind strong
It's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on

Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on

There's never a good day, 'cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' before they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz?
Remember how it was?
The picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin', gettin' high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky
And be strong, most of all, hold on

Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on

(Hold on, be strong [*repeats in background*])
I know them ain't tears comin' down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world, only the strong survive, you know?
Hehe, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, car-jackings
Yeah, we got problems
But believe me when I tell you things always get better
God don't like ugly, and God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said?
Bay-bee, God bless the child that can hold his own
You know? You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell 'em "Hold on!", and be strong
The game don't stop, huh
This here is black, man
If you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, 'til the casket drop
Thug for life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad
Especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic


I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, 'cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella?
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
'Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, "When will the violence cease?"
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, on our own business
Fuck the guard, 'cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them 'cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(yeah), I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(soldier in eye's)
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I see you - I see you boy

I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggas laughed, 'til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin' out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
Holla "five-o" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the Pen', I'm hittin' fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin' one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggas die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G

Watch out of all this, nigga

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
I'm gettin' high, think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
as I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G

I'm gettin' money (money)
I'm gettin' money (money)

I'm gettin' money (money)

Yeah nigga, get paid

RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin' the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G

I'm gettin' money (money)

Pass the shit
Gettin' paid (gettin' paid)


Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go

[2Pac:]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffocate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it

Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[4x]

[Big Syke:]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentality
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it

Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[4x]

[Spice 1:]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to [?]
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

[Fading:]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind

Now they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight
You's a baller lyin' to them youngstas quick
Got them thinkin' you sick and representin' yo click

Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennessy, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snupe, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
Ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Havin' house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
Straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
And it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool, now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushin' and I'm rushin' to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lyin'
Why? I seen her talkin' to this other guy and
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin', I just hope he get 'em, I got nuttin but love

[Dave (2Pac):]
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours)

I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
And pay respect to the place that I came from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love

[Dave (2Pac):]
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(I'm down for yours)

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
And the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
Started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
'Til the dealer on the block told me, "That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tried to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love

[Dave (2Pac):]
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(Yeah, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(Yeah, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(Uhm, nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya, yeah!!
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
(Nuttin but love)
Ain't got nuttin but love for yam, yeah!!
(Oaktown)
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya


The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me
Too much like him, so my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age, I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray?
I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die
say good-bye to the bad guy
That one, you fucked, when you passed by
Buck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

With nothing to lose
[The D.O.C:] I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
[Ice Cube:] That's why I got gang-related rhymes

Got nothing to lose
[The D.O.C:] I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
[Ice Cube:] That's why I got gang-related rhymes
[3x]

I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga
Zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
the realest motherfucker that you ever saw
I'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, I'm high
Living like I ain't afraid to die
And if you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

With nothing to lose
[The D.O.C:] I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
[Ice Cube:] That's why I got gang-related rhymes

Got nothing to lose
[The D.O.C:] I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
[Ice Cube:] That's why I got gang-related rhymes
[3x]

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'Motherfuck peace!'
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherfucker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity
And ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime
If you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

With nothing to lose
[The D.O.C:] I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
[Ice Cube:] That's why I got gang-related rhymes

They wonder what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest, motherfucker!
You know!
They wonder what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest!


Pssst... psssssst... ayo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever?
Tell me, which one?

They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me, unfortunately, âcause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high
Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it
Everybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?
Two to the head while I'm in bed
Leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
The line's busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway -- see ya later!
To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger, then I dash
Niggas don't like me, âcause I'm thuggin'
And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies -- ain't that a bitch?
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?
Then tell me, am I lost? âCause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run, I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well, Hell can't be worse than this, âcause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC
-11, âcause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now: You motherfuckers don't know me

"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas"
"Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated"
"Only fear of death..." "You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."
"You ghetto niggas..."

Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in Heaven: I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever? Are you scared to die?
Or will you scream when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is coming back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P
And Big Kato, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s who go down; I don't fear death


"Alright now, here we go"

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me?
I smoke a blunt and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and stayin' high 'til I die, my competition's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, you better duck
Go or I'll be forced to hit yo' ass up, I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why they sweat me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey!
I'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers
Who can I trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We livin' a drug life, THUG LIFE, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin' fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggas, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire

"Alright now, here we go"

These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin' switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas

"Alright now, here we go"

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin' weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doin' ninety, ah shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

Hahahaha! Thug Life, bitch! Goin' out like that


Are you still down? [3x]

Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "One time!"
Take your time to feel my record
And if you did, chill a second
My blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone
Are you still down?

Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?

I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine
Cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggas on the streets, man, listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way, I'mma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down

Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?

I wrote this for my critics and my enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "Baby, it's on!"
And now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, are you still down?

Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me [2x]
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?
Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me [3x]
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?
Are you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me [3x]
Are you still down, to raise 'em up?

That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger
Raise 'em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug life niggas be the sickest
You feel me?
Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
Are you still motherfuckin' down?
Old ho ass fake ass niggas
We out this motherfucker though


(Rule number one... niggas die, daily, hahahaha)
Hear me! Boo-yaow!
(Ready for whatever, hell yeah
What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggas be the craziest -- run up nigga!)

[2Pac:]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin', "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Had a motherfuckin' warrant but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon

(Yeah, niggas movin' somethin' in the nine-trey
It's all about makin' money, gettin' yours
And knockin' coppers off the motherfuckin' planet
Word to the motherfuckin' nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon' kill me
So Syke, get skanless nigga)

[Big Syke:]
Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heaven?
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul? Mama would have saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losing it
So fuck it! Take me I'm doing it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Committing sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm getting hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother
Til then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
If we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever

(Hahahahaha, that's my motherfuckin' nigga there
Big ballin'-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
On how it is to be a real motherfuckin' G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin' daily so you best be packin'
If you ain't, boo-yaow motherfucker!)

[2Pac:]
Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin' in Hell
Like I'm walkin' with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much pain in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin' to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin'
Got a nigga losin' hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
When niggas gettin' richer (mo' money)
Now tell me if you wanna live forever
Niggas dyin' so be ready for whatever

(Yeah, ready for whatever
Ready for whatever
Thug Life niggas and we be ready for whatever
Let me go like this, ready for whatever
Huh, Big Syke he be ready for whatever

And I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody

[*laughing*]

Thug style out this, motherfucker, niggas, throw ya hands in the air
If you got Jeep make ya speakers pop
I want motherfuckin' police tryin' to pull niggas over on this one
We takin' this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet

Hit me, I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm gettin' high off Buddha cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You can holler if you want to, please!
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew be, bleed!
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, now hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin, Down on Rikers Isle
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles

These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style

These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

I remember Uptown, run catch a kiss
Listenin' to Mr. Magic
Cuttin' up the hits And even though I had a habit
Makin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's with a gift of gab
Tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab Remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'
And jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style

These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (my nigga scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the mothafuckin' cross, but my force was wild
Mothafuckin' bitches

Swear y'all know nigga
Ever heard motherfucka say all in Kool-Aid know the flavor hahha
You mothafuckas all about my motherfuckin' hell being though [?]
This shit thuggish, fo' life, I told y'all, it's album three see

Motherfuckin' Young Thugs in this motherfucker

[Guard:] Yeah yeah, that's what they all say fool

[Prisoner:] Yeah what! Let me out then

[Guard:] Institutionalized, and this is your home...

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two
Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off
The penitentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail
Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell
I'm livin' proper, the coppers is havin' fits
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin' shit
I still remember my momma told me
Find the cop who killed your brother
Send him to Hell lookin' homely
Cause a real nigga love the law
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law
Keep pressin' your luck and get fucked, huh
Think a nigga don't know whassup 'cause he's locked up
But in the meantime, it's get swole get clean time
Concentrate on gettin' green time
And as the years go by, they forgot
About the small time soldier from the block, huh
To kill the crook they threw the book at me
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts
Did push-ups until I swole up
And then they offer me a furlough
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo'
They asked me if I changed much
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut
They started askin' me questions about my brother
And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm
Wait a minute, hold up
Makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him
He went home to find a tragedy
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me
And anybody else that wanna sweat me
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me
You better pray they never see me
Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets

When I get free, huh
When I get free, huh
When I get free

When I get free, huh
When I get free, huh
When I get free

When I get free


[2Pac (2Pac as Trusty):]
Ay Trusty Trusty
(What you want man?)
Aw nigga let me get one of them cigarettes
(Here! Shit!)
Come on bastard, get the phone for a nigga
(Use the phone)
Aw nigga get the phone for me man
(What's the number?)
323-65-45, tell her it's 'Pac

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me or them, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin' to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like a gauge, and in a rage, blow they balls off
Why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
My Main thang with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
Use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin' with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin' again

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

Hey, still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick, call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin' me baby, to a young
Motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin' while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street

Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

(When I get free!), believe that shit
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that phone (When I get free!) call motherfucker
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days
I'll pay these bitches back in spades (When I get free!)
Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes
We gonna play these bitches (When I get free!)
That's how we do this shit
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin' lights out!


Power...pow...power...

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?

Power enter my world

I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggas
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggas must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
The motherfuckin' law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?

[repeat in background:]
Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggas run the streets, fuck peace

Hey niggas, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas
Killin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin' mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?

[*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'*]

All you niggas out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggas, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molesters
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?

Rest in peace, to Kato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?


[2Pac:]
Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin like that?
Ah shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted in the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the Champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms, have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)

[Snoop Dogg:]
A toast to the gangsters

[2Pac:]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

[Snoop Dogg:]
Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

[2Pac:]
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down
The shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion
I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage
They out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

[Snoop Dogg:]
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream's to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

[2Pac:]
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant for two of America's most wanted

[Daz Dillinger (2Pac):]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[2Pac:]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

[Snoop Dogg:]
It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

[2Pac:]
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

[Daz Dillinger (2Pac):]
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

[2Pac:]
Biatch! Where you at? Where you at?
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Yeah, Death Row


[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]
(They say)
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
(That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off)

[2Pac:]
I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find

[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[C-Bo:]
I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my drawers
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

[B-Legit:]
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find

[D-Shot:]
Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
to the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
get in my way, then that ass gots to go
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'

[B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich (2Pac), E-40:]
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Where I can pile up my chips
And niggas call me a timer
(I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin')
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

[(2Pac), E-40:]
(C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich)
Da Bay, beitch!

[E-40:]
Down the steps 
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?
Best shake and bake all those I-was-finst-to-ask niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him

[Richie Rich:]
(Check this out)
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
More than twenty stitches, you behaved like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Heavy in the game
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find

[Ad-libs â 2Pac, C-BO & E-40:]
[2Pac:] Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo:] The whole Clickalation fool
[E-40:] Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
[2Pac:] Why them niggas actin' like they can't find us? Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at?
[D-Shot:] It's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?
[C-Bo:] Nigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit
[D-Shot:] It's a celebration
[E-40:] Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[D-Shot:] Young 'Pac is back
[2Pac:] Ay D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man?
Can we just go there and sock this shit up, please?
[D-Shot:] Hey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find
[2Pac:] Drinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane
[E-40:] A motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy
[2Pac:] You supposed to
[RIch:] Sideways to the next light, and to the next coast, poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'
[2Pac:] Money over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B.


[2Pac (Dru Down):]
Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah!)
It's all about you, one time!
(I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah!)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you
It's all about you! (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you
(Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeah)

[2Pac:]
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up
With this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, âcause this is all about you

[Nate Dogg (2Pac):]
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
(Yeah, nigga)
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[2Pac:]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas, âcause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa? And I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you, yeah, nigga, it's all about you

[Nate Dogg (2Pac):]
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
(Yeah, nigga)
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Hussein Fatal:]
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

[Yaki Kadafi:]
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

[Hussein Fatal:]
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch
From the West Coast to West Virginia

[Nate Dogg (2Pac):]
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

[Snoop Doggy Dogg:]
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel
I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video, you knahmsayin'?
And then, you nahmsayin', what make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch, on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video
I mean, damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same ho'
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah


[2Pac:]
Big Syke, Newt, Hank
Beugard, Big Sur
Y'all know how this shit go
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' O.G
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?

[2Pac:]
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hatin' niggas tryin' to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin'
Well are you still down nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh Benz flauntin' flashy rings, uh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous, and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, in low riders, and ski masks
Screamin' THUG LIFE every time they pass - all eyes on me

[2Pac:]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa (All eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin' high

[Big Syke:]
Hey, to my nigga 'Pac
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tech
Devoted to servin' this, Moet and pay checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin'
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin' I been there, came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta-free
Niggas can't stand me - all eyes on me

[2Pac:]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa (All eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa (All eyes on me), cause even gettin' high

[2Pac:]
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive, will I die, come on let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the mill ticket
Get your money, motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me

[2Pac:]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa (All eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life of a boss playa (All eyes on me), cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

[2Pac:]
Pay attention my niggas
See how that shit go
Nigga, walk up in this, motherfucker
And it be like, bing
Cops, bitches, everymotherfuckingbody
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
I got bustas, hoes and police watchin' a nigga, y'know
I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Livin' life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
Hehehe... it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some Ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa
I know y'all watchin', I know y'all got me in the scopes
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin' high
I know y'all know this is Thug Life baayy-bay
Y'all got me under surveillance, huh
All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'


I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
that get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, hoe!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers
To breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

Peep it, it was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride
I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screaming as they drill me
But I'm hard to kill (that's all you niggas got?)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man
And pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

My murderous lyrics
Equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops
'Cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble


[Roger Troutman:]
California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Dr. Dre:]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with the bomb-ass hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a

[Roger Troutman:]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Roger Troutman:]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[2Pac:]
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!

[Roger Troutman:]
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'

[Dr. Dre:] South Central
[2Pac:] Uh, that's right
[Dr. Dre:] Now make it shake

[Roger Troutman:]
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

[Dr. Dre:]
Shake it Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco

[2Pac:]
And you know L.A. up in here

[Dr. Dre:]
Pasadena where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good

[2Pac:]
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby

[Dr. Dre:]
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

[2Pac:]
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side
Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West coast, west coast


[George Clinton:]
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Looking hard, but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

[2Pac:]
Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleeding
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes
Open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe?
Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screaming: "Go 2Pac!" and I ain't stopping 'til I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now nigga look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player, getting high
And when I'm rolling by niggas can't see me!

[George Clinton:]
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

[2Pac:]
Been getting word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Saying they can get with us, but picture me getting served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be bumping out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothing but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penitentiary dick
Hitting bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alize and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss playa, fuck what you thought, though
My enemies deceased, die like a bitch
When my album hit the streets, niggas can't see me!

[George Clinton (2Pac):]
(Niggas can't see me)
(They can't see me)
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

[2Pac:]
You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't killed me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle n' roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rapping bring me money, then I'm rapping 'til I'm paid
I'm getting green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star, and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart
Niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

[George Clinton (2Pac):]
(Niggas can't see me)
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
(I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face)
(But you still can't see me)
You can't see me
(All up in your range, but niggas can't see me)
20/20 vision won't visualize
(I'm in the flesh baby, but you can't see me)
All those glasses won't help you realize
(You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me)
You can't see me
(Thug Life, baby)
(Don't believe everything you read!)
(Alize and weed)
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
(Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac)
Niggas can't see me
(I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
(This one's for you, BIG baby)
(Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me)
(Niggas can't see me)
You can't see me

See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me, you can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize
Visualize what you can't see


[2Pac:]
Ay what time is it nigga?
("I don't know.")
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
("Hell yeah.")
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room
("Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs
("Where K and them niggas at man?")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
("Ay, y'all seen my shoes?")
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
("Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit.")
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
("Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga.")
Aw nigga, damn

[2Pac:]
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantasy, AlizÃ© and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[2Pac:]
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time!
Gotta go nigga, gotta go
("Y'all know what time it is!")
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker

[Kurupt:]
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[Kurupt:]
Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'?
The only one not to leave
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
(You seem them bitches?)
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup?

[Big Syke:]
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said?
Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

[Big Syke:]
Ay, it's check out time
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga?
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
C'mon man, niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred

[Natasha Walker:]
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

We gotta go! Oooo!
We gotta, go!
We, hey!
We! We gotta go! Haaa!
We gotta, go! Haa!


[Daz Dillinger:]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time when I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack, I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time on lye
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

[2Pac:]
So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin'
No more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation, but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control, I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

[Method Man:]
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

[Kurupt:]
Well I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylactics
For protection so my fuckin' sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an, MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MC's, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

[Method Man:]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres
Like Hitler, stickin' up Jews with German Lugers
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket, blaow
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my Clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

[Redman:]
Lyrical gats spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted
Funk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Flip MC's like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it
I'm the one pushin' the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafeller for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for 9-nickel

[*in the background*]
[INS the rebel]


Hey Suge, what I tell you, nigga
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right
Watch this
Hey Quik, let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars
Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Eternally I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men

The hearts of men

My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight
So we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villain if ya let me
But motherfucker if ya do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga
Look inside the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
Smoke' em, fire and bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugging is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scared up, but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake
What will it take ?
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
Cause I've been sent
The hearts of men


Heaven ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is look

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation 
Across the nation, Mr. I-Get-Around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven!
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Heaven ain't hard to find

Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes 
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug? 
And have you ever made love 
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that AlizÃ©, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven!
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Hea-ven! It ain't hard to find

You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that?
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker,
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin 
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Hea-ven! Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find)
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
(Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize)
Hea-ven! Hea-ven! Hea-ven. Heaven
Hea-ven! It ain't hard to find
Hea-ven! Heaven
It ain't hard to find
It ain't hard to find
It ain't hard to find


[Nanci Fletcher (2Pac):]
Niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
With that funky sound, so funky
We be throwin' down
(This goes out to you playa)
(You know, you know who you are)

[2Pac:]
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me

[2Pac:]
Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for ya, nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
Ya could never be live
Until you die
See the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)

[(2Pac) Nanci Fletcher:]
(Gotta be afraid, donât let the evil of the money trap me)
(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
(So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)
(So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[2Pac:]
Curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency
Nigga that's why we're doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation
This information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
It's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members that call the fifty states
To keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate?
To live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
So much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared, cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see come fuck with me, I give that ass a try!
Nigga, Holla at me

[(2Pac) Nanci Fletcher:]
(Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)

[2Pac:]
I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin' just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' cause hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
Cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust; a no no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po po
Holla at me

[(2Pac) Nanci Fletcher:]
(So when you see me nigga)
(You better holla at me)
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
(Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me)

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

[K-Ci & JoJo:]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane; I'm for real

[2Pac:]
I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a brother wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can
Forgive me I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me - Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

[K-Ci & JoJo:]
How do you want it?
How does it feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real

[2Pac:]
Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk?
Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor
It's like erotic
Ironic, cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin'' switches on bitches like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery, I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these
Nights full of Alize
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

[K-Ci & JoJo:]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane
I'm for real

[2Pac:]
Raised as a youth
Tell the truth, I got the scoop
On how to get a bulletproof
Cause I jumped from the roof
'fore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major - my adversaries
Is lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gonna see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin' fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
Iâm with a clique thatâs quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it
How do you want it?

[K-Ci & JoJo:]
How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit 'cha
I ain't mad at 'cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'mma send this one out for y'all, know what I mean?
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha

[2Pac:]
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'member when you had a Jheri Curl didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh you's a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
Cause I ain't mad at 'cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at 'cha)

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha

[2Pac:]
We used to be like distant cousins
Fightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'
Knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad
I'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'
"Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
Cause you's a down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha

(a true down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha)

[2Pac:]
Well guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at 'cha

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(Hell nah I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(And I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
(I ain't mad at 'cha)
I ain't - mad - at 'cha
I ain't - mad - at 'cha


How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring, quiet y'all, incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school, he's getting by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out and blaze with me
2 in the morning and we still high assed out
Screaming "thug till I die" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinking I don't wanna die all alone, but now ya gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While trying to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed
Cause life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word is hell
Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's getting old
Plus with the drama we're looking out for your baby's mama
Taken risks, while keeping cheap tricks from getting on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gaming on dumb hotties at yo' parties
Me and you, no truer two
While scheming on hits
And getting tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried. Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dying days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

Bury me smiling with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way before kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride
Until I get free, I live my life in the fast lane
Got police chasing me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers, miss ya while your gone
You left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn?
Life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?

Life goes on homie
Gone on, cause they passed away
Niggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga
They're gonna be like, "Goddamn, them niggas came up"
That's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch
Hey Kato, Mental
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man
Don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more hold me no more
Yes it do yes it do yes it do


Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin' room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy

My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggas I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick 
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, vicious telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

[Interpretation of Method Man's "Bring the Pain":]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight
And fuck your boyfriend bitch, I want some ass tonight You know my steelo, Alize and Cristal, weed
Sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the, cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down clutchin' they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me?, laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin' no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (yeah nigga, no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (what, what nigga)

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (no pain nigga)
Let's go inside my astral plane (no pain)

Bury me that's what they all say
It's time to make a killin', sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say?, now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin' it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, Baptize the public
Now you all thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas'll bleed, fuckin' with me you'll be deceased
Never restin' in peace, nigga
With no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain

This year you motherfuckers gonna be dust
Thug Life nigga Westsiiide!


[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

[2Pac:]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, 'cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
'Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

[Flatline]

[2Pac:]
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
'Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up stranglin', tangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse 'cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss 
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
"Black Power!" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
'Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me now

[2Pac:]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

[Rappin' 4-Tay:]
Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin' bullets representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down
That's when I'll be around
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin' sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

[2Pac:]
Guess you figure you know me, 'cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night club drink and buzzed
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss 'em off, player shit with 4-Tay

[2Pac:]
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now

[2Pac (Rappin 4-Tay):]
(Only God, mane)
That right?
(That's real)
Hahahahahaha
(Fuck everybody else, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That's for the homie mental
(Hehehehe)
We up out


Yeah, clear enough for ya? (alright)
My niggas look mad
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Hoe bustas!

[2Pac:]
Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin'
"Know there's dope being sold", but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin' and my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'
Picture me rollin'

[Danny Boy (2Pac):]
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Ooh wee
(Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Yeah nigga!
Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?)

[Big Syke:]
I got ki's comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on RÃ©my
in front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine
Picture me rollin'

[Danny Boy:]
Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me

[CPO (2Pac):]
I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots. So what?
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac
(We caught 'em sleepin', he didn't peep you niggas creepin'?)
(This how we do it every weekend)
(I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit)
(CPO, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it)
(I get the liquor, and you could get the females)
(This crooked shit that we inflictin' gettin' street sales)
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm as cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen
Boss Hogg and this 'Pac nigga
Picture us rollin'

[Danny Boy:]
Picture me rollin'
Picture me
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'

[2Pac:]
Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin" roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there

I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch ass C.O.'s
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin' on y'all punk ass!
Picture me rollin', baby
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The D.A
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the hoe see me from here?

And all you punk police, can you see me?
Am I clear to you? 
Picture me rollin' nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day

Can you see me hoe?
Is y'all ready for me?
We up out this bitch
Any time y'all wanna see me again
Rewind this track right here, close your eyes
And picture me rollin'


[Richie Rich (2Pac):]
'Pac
(Hey)
What's happening
(Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby)
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
(Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch)
(It's time for me to uh regulate)
Fo' sho', hey
(Observe)
And you ain't going back?
(Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though)
This is for the honeys, the superstar
(I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga)
(You feel me?)
Well let 'em know

[2Pac:]
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uh.

[Richie Rich:]
Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

[2Pac:]
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

[2Pac:]
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

[Richie Rich:]
You can ride out with spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

[2Pac:]
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?

[Richie Rich (2Pac):]
It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
(You say you don't need a man, but I don't care)
(You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga)

[2Pac:]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
(I'd rather be yo' nigga)

[2Pac:]
Hey yo storm
Honestly I think I can fuck wit' a motherfucker like you
See I don't like a motherfucker that be all lonely and shit
All up under me, telling me we having gold, in case she gold ringing
When I'm coming home and all of that ol' crazy shit
What type of life I live

[2Pac:]
Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you

Yo 'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo
But I gotta do what I gotta do
I gotta run the streets you know
I ain't no clean up one minute, type ho'
You know

[Storm:]
Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, 'til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just cause we bone
Don't mean you own me
Nigga, I'm grown

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs

Hahhahaha yeah nigga

Aye a nigga that hang out more
Will come home, and love you better
You feel me sweetheart?
Let a nigga be free
Don't had a nigga all up on thee
Let him run with his niggas
Let the nigga run the street boo, let him run the streets

[Mutah:]
I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B.
Fetti over something
That's tellin' me don't run the streets

[2Pac:]
So tell me am I wrong ?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets

[Michel'le:]
You can run the streets with your thugs

Some of them breads and shit
I'll be back through later tonight
I'm hashing weed
We finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize
We finna eat that foods
Smoking ol' blunt
Lay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno and something
Then after that, shit do what after comes to mind baby
Just let a nigga run with the homies
Let me go kick it with my niggas
When I come back, I be all yours
For real

Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug!
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Was a nice middle-class nigga
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport
Plotting on a another way to catch a case
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My finger's on the trigger
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
From the homies, âcause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Straight from the hall to the pen
An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
He carried weight, like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, âcause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Shorty's gonna be a thug
Little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas

Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga

[2Pac:]
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, trick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous

[Nate Dogg:]
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

[2Pac:]
How's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous

[Nate Dogg:]
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

[2Pac:]
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin well
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous

[Nate Dogg:]
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous

[Nate Dogg repeats to end (2Pac speaks over):]
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
(Aiyyo. How the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35
Gettin him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches)


Aight, new drink
One part AlizÃ©, one part Cristal
Thug passion, baby
y'all know what time it is
This drink is Guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me
Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, knowhatimean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

[Kastro:]
Mayne! I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier, I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents
they got these derelicts
I throw was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather, than stand forever
Been thinkin' drinkin' over a felony
And hell of me
And how it will be in hella shit, people tellin' me to cool out
But they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about
My fuckin' cheddar cheese
and it pleases, passion of mine
Thuggin', huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watchin' just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with the rain twinklin'
Diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me, 'til I'm, old and wrinklin'
and These adversaries
They gonna have to be worryin'
Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion

[Jewell:]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
from the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!

[Napoleon:]
Now what if me
Turn this Hennessy into a robbery
The Prophecy probably suddenly switch and how it supposed to be
And Dirty money
Can't be evil cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there is only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
with a Thug Passion

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Puttin' down mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin'
I'm askin', what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to
That's what money and fame do, see they ain't true
Travelin' this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it, can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion, left me to fuckin' greatest
Load up and take shit

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

[Storm:]
Creep with me, through that immortal flow
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowin'
and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

[Jewell:]
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby ohhhwow!

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some AlizÃ© and Cristal, meanwhile
Buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me, she smiles; a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
"How does it feel?" what I'm askin'
While I'm rubbin' on that ass "Why you laughin'?"
see, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
baby I'm born to ball
thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion

[Jewell (DJ Quik):]

[2Pac:]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[2Pac:]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
And feared men grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin' on âyak
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin' 'til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'

[2Pac & Kastro:]
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
My nigga tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas despise, look in my eyes

[Kastro:]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
Gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryna tell you

[Edi Amin:]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin' greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game something D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open - the ridin' and smokin'
Collidin' with foes - in the worst place;
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin' game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

[2Pac & C-Bo:]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

[C-Bo:]
I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up hoes and keep mobbin' G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

[2Pac (Napolean):]
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise (look in my eyes)
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise (look in my eyes)

[Napoleon:]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happened then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got whats mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal when got some war stories for you

[Storm:]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawing from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
Cause the murderous tendencies in my mind, can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would you try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got you on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin' to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin' war stories

[2Pac:]

Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggas Fatal N Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is


What's your phone number?

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos; that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just 'cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on; still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't want to talk to me, just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number?
Are you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme
Take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

[2Pac:]
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

[2Pac:]
[*laughing*]
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

[Hussein Fatal:]
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
'Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

[Kastro:]
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

[Napoleon:]
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

[2Pac:]
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride

[Mussolini:]
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, ridin' Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Inglewoods banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

[E.D.I.:]
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'mma commence
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin', Thuggin'
To my fuckin' last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

[Kadafi:]
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a shorty I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth

[Mo Khomeini:]
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin'

[2Pac:]
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why - when we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die

Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives 'cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me 'cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitchâI betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

You leave your kids with your mama
'Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
'Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitchâI betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
'Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, 'cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? 'Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitchâI betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitchâI betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch


[2Pac talking:]
[*laughs*] We're going platinum nigga, we going platinum

[2Pac:]
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We get my nigga Treach from Naughty By Nature up in this motherfucker

[Stretch:]
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker

[2Pac:]
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin' quicker then a vic that's tryin' to keep from gettin' blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa, turn this Benz into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggas bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin' reckless
Niggas with a death wish step in with a TEC and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing, representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm what's mine
Some niggas need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me, nigga, and get blasted
With five deadly venomz

(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin' 'em up with
that old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)

[Treach:]
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
to the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
And after she's crossed out
I shout, "I'm de MC wit de nasty mouf!" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin' shit
Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin' shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
my sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom

[Stretch of Live Squad:]
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin' 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make 'em scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, something that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom

(Yeah Mad, fuck that! You know how we do
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)

[Majestic of Live Squad:]
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking all fake niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac.)

[2Pac:]
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I passed let the glass spray.
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin' blunts
Deadly venomz

(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache bout to clean shit up.)

[Apache:]
Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'mma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch.
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim

(Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit
YaknowhatI'msayin? Follow us, come along. YaknowhatI'msayin?
We takin this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.)


Guess who's back?

Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the MoÃ«t
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, "Hi," and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test... of givin
But be thankful that you're livin... blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
by Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back but now I snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

[Special Ed:]
"Yes I'm back" 
"2Pac is"... back!
[4x]

Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
one minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'mma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?

[Special Ed:]
"Yes I'm back" 
"2Pac is"... back!
"Yes I'm back"

"Yes I'm back, cause I never did front"


Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah

Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Looking down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' getting mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm giving but be thankful that you're living, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'mma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

[several times w/ minor variations:]
[2Pac:]
Holler if ya hear me!
[Sample:]
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me
PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, living it up
One way or another you'll be giving it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swinging like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block getting dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keeping my sound underground for ya
And I'mma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rolling in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Telling all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustling 'til other brothers bubble -

[several times w/ minor variations:]
[2Pac:]
Holler if ya hear me!
[Sample:]
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representing, never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waiting for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

[several times w/ minor variations:]
[2Pac:]
Holler if ya hear me!
[Sample:]
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"

[2Pac:] You're too near me, to see it clearly

[several times w/ minor variations:]
[2Pac:]
Holler if ya hear me!
[Sample:]
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"


[2Pac:]
Aw, yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground
When we come around
Stronger than ever

[2Pac:]
Back to get wreck, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
'Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me
She squeeze meâlady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem, saying "bye-bye"
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask "Why?", don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know!

[Shock G:]
Now you can tell from my everyday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix
Tryin' to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just 'cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Money B:]
What's up, love? How you doin'?
Well, I've been hangin', sangin', tryin' to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with?
That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister?
And your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low
Long as you know that I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know!

[2Pac:]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips 'cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll, are you down? I get around


Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feeling like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up
Huh, you got to keep your head up

Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears is rolling down your cheeks
You steady hoping things don't fall down this week
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's getting older and older and colder
From having the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is driving Benz
I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep your head up


Got any last words
Yeah I've got some last words
Ice Cube's in the muthafuckin' house
The nigga you love to hate

[Ice Cube:]
Here comes the nigga with the ruff, the terror
The paranoid, gots to get the boy
Get your steel cause I feel like a headbanger
Yeah I got a gang of shits, styles guns
My Uzi weighs a motherfucking ton
Bucking down one, bucking down two
Bucking down your crew, mutha fuck you
Pigs wear blue, I wear black, nothing but black
Cause Goddamn it's a brand new payback
Fuck Pat Sajak, never did nothing for a nigga
On the trigger the zigga the zag the nickel the bag
The nigga the sag the forty four mag got you running like a fag
So, keep your muthafucking jokes
Cuz, I'm that nigga with a fresh pair of locs
No yokes but smokes
Crakers and them dirty mackers friends aren't jackers
Get yah for your drawers, young niggas out to kill for the cause

Ice-T in the motherfucking house
L.A. Playa

[Ice-T:]
O- to the muthafuckin G, I break crazy
A lot of niggas hate me but they can't fade me
Stop me, clock me, cops wanna Glock me
But the punk motherfucking pigs can't stop me
UHH am I a G, I got proof
Banged in my youth, keep niggas on the roof
With a scope, dough, Cube keep the rope
2Pac'll string a nigga up if the mob don't
So whats up, punk?
You want what I got, step to me wrong fuck around and get shot
Your moms crying fuck her bust her
Bitch start screaming to me and I'll dust her
Pops got the LP phat, track on hit
Laid by the mutha fuckin' Bobcat
Ninety three suckas want me to go out
Throw the ho out, bitch muthafucker I'm rich

2Pac's in the muthafucking house
Nigga I'm loc'd, 2Pac's gonna get'cha motherfuckers
Got any last words

[2Pac:]
Now they're after me, why?, cause a nigga's Black
Spittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
Let em come step to a real muthafucker
(Boom Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets
Muthafucker Rednecks all the same
Fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off they White face
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it 
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast 
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz


[Statements variously said throughout song]

[Statements â 2pac (Dan Quayle):]
I was raised in this society so there's no way
You can expect me to be a perfect person cuz I'm a do what I'm a do
I am still thirsty
(There is absolutely no reason for a record like this to be published
It has no place in our society.)
They gotta understand me
(Withdraw on this record.)
That's how I feel I'm a do whatever I like. I am not a role model


[2Pac:]
Daddy's home...

Heh, so?
You say that like that means something to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin home talkin that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS... fuck you!

[2Pac:]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Wycked:]
Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[2Pac:]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know 
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that "Born to be a father" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[2Pac impersonating his father:]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!


[2Pac:]
So what the fuck you talking about?! Aw, shit
Goody, goody, gumdrops
Nigga, get your hoodie and your gun cocked
Rock it till the drum stops, hip hop
Even if my shit flip flop
It probably wouldn't stop, talk shit and get socked
How ya hang em?
Know a realer nigga? You could bring him
If I don't represent the shit, I'll kick it
We could sway him, hunh! As if I know ya
Then I could show ya
But if I don't know, I gotta .44 fo' ya
So, so peep game, at point blank range
The fame can't change what the game maintains
Strange! Went against the grain
Aw shit! Flick or no flick I trips for no bitch
Catch up on your pimpin', I ain't simpin', I'm a diss her
Couldn't be my sister if she's actin' like I missed her
Tell me why they, tell me why they, tell me why they play me
Don't these niggas know that neither one of y'all can fade me
I ain't big, I ain't buff, I ain't deisel
But fuck wit 2Pac and pop goes the weasel
Me and Threat made a bet on how many fellas
Would jock a mothafuckin' real nigga cause they jealous
They do it for the fame
Explain, insane
What's in a name? What's in a name?
Peep game

[Deadly Threat:]
Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

[Deadly Threat:]
Killa Cali
The state where they kill
Down wit Oaktown? What's up homie, can I chill?
The bitches looking funny
Film at elev,film at eleven wit they minds on they heaven
Wit they .357
-Where you at?
-On the freeway, leaving LA
-OK, see you when get here loc
-OK
-Here I am. Here I am
-Goddamn that was quick
-Told ya I was coming. Who is that? Is that your woman?
-Na, that's just a hoochie looking for some juice
-What's up my nigga? What ya know? A nigga got a little bigger
That's all folks know
Fat gold ropes
Gotta keep a low key for my attack
When I approach, I want the diamonds, the pearls
The round the way girls
Cuz baby got, baby got back out this world
Would you give a fee? Never
Fly like a feather
Make more money than your daddy and your mama put together
The game is to be sold, not to be told
So buy it
Can't afford it?
Low budget hoes gotta brother
Peep game

[Deadly Threat:]
Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

[Deadly Threat:]
Don't sell out
Get the hell out
Cause here I come
Hit em with my bop gun
They came and they blast
We got witt they ass
And oh, pop this vest and all the rest of that mess
Coming through like Terminater 2
Boost your crew cuz we ain't afraid of you
You know what time it is wit me once the clock stike 3
We going coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs. Whooo eeii!!!

[Deadly Threat:]
Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

[2Pac:]
Time to get paid, time to get paid. Check
Time to represent the west homie, nuttin' but a vest on me
Got my hands on my Glock, eyes on the prize
First sucka jump, first nigga die
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme mine like I told ya
Hard as a boulder
Motha fuckin soulja
Boom bam boom!! It's a stick up
Vice president Dan Quayle eat a dick up
Peep game

[Deadly Threat:]
Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

[2Pac:]
Punk motha fucka
Fuck all those motha fuckas, they all can eat a mothafucking dick up
Word up. Fuck the police. I don't give a fuck
Bobcat in this mothafucka boy
Big up! Big up! To the criminals
Fuck em
"This is serious business"
Yeah, microphone mafia
2Pac, Threat, Bobcat
93 shot
Yeah nigga, bitch


"You could get the finger.. the middle!" 
"Come and get some!" 

[2Pac:]
Ahh yeah, they love to point the finger
"You could get the finger.. the middle!"
"Come and get some!"

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
You could get the finger...the middle!
[4x]

[2Pac:]
I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggas need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat getting major paid
But when I get my check they taking tax out
So, we paying for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are getting rich
Whooping on thugs and robbing drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, being a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggas ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for trying to earn they stripes in the dark
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
You could get the finger...the middle!
[4x]

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
"You could get the finger.. the middle!"
"Come and get some!"

[2Pac:]
As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggas run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's getting hectic, niggas run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggas on the block trying to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're trying to sleep
I'm steady pumping bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to busting, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
at 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
You could get the finger...the middle!
[4x]

[2Pac:]
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't going back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers.. (hahaha!) point the finga

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch!
You could get the finga! The middle!
[11x]


"I got a head, but ain't no screws in it"

Roll up and get swoll up, hold up
How ya gonna play me like a sunkin dunkin donut?
I ain't came a long way to get checked
So give me respect when I get wreck
Or get your motherfuckin chin checked
Once again, it's your friend outta Oakland
Hoping I can rock the shit to get ya open
Say your looking for some real shit
Then catch a funkified batch
Like that!
Oakland's on the map
2Pac is on the big screen strivin
Gotta love a nigga for survivin
I wear alot of old schools jewels
Look how the fools drool, ooohh
Stop lookin at me hard cause you're buffer
But I'll just buck them bigger motherfuckers
Turnin men to suckers
Niggas wanna start a little ruckus
Better duck cause I'll be poppin' them motherfuckers
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
Hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right
Then hit em wit the uppercut, duck quick
Shit outta luck, fucked and stuck with that rough shit
Fuck a pop song, fuck a video, fuck Arsenio, fuck the radio
Do you hear me though?
Give a holla to my niggas in the pen
And my murderous partners wit their Mac 10s
I represent the real cause I'm ill, G
Glock cocked the day they kill me
I'm representin'

Peace to Redman, Treach, Vin Rock, Kay Gee the great one
Mary J. Blige, Pete Rock and Troy, the late son
Heavy D, CL Smooth, and Queen Latifah
Too Short, Tony Toni Tone, LayLaw beat cuts
Ed, the special motherfucker and the Lover
The Tribe, A Tribe Called Quest, and Jungle Brothers
Das EFX, EPMD, and Ice Cube
House of Pain: funky blunted ass white dudes
Cypress Hill, yeah, the ill niggas
Digital Underground: my real niggas
Raw Fusion, Organized Konfusion

TLC, Eric B., Rakim, then Scarface
Stretch, Maj, K-Low, pumpin the Squad's bass
Thorough Heads, Poonannynans, The Click
E-40, The Governor, and Richie Rich
Young Guns in the house pumpin the flava
DJ Ditch for their behavior
Off the head, my freestyle flow
Just a couple of motherfuckers that I know
I'm strictly representin 

1 motherfucker, 2 motherfucker, 3 motherfuckers
Damn, who did I forget? 

I'm a soulja, daddy was a soulja
Strong in the struggle
Must contend so it's on
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
Mad motherfuckers
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's
Ah shit!
Pulled up in a benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it
To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit
Now they wanna ban me (Told ya)
All I wanted to be was a soulja
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
Huh, I'm representin'


Ghetto!
[*laughter echoes*]
I've changed?
You motherfuckers kill me....
I've changed?

It ain't that I've changed
But it's strange how you motherfuckers rearrange
When I found fame
Point ya finger at tha bad guy!

You know what my momma used to tell me
If ya can't find something to live for...
...then you BEST, find something ta die for

[Curtis Mayfield:] "If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!"
[*repeat the above throughout*]

Deep deep

La'tasha Harlins, remember that name...
Cause a bottle of juice... ain't something to die for

Young Quaid, remember that name...
Cause all you motherfuckers
That go to your grave with that name on your brain
Cause jealousy and recklessness is NOT, something to die for

All you niggas out there [*echoed laughter*]
Look how the cracker crumbles
When I say 'all you niggas' (all you niggas)

Unite
One nigga, teach two niggas
Four niggas teach more niggas
All the poor niggas
The pen niggas
The rich niggas
The strong niggas
UNITE

There's more of us than there is of them
Look around...
Check your strip

Deep deep
That's something to die for

Black
That's something to live for

What do I know?


[Lawyer:]
Mr. Shakur, can you please explain the meaning behind your violent lyrics?

[2Pac:]
Explain the meaning?
The fuck these niggas talking bout?

[*sounds of running and sirens in background*]

[Kid:] Damn...
[Cop:] Police, FREEZE!
[Kid:] Can't get shit off!
[Cop:] I said FREEZE you miserable black son of a bitch!
[Kid:] What, come on, come on!

[*gun shot*]

My attitude is shitty
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
The critics or the cops?
The courts or the crooks, don't look so confused
Take a closer look:
Niggas get they neck broke daily
Trying to stay jail free
What the fuck does Quayle know
What young black males need?
Please tell me
Message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
Huh, I pack a nine millimeter cause I gotta
Living hotter than the 4th of July, if I gotta die, I gotta
Momma told me, "Don't let em fade me...
...nigga don't let em make you crazy!"
Game is what she gave me
Gotta watch your back, strapped
Real niggas rat-pack
If you get your ass taxed, bring a gat back
That's not the way we made it
That's just the way it is
Slangin rocks, fed a nigga's kids
I came up
My message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
Cops pull me over, check my plates, but I'm legal
You couldn't get me, figure fuck with a niggas people
They got me trapped, gat with the motherfucking hammer back
Cops on my back, just cause I'm black, SNAP
Now I'm guilty?
Message to the censorship committee
Who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
All you punk police will never find peace 
On the streets til the niggas get a piece, fuck em!
They kill you to control ya
Pay top dollar for your soul
Real niggas don't fold, straight souljah!
Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police, hear them screaming
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police, hear them screaming
(I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police, screaming
(I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police, screaming
(I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
Fuck em! Can't find peace on the streets
Til the niggas get a piece, fuck police (I hear ya!)
The niggas scream fuck em!
Motherfucking punk police (I hear ya!)
Thinking they run the motherfucking streets
It's mo' niggas than it's police
Think (I hear ya!)
One nigga, teach two niggas
Teach three niggas, teach fo' niggas (I hear ya!)
Teach mo' niggas, and we could run this shit!
I hear ya!

They finally pulled me over and I laughed
Remember Rodney King and I blast on his punk ass (I hear ya!)
[10x]


[2Pac speaking: ]
Yo, law!
Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah! Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back
And I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?
Puffin' on this indo
In the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean

I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk, picture that
I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it

Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas [3x]

Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said - whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though - always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew, that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said "Bet!," and never let 'em see me sweat
Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
Cause they can all suck dick - it's strictly for my niggas

Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas [3x]

This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to get 'cha
I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome; niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah! And I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me - ring the alarm, G
Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
Without they backup
When they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggas at the show
So they know, not to play me like a ho
Strictly for my...

Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggas [3x]


Eat a dick up

"Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money"

[Stretch of Live Squad:]
Struggling, juggling, got it to the black man
Eating the scams like I was motherfucking Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggas with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbing for a fee, it gets hard on the fucking streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cause either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Sticking up spots and jumping in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumbling
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cause a niggas straight strugglin'

"Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money"

[Majestic of Live Squad:]
I'm used to being poor, but now I'm sick of struggling
I thought about bumping, but mother-fuck juggling
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm stepping
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it going on
If you come up stepping you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfucking house, I'm struggling
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be laying in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin'

"Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money"

[2Pac:]
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothing changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
Till I call back, niggas running free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Struggling and striving, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clicking on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowing motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumbling
See me on the block, struggling
And rolling with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggas ass, blast
Straight strugglin'

"Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money"


Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was the product of a heated lover.
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what to do with me.
Was I somebody they despised?
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
And poor momma can't control me
"Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!"
A ticken timebomb, can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic 
Could care less death or success
Is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless
Now the streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow.
[2x]

I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed wearin' a vest
Hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite the bullet
Hand on the trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Counting pennys over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's the only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
'Cause these suckers love ta' spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family, he snapped;
Shot up half the block to bring them back
The streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow.
[2x]

I'm dangerous when drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Henessey makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM 
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest by a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, body bags, and the gun firing
Tell Bush, "Push the button!" 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
The streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow.
[2x]

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
This goes out to my partners in the Live Squad
(like it ain't nothin')
And all my partners involved in that 187
Watch your back
('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There got to be a better way
('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There's too many of us in the cemetery
('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
Come on, what we gonna do now
('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow


Yo 'Pac
That's right, hehehe
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police 
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything
Yeah.
Niggas just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass nigga shit

Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 lay under my head so I don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see 
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; oh!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; oh!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!) 
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' TEC-9
They know they scared to see us sober
(ah) Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean (fuck that) or be a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; oh!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; oh!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and oh
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too

It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth, oh!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth, oh!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too


Yo 'Pac yo, I heard you got beat up by the police

[2Pac:]
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak

[2Pac:]
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessings
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Love's gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)

[Eminem:]
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed, why do I stress? It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

[Kastro:]
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what i know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80s did
To us baby kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet

[Young Noble:]
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, it's curtains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a struggler
If the lord loving us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Running up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze
Biblical times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they giving me mine
Black Cotton

[Eminem:]
Nobody don't care

Nobody don't care

I ain't got time for this, man I'm out

[Dido samples from "Do You Have a Little Time":]
You should stop for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

[2Pac:]
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, just give me space and we'll get better
And maybe we won't argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where you been and who you with, I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

(not that I don't trust you)

[2Pac:]
Calling at my house then hanging up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lying
Fighting back the urge to just start crying
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?

[2Pac:]
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yelling at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
Coming over crying just to get me feeling guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breaking out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leaving
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But, baby, until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope you understand why I'm busting
Not because we bust our love, hah, don't you trust me?

[2Pac]
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

[Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
'Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men
Like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

[Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[2Pac]
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this Brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress, never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy 'cause I chose to puff a blunt
And drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace, we gotta find peace and end the war in the streets; my ghetto gospel

[Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

[2Pac]
Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hell-bound


Hahah! Yeah nigga fuck that gin and juice (Hennessy)

I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dying days
Ain't nuttin wrong with getting paid, so nigga blaze

Walking through the streets wearing jewels, breaking niggas making moves

Threw the sack to his lil' niggas working the set
And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

[2Pac:]
I'm loyal to the game

Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still coming up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[Young Buck:]
Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[Lloyd Banks:]
Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

[G-Unit & 2Pac:]
Heh
YA!
2Pac's in this motherfucker!
Uh!
G-Unit in the motherfuckin' house
50!
Banks!
Buck!


[2Pac:]
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's getting crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like trying to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been moving these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stacking G's, buying all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still coming up
I'm getting paid, pulling razors on niggas when they running up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicing motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Brothers we better get hip"

[Big Syke:]
My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catching static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with baking soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yelling that he telling get to me, no surprise, nigga

"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Brothers we better get hip"

"And come off this trip"

[DJ Quik:]
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extorting scheming and scamming me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder having to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be filling my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rapping I'm talking cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, riding by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no coming back
From him scrapping when niggas was packing and he wasn't packing too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Told life you'd be back" "There you were"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"
"Everybody look around" "There is no hope"
"Prince of peace must hear our plea"

"Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
If this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!"


"Niggas!" Yeah... uh...
"Niggas!"

[2Pac:]
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
My two 9s go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
...uh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
Licking off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas

"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha
"Niggas!" I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do

[Jadakiss:] HA! Uh.
Aiyyo!

[Jadakiss:]
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowadays they worry me
My bars is therapy, as long as you using 'em thoroughly
Muah 'til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
And I'm a product of the 70s
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eating wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speaking wit'chu
I know you got a gun but I'm hoping you keep it wit'chu
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
Know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath
Ruff Ryders, D Block, and of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
"Niggas!" Yeah, niggas
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas, ha-ha
"Niggas!" I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do

"Niggas!" Nigga! Can't fuck with us


Oh I posted bail? I'm out this motherfucker? I can go?!
Aw, fuck y'all! Ay fuck the judge!
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attorney, the prosecutor
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box, fuck all y'all!
Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gon' see me in this motherfucker again!
Drop that shit L G
Let these ol' punk-ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit for the '94
Niggas ain't goin' back to court, you stank ass bitches

I'm stuck in jail, the D.A.'s tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up - I ain't trippin'
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin', they askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep! They takin' Polaroids
And I'm tryin' to use the phone, but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my Glock, cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' co-llect calls to my ol' bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshit bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail

(Out on bail) You know what fuckin' time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH! I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin' cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin' product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin' out with the O.G.'s, shootin' up the clubs
And momma told me, don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me, then it's on g
Got me sittin' in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me, and the shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets, I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous, I'm on bail

(Out on bail) You know what fuckin' time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH! I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin' cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

Motherfuckers tryin', to harass a player
Man I ain't goin' for this ol' crazy ol' shit
Dealin' with you scandalous bitches
Y'all need to pop some of these crooked ass motherfuckin' judges
But here go the motherfuckin' fetti, I'm out on bail
I'll see you motherfuckers at the next show
By the way, where is my bitch?
You know, that's that ol' real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine
Y'knahmsayin? I wouldn't waste yo' motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, it's that real shit
Talkin' 'bout that shit you can be tellin' your grandkids about y'know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This is for my fuckin' nigga 'em and the motherfuckin' boys
In case you wonderin', we doin' this shit, hell motherfuckin' yeah
An ounce of that shit, sittin' in yo' motherfuckin' lap
Now press rewind nigga


Scott, Storch. Hey!

[2Pac:]
Why'd you slang crack? I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent

[2Pac:]
Crazy, I gotta work with what'chu gave me
You claiming I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust heading for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for saying "Fuck the law"
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga gotta do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested
And if I don't say "yes" a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay testing
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are getting restless
Walking around, ready to light shit up
But since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust, huh
They make a nigga be a killer; I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me, huh
I need loot, so I'm doing what I do
And don't say shit until you walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nuttin left to lose, so I'm singing nigga blues

[2Pac:]
Why'd you slang crack? I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent

[2Pac:]
Poppa need brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do?
My little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, huh
And you're hooked on my "I Don't Give a Fuck" look
Make your rules, I'mma break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em, you show me bacon I'mma take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
To my brothers in the barrio
You're living worse than the niggas in the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police?
Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I play the trick
For a blond-haired, blue-eyed, Caucasian bitch
Down with my homeboy Rich, huh
Fuck a snitch and a groupie-ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home
So he can go out and bone, huh
And you wonder why we blazing niggas
Cause you punks having babies can't raise the niggas
And they down to be fuck-ups too
Drinking forties of brew, huh, singing nigga blues

Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Now I'm heading for the motherfuckin' pen
[3x]


[2Pac:]

[2Pac:]
Posse deep as I role through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep, in our Jeeps
Laying so long you think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbing niggas through the teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play tuffy
Last time them niggas rushed me, I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothing jumping but these buck shots
Them niggas got enough knots, I'm popping corrupt cops
Ya motherfuckaz catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfucking soulja, ready to role and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleeping
Role to the door, through a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep popping, cuz wouldn't stop until they rugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke rising from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
20 cops, one for every year in jail
Trying to keep a nigga down, but ya failed
Before I let ya take me, I told ya
Fuck being trapped, I'm a soulja

[Eminem:]
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G, cuz that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that ain't you, you just fronting
You ain't?

[2Pac:]
It's 2Pac in the mad bitch
In them six-'fo, rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Getting ghosts on them bitches in the town
Busting out the backseat, nigga when we clown
Homie is you down?
B got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up 'fo she spank shit
Comming round the corners, spitting rounds
They paying homie down
Caught them sucka ass bitches outta bounce
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
Now tell me how that sound?
A double date laced with hate, make 'em pray for the judgement day
Stinking BIATCH!

[Eminem:]
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G, cuz that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that ain't you, you just fronting
You ain't? (2Pac)

[2Pac talking:]
I wanted to bring back that reality
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin' Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battling niggas three times my size

Watch this uppercut, here it comes..
Watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come
Look out, watch my arms..

[2Pac:]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Comming equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? Stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose running these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doing 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a bitch

[2Pac:]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu falling from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? Nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? Nigga!

[2Pac:]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He trying fuck me out my cash, I'ma blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go don't need to roll for the truck, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't putting down my Glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
I'ma show you not to ever play a true nigga (ha-ha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rapping motherfucker we can do this

[2Pac:]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu falling from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? Nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? Nigga!

[E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz:]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if I'ma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let 'em
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget 'em
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret 'em
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends and the felons
We all lost souls tryna find our way to heaven

[2Pac:]
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu falling from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? Nigga!
Now you know you should have ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? Nigga!

[E.D.I. Talking:]
To all the comrades no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!
Thug Life we still living it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!


Hahaha, right, thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?

Mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck
Can you picture a middle finger out the window
Gettin' fucked of liquor; get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black
So be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me, what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki'
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game
Like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried
'Cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
[3x]

Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money
But you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes
These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hating hoes
Freaking down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me

Thug for life, beyatch! Yeah, nigga
Thug Life, from now until for motherfuckin' forever
Have-nots in this, motherfucker


[2Pac:]
Hahahaha, man, you crazy

See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
'Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

[Nate Dogg:]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, 'cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, 'cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[2Pac:]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
'Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the back streets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
'Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

[Nate Dogg:]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, 'cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, 'cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[2Pac:]
I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax 'cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

[Nate Dogg:]
I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, 'cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, 'cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

[2Pac:]
Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too
We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me


Maybe it's the thug in me
[5x]

[2Pac:]
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs
And running from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, till my ass die
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fuckin' with them tramp-ass sluts you supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you, all up in the skirt
Now you looking like a jerk cause she hurt you
Now head's up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot - who do you love?

Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me

[2Pac:]
I'm living that, thug life baby!
Steady smoking indo, going crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark, do you love me?
Everybody's talking 'bout they, KNOW ME
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies
Tell me what you need when you, SEE ME
And we can get it on, BEOTCH, take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number baby call me when you lonely
Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high 'til I die, and strapped with my fo'-five
Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
Thug for life nigga balling
I'm getting tired of these hoes trying to play me
You can't fade me and my niggas going crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin, and constantly mean muggin
Breakin' the bitches that be bugging tell me who do you love?

Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?


To my niggas that went out in line on duty
21-gun salute! One love, one thug, one nation
(Let's get down, let's do this!)
21-gun salute! (Come on, yeah, let's do this!)
21-gun salute! (Come on, come on, let's do this!)
All the time I beâ¦

Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga, close your mouth!
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest, you a punk
Or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, this is how you made me
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy

Against all odds, hopin' my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote

I heard he was light skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: "Why you lie?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds

I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote, against all odds

Puffy gettin' bribed like a bitch, to hide that fact
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a "hasa", Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die; goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga

Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds

21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, being soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want war


[*"To Live & Die in L.A." fades out*]

[Snipped of a religious TV show:]
God has a plan, and the Bible unfolds that wonderful plan through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior and that Christ is returning someday soon To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy

[2Pac:]
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

[2Pac:]
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle screaming, "Fuck they feelings!"
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothing free, get back what you earned
No doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy

[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain (blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

[2Pac:]
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowing
Everybody kissing ass to go to Heaven ain't going
Put my soul on it, I'm fighting devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto
Doing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly
Babylon beware, coming for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, making legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waiting for signs
God coming, she's just taking her time (haha)
Living by the Nile while the water flow
I'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go
Brothas getting shot, coming back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy

[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
(what!)

[2Pac:]
The preacher want me buried, why? Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?
While the preacher being freaky you say "honor God's people"
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop?
Waiting to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders
Knowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain time in B.C
It's hard enough to live now in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My Thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this, and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this, and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people sayâ¦

[Prince Ital Joe (2Pac):]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord

Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us unevil
For God is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever and ever


[2Pac:]
Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
That blows like a 12-gauge shotty, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

[2Pac:]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-la-la la la la la

[2Pac:]
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me
Through my diamonds, when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, hail Mary

[2Pac:]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-la-la la la la la

[2Pac:]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile
We're too crazy to be humble; we ballin'
Catch me, father, please, âcause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!

[2Pac:]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-la-la la la la la

[Kastro:]
They got a APB out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me, thug-livin', gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

[Young Noble:]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw
That's when I'm deadin' ya, feet first
You've got a nice gat, but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
âCause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

[Kadafi:]
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

[2Pac:]
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-la-la la la la la

[Prince Ital Joe:]
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty; hail Mary, hail Mary!

[2Pac:]
Westside, Outlawz
Makaveli the Don, solo
Killuminati, The 7 Days


[Malcolm X prison scene:]
Yo, Jackson! A 231549
Yeah, close four! Comin' down!
Crichlow! A 5991301
Close five! Comin' down!

[2Pac:]
My homeboys in Clinton And Rikers Island
All the Penitentiaries
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon
All the political Prisoners
San Quentin (Look at Satan) (I see him)
All the jailhouses, I'm with you

[2Pac (Tyrone Wrice):]
Yeah, one thug, one thug
(How do we keep the music playin'?)
You're listenin' to the sounds of one thug
One thug, one thug, how do we get ahead?
You're listenin' to the sounds ofâ¦

[2Pac:]
I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead?
If daytime is for suckers, then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child
I wonder now, how do we outlast?
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!

[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]
How do we keep the music playin'?
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)
How do we get ahead? (Hold ya head!)
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)
Livin' fast, too fast

[2Pac:]
These felonies be like prophecies
Beggin' me to stop, 'cause these
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'âis this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, 'cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Sayin', "Please show a playa love"âhold ya head! (Hold it!)

[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]
How do we keep the music playin'?
(You got to hold ya head!)
How do we get ahead? (Come on, hold ya head!)
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
(Yes, hold ya head!)
Livin' fast, too fast
(The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'â¦)

[2Pac:]
God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!

[Tyrone Wrice (2Pac):]
How do we keep the music playin'?
(You got to hold ya head!)
How do we get ahead? (C'mon, hold ya head!)
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
(Yes, hold ya head!)
Livin' fast, too fast
(You got to hold ya head!)
(How do we keep the music playin'?)
(Yes, you got to hold ya head!)
How do we get ahead?

[2Pac:]
No matter how hard it get, feel me?
Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book
Watch the stars, get some pussyâwhatever!


[*crowd noise*]

[Press release:]
In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli".
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pacâexcuse meâMakaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers.
Jay Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everybody wants to know is:
Why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pacârather Makaveliâwas not available for comment, but released this statement:

[2Pac talking:]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money, riders and punks â which side are you on?

[*gunshots followed by several encroaching footsteps*]

These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo Shit, Bring it!

[2Pac:]
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride for survival
Money-making plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes 'cause they breed freely
See me ride! Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me
Know what I mean? I hit the scene
Niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fucking nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down, to hell is where we send 'em
My whole team; trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West Coast rider, coming right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free; bomb first

[2Pac:]
We bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

[E.D.I. Mean:]
For so many days, in so many ways
We've been ducking strays they delivers
But still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game
For the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose?
Non can serve us
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch

[2Pac:]
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first then we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

[Young Noble:]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?
But I'm from Jers' and we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin' chips, gettin' rich, even though it's hard
Trying to creep through these halls and brawls
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, 'cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time

[2Pac:]
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

[Start of "Hail Mary"]
Let us pray, my niggas
For we have definitely sinned


[2Pac (E.D.I. Mean):]
Outlawz, go ahead, in this
No doubt
Death Row, Makaveli Records
(You can call me daddy, uh)
(I'll be ya daddy, that's right, uh)
(Just like daddy)
(Fo' the ladies)
Hahaha

[2Pac & Singer:]
Come with me and in time we'll grow 
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

[E.D.I. Mean:]
I met her when she was younger
Real daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
And to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin' but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah (souljah) yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy

[Makaveli:]
To alleviate the stress, spendin' time wit' you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin' loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin' the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin' like you dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me

[2Pac & Singer:]
Come with me and in time we'll grow 
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin' what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy

[Young Noble:]
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure

[2Pac (Singer):]
(Just like daddy) come with me and in time we'll grow
(Just like daddy) Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
(Just like daddy, c'mon) Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
(just like daddy. Sunshine turns to rain)
(Baby, I can take away ya pain just like daddy)

[2Pac:]
Throw me a cigarette, dawg! [*inhales*]
They got me feelin' crazier than a motherfucker
I got Bad Azz in this motherfucker
Makaveli the Don, representin' the Outlawz
Bad Azz representin' the LBC Crew
So what'cha wanna do? Y'know how we do it

[2Pac:]
Puffin' on lye, hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy

[2Pac:]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Oh yeah, I feel crazy

(Tell 'em about it!)

[2Pac:]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records â check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak â all I heard wasâ¦

[2Pac:]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga going' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy

(One, two, three, four)

[2Pac:]
I see bloods and crips runnin' up the hill
Lookin' for a better way
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
'Cause even thug niggas pray
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent â casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "Nigga, get paid!"
No one can understand me â the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him sayâ¦ (Thug Life, baby!)

[2Pac:]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
Crazy
Crazy
Crazy
I feel crazy (crazy)

[Bad Azz:]
God, help me out here, 'cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
'Cause money's like a strong prescription drug
It's got me addicted to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper with the pictures of the president's head, damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin' right or did life livin' dumb
Who has the answers? I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) 'Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind (through my mind)
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time
(You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time)

[2Pac:]
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy
I feel crazy
Time goes by, puffin' on lye
Hopin' that it gets me high
Got a nigga goin' crazy

[2Pac:]
I feel fucked up in this bitch
I smoked half a ounce to the head. Chocolate Thai, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, Buddha â all that shit!
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker
And Hennessy don't help
And Hennessy don't help
Thug Passion in this muh'fucker
Makaveli the Don puttin' it down to the fullest
Maximum overload
3 Day Theory â Killuminati to your body
With the impact of a 12 gauge shotty
Double-I slugs, no love, straight thugs

One time for my niggas in the jail cell, (One time for my niggas locked up)
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell, (One time for my niggas and shit, one time)
One time for my niggas in the jail cell (One time)
One time for my niggas doin' life in Hell (One time for my niggas locked down)
One time for my niggas on the Death Row
(One time for my niggas on the Row)
For my niggas on Death Row
One time for my niggas livin' broke (Westside, California style, LA!)
One time for my niggas livin' broke (You know what time it is, no doubt)
One time for my niggas in the jail cell (Get high, puffin' on lye)
Wonder if it get me high, yeah


In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

[2Pac:]
Why explain the game
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
If victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean
Itchin', givin' suckers plenty space
Have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope they backwards
Make track burst, whenever I rap
Attack
Words bein' known to explode on contact
Extreme at times
Blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me
Truely effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice
Got a death wish, bitch
Run but face, being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti
Unload it
Cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

[2Pac:]
Code 3
Attack formation
Pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives
Come closer
Exhale the fumes
We got memories fadin' fast
A slave for cash
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now. How you like it, raw
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws
Never surrender
Death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out
Fuck the world cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin'
Believe in me and you could see the victory
A warrior with jewels
Will you picture me?
Life of and outlaw

In the life we live as thugs (no doubt)
Everybody fuckin' with us (yes!), so can't you see (life of an outlaw)
It's hard to be a man (soldiers in position, attack formation)
Ridin' with my guns in hand
(No retreat, no surrender)

[Young Noble:]
City under siege
It's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves
G, deep from the street
Plenty beef
I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb peep
This nigga from behind tryin' to creep
No half-wits, no straps, jack
It's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad,it snatched my style on death
Tell the reaper I was sent to get ya
Snip with clippers
Get the picture
I wrote my life down as a scripture

[E.D.I. Mean:]
And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely
Where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy
Everybody livin' soley for themselves
Too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needin' it
You know we lost hope and we needin' it
Wit' the evil it's forever
But it might be low down, scandalous
Like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit
6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approved to go on swole and now I got it

[Kastro:]
Uh, crack my window
Knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into mornin'
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt
Outlaw
Outta my mind, outta time
You're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, cause it is
Perhaps finally I'll adapt to it over the years as an outlaw

[(2Pac) Napoleon:]
(Eh, Napoleon)
What's up, nigga?
(Would you die for me, nigga?)
Hell yeah
(Would you kill for me, nigga?)
On my grandmother, nigga
(Ah yo)
What's up
(Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out)

[Napoleon:]
Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike
Thug life break night
Drink 'til we fist fight
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest
But there won't be no breathin' for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark
So chase the air hide your stash
Beware from [?] marks
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand


[Virginya Slim:]
Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, westside! What?! Bring it on!

[2Pac:]
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind

[2Pac:]
C'mon, our childhood years, recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smoking sherm, drinking malt liquor, father forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcising all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I could hardly wait
To bust freely, got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

[Virginya Slim:]
What?! I'm busting on you punk ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on your ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide when I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, west side!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

[2Pac:]
My girlfriend: blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothing compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, 'cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, dropping niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war; never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleeping with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waiting by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall; me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
I love finger-fucking you, all of a sudden I'm hearing thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be ducking or taking numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, begging for drama
While unleashing on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm asking for
Talking to me, begging me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy, you just wanna be down
Talking loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, busting rounds, activating a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you, break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend

[2Pac:]
Lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doing 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child, raised in this whirlwind
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Me and my girlfriend


"Street Science, you're on the air. What do you feel when you hear a record like 2Pac's new one?"
"I love 2Pac's new record."
"Right, but don't you feel like that creates tension between East and West? I mean, he's talking about killing people, 'I had sex with your wife' â and not in those words. But he's talking about, 'I wanna see you deceased'â¦"

[2Pac:]
To live and die in L.A., California
What you say about Los Angeles?
Still the only place for me
It never rains in Southern California

[2Pac:]
To live and die in L.A.
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
Who was a friend is now a ghost in the dark
Cold-hearted 'bout it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen
Making money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail

[Val Young (2Pac):]
(My angel sing)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(And the angels go)
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
(To live and die in L.A.)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[2Pac:]
It's the City of Angels and constant danger
South Central L.A. can't get no stranger
Full of drama, like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin' the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggas getting three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear, the pen right across from hell
I can't cry, 'cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women
'Cause every nigga in L.A. got a little bit of thug in him
We might fight amongst each other
But I promise you this: we'll burn this bitch down
Get us pissed, to live and die in L.A.

[Val Young (2Pac):]
(My angel sing)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(And the angels go)
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
(To live and die in L.A.)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see

[2Pac:]
It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, brown pride, and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember K-day? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love your hood!
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this mothafucka permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B.
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tray, Heron, Big Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A.

[Val Young (2Pac):]
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(Let my angel sing)
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
(And my angels go)
To live and die in L.A., it's the place to be
(To live and die in L.A.)
You've got to be there to know it
When everybody wanna see
(Let my angel sing)

[2Pac:]
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin' my shit
Makin' my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
This go out to all the magazines that support a nigga
All the real motherfuckers
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A&R people, all y'all mothafuckers
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)
L.A., "California Love" part mothafuckin' two
Without gay ass Dre
(To live and die in L.A., mhmmm)


[2Pac:]
The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got
My other Capo in this big-ass
Conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who's he coming through right now?
Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati

[2Pac:]
Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up

[Danny Boy:]
Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
Female I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on!

[Jojo:]
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby

[Danny Boy & JoJo:]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up

[Bridge:]
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on

[K-Ci:]
Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!

[Aaron Hall:]
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty titillating delight-ah
Back it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me

[K-Ci & Aaron Hall:]
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
So won't you play on

[2Pac:]
How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searching for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Laugh at you suckers cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming "Compton", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we Untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up

Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up
Let me see you toss it up

[2Pac:]
Yeah no doubt
Toss it up now
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up
And then want to do a player song?
(you so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed
We are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)
How can non-players do it? (you know who I'm talking bout)
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? Who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
It's on! Toss it up, we took you on
And we took y'all beat (toss it up)
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (toss it up now)
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now
Yeah, toss it up now!


You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall
You're not usin' your brain
That's what the white man wants you to do
Look at you, what makes you ashamed of bein black

[2Pac:]
Nothin' but love for you my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact that we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin'
In this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up or we messed up

[2Pac:]
Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison I miss ya
Cryin' lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya, kinda suspicious
Swearin' one day you might leave me, for somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologizes to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black Nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world - and all I heard was

Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In this world, where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

[2Pac:]
Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white manâs world.
All my ghetto motherfuckers be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little Black seeds, born Black in the White man'z world).
All these motherfuckers wanna be like us.
They all wanna be like us, to be the have naughts: all hail.
God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt

[2Pac:]
Bein' born with less, I must confess only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket gently askin', is there heaven for G's
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby momma be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son, finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama why we live so poor
Why you crying? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama? Why they keep on calling me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in his jail cell, missing my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black but why we act like we don't love ourselves
Don't look around busta (you sucka) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still struggling, in this white man's world

[2Pac:]
Who, knows what tomorrow brings
(Born black in this white man's world)
In this world, where everyone's blind?
(In this white man's world)
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
(In this white man's world)
To let you know, that you're not alone

[*megaphone*]
We must fight, for brother Mumia
We must fight, for brother Mutulu
And we must fight, for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight, for brother Geronimo Pratt
We must fight, for [?], Zulu, [?]
We must fight, for countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man

[2Pac:]
So tell me why you
Changed to choose a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die
Not gon' cry, why should I care
Like we holding on to lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me, God bless me please keep my seeds healthy
Making all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me with ammunitions, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven - ain't no G's in hell
Sister sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take - ended up bein fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see, that we under attack
I never meant to cause drama, to my sister and mama
Hope we make it, to better times, in this white man's world

Who, knows what tomorrow brings
In world, where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far I'll find
To let you know, that you're not alone

[Khalid Abdul Muhammad:]
"You're out of touch with reality!
There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms
Calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people
--White and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable-- are suffering in this nation."

[2Pac:]
Never that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time they ain't took us out
They can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein extinct
About us being endangered species, we ain't NEVER gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet, unless Y'ALL choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin' us it's US that's killin' us
It ain't them that's knockin' us off, it's US that's knockin' us off
I'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world
.. born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal
Sekou Odinga, all the real O.G.'s, we out

[Minister Farrakhan - Oct. 17, 1995:]
The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was, to be a nation by white people, and for white people
Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation


[Kastro (Napoleon):]
We goin' all out, we goin' all out
We goin' all out
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!
(That's right, fuck these fag niggas!)
Do it, do it, do it!

[2Pac:]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk, 'cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas, like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers, like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers
Quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin' caps at Jay Z
(Buck buck buck buck buck!) And still avoid capture
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica, sippin' daiquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin'
Then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas playa-hatin', got me crooked in all fifty states
I'm screamin', "Death Row!"
Throw my Westside, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-bys, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B., if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this: I'm hard to kill when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive these five shots?
Live it up or give it up, and like demons
Late night, hear them screamin', "We goin' all out!"

[E.D.I.:]
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

[Napoleon:]
I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
Feelin' like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
Outlawz, my blood brothers, I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm out in Jers, to the fullest, like some West Coast love
But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug
Just West Coast slut
To my real niggas stuck in the street game, 'cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin'? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
It's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!

[E.D.I.:]
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

[Kastro:]
Now, we all ride, and down to die; who with us?
Speak up, or get treated like you comin' to kill us
They ain't nothin' but squealers
In this rap game, swearin' they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac
Stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
These Glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out ya
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a OG, 'cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to thug lords, like them motherfuckers holy
Frontline soldier, 'til the Heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' 'bout, 'cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas they can't deal with
Holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it, what; we goin' all out, nigga!

[E.D.I.:]
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

[E.D.I.:]
Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt
Aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uh
Talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
And we ain't gon' say shit
Now it's 1999, it's a different grind
Don't disrespect the Don
It's still war, motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know


Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier

The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs, official mob figures
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be lost in my own mind
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' "Fuck the police!" as I ride through the night streets
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Singing + 2Pac:]
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyesâ¦

Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin', "Bloody murder, murder!"
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homie had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash; time to get 'em back
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me, what you want, Lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord
The situation's critical
Nothing is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

[Singing + 2Pac:]
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!
Who wanna see me in a challenge?
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan
One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' 60 years
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promise us is death, nigga
Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga
It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nuttin colder
Listen, you can hear it â the ballad of a dead soldier

[Singing + 2Pac:]
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

This go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku â all the down-ass riders
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle
(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)
All the niggas that passed on
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)
Tryin' to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell
('Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets, nigga
(Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know â it's the ballad of a dead soldier!


[2Pac:]
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me, nigga, tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?

[2Pac:]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[2Pac:]
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin' my death
All 50 seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah, nigga, I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block; call the cops
A thug nigga screamin', "Westside!", bustin' double Glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb
Hand on the steerin' wheel, swervin'
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets
âCause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck
Ridin' as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside, Outlaw; Bad Boy killer
Complete my mission, my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[2Pac:]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Young Noble:]
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone, we burnin' the Earth
Outlawz, worldwide, we packed the block
Shootin' rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me? Young Noble
Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me; I'm still breathin'

[Napoleon:]
Now, we was raised, "Fuck this life," my wrongs, my rights
Holdin' on a tight grip, with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleep walkin' as a true
Walk around town, with a pound full of bitter food
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag ass niggas, see-through-glass ass niggas
Only-ride-my-dick-and-the-skin-of-my-mash ass niggas

[2Pac:]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

[Kastro:]
I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin' 'bout a bad day; I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin' my hair, bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat, yo, I'm ruined, and
Breathin' in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that when I was still in Mommy
The side of the city that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast
That's where the fuck we come from; and still I'm breathin'!

[E.D.I. Mean:]
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r, one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one, motherfucker, 'bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time he drop, I know you fuckers losin' it
We movin' in, for the kill, for a meal, holdin' steel
Hold the wheel
I'm 'bout to give these niggas something they can feel
Fakin' real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin' thug lyin' niggas, give it up!
We hit 'em up

[E.D.I.:]
And we still breathin' and we still breathin'â¦
(Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?)

[2Pac:]
Tell 'em! Nigga, tell 'em! (And we still breathin'â¦)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?

[2Pac:]
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'


[2Pac]
Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)

[2Pac]
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

[2Pac]
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!
Psssh

[2Pac]
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, "Where is the quaaludes?" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed "Nigga motherfucker"
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
God damn!
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'


[2Pac:]
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo
Live from the graveyard
I don't wanna be your man, bitch, (fuck that) what you crazy
I don't wanna be your fuckin' man
You stupid you fuckin' idiot (drunk ho)
I wanna be
Yo let me fuck that nigga down
What's that?
Ay yo what you doin' with that big ass
My ghetto love song (hahaha)
Set it off, set it off
Let's be friends
Where my niggas at
Where my niggas, where my niggas
Where my niggas at, all my real niggas (throw your muthafuckin' hands up)
Where my niggas, where my niggas
Hahahaha yeah (lets go lets go)
Let's be friends (throw ya hands in the air)
There's no need to front (let's see ya just throw ya hands in the air)
Let's be friendsâ¦
(Westside in this motherfucker right here, Westside)
(throw ya hands in the air)

[2Pac:]
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps, baby? Come get with me and perhaps, lady
You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my rÃ©sumÃ©, sippin' on Cristal and Alize
Smokin' on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, read briefly, they're so cheap
Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called cum, who the man?
While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
Understand this: Ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay Z!
He broke and I smoke daily, baby, let's be friends

[Singer (2Pac):]
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? C'mon!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(All my niggas, where my hoes at?)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends! (Where the bitches at?
Where the niggas with money? Where you at, baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

[2Pac:]
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you
Hardcore, starin' and watchin'
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs
Now let me in between as friends

[Singer (2Pac):]
Let's be friends (Westside, motherfucker, right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(Westside in this motherfucker)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (Westside in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(In this motherfucker right here)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

[2Pac:]
Can you imagine me in player mode? Rush the tricks
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?
Bet I scream "Westside!" when I came (Westside!)
Scream my name 'cause, baby, it's delicious
Ghetto weak spot for pretty bitches up and down
Similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back [?] it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin' niggas, 'cause they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good, in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record, and let's be friends
Where my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at? Thug style!

[Singer (2Pac):]
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)
Friendsâ¦ (My ghetto love song!
It goes on and on and on and on)
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Where my niggas at?)
Friendsâ¦ (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
(Where my people at? Let's beâ¦)

[2Pac:]
Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
All my niggas now, just my niggas come!
Where my niggas at? Just my niggas now!
Be friends, tell me where my niggas at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Be friends, tell me where my people at
Be friends, tell me where my bitches at
Make money, take money, be friends

[Singer (2Pac):]
Let's be friends (Get your cash on! Let's get dough!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(C'mon, get your cash on!)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (C'mon, get your cash on! Let's get paid!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(C'mon, get your cash on!)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

[2Pac:]
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!


Niggas fuckin' with the wrong nigga

My seductive introduction be specific
Still elusive, but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted; niggas can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flippin' my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly
Niggas is swingin' wild, but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch, but your whole click will still get treated shitty
Business never personal
I'm up before the sun come up, I'm tired
Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'
Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, 'cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, 'cause Syke was bustin'
Plus, Bo had 'em duckin', screamin', "Get they cash!"
So now I got the law on me
My phone's tapped So I had to send word through my lil' homies
Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga

This is what you get
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Hehehehe, yeah, nigga, peep it

Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray and thank the Lord
For givin' me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me
All I can see is gettin' 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel; they caps peeled
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, hey
Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in Heaven
Why call in shots? Nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder, my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love
God, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
You know?

It's like, why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?

I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise, but they tried me
I guess they all had to die, 'cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some back-up
For lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
"Buck buck" was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
Should've never fucked around, buster
How you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga

It's what it sounds like, ding ding ding.
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Niggas gettin' hit, when they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga


[2Pac:]
I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

[2Pac:]
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust the hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
See, we live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

[Big Syke:]
No one knows what the, future holds, for you
Haha, listen closely
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. after livin' so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl - livin' the good life!

[2Pac:]
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
Uh ha, We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

[E.D.I.:]
I spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
Bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
We still tryin' to get a hold of the game
Livin' that good life

[2Pac:]
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't, uh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uh
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb bitches that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die


[2Pac:]
Home man, hey (what's up). Let's turn this house into a happy home
This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Let's turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Let's turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw, look

[2Pac:]
Now we've been kickin' it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm trying you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

[Singer (2Pac):]
Happy home. 
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 

[2Pac:]
Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

[Singer (2Pac):]
Happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 
(finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
Happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 
(Happy home)

[Singer (2Pac):]
All these problems got me going
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

[Singer (2Pac):]
Happy home. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 
(finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
Happy home 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Happy home. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home).
Happy home.
(Hey, haha, turn this house into a happy home)
(Long as one of us got it, some of us got it)
(Turn this house into a happy home)

All up in a nigga face, givin' me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace
A Gemini, so you really blow my mind freak, come on

And all down the line, let's get busy


To my unborn childâ¦
To my unborn child
In case I don't make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

Now ever since my birth
I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin', I'm reminiscin'
To the beginning of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther: loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
'Cause my mama say I'm good for nothing, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure getting better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

[Natasha Walker:]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Want to let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
'Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand till we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for being anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I got to die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

[Natasha Walker:]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Want to let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
'Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Dear Lord, can you hear me? Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
'Cause being black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Living my life as an Outlaw â what could be worse?
'Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kidding? I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not being there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, resting in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn childâ¦
This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see 'cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothing but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you if there's a ghetto in Heaven
If there's a ghetto Heaven, I'll be there waiting for you
Heh heh, take care. Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there's confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it
All day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime a dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody


Fuckin' lil' homiesâ¦
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homiesâ¦
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

Just pay attention; here's a story 'bout my lil' homies
Straight thuggin', lil' bad young motherfuckers
Gotta love 'em, you could catch him in his G ride, clutchin' his Glock
Screamin', "Outlaw!" (West Side motherfucker!), bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin' money, makin' dummies out the police
Ain't no peace, for an adolescent nigga too wild, to be a thinker
Bud smokin' 24/7, everyday drinker
Got my diploma, but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder, fool!
Always the young niggas gettin' in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate, so you called her a bitch (biatch!)
Bustin' on paper thin motherfuckers
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them busters
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets

I remember, when you was just a lil' G, flirtin' with death
Playin' "Russian Roulette", screamin', "Kill me!"
Hey there, young nigga, what you smokin' on?
Mad at the world 'cause you came from a broken home?
Love the squad, plus your mob is sick
A bunch of adolescent niggas spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga, if you die, let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin' as your mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggas on a mission to compete
Gettin' G's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
And unloaded on the whole front row (BUCK! BUCK!, BUCK BUCK)
Try to tell him, but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and he show me; my lil' homie

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homie)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets

"First 2 Bomb", "16 On Death Row"
Bustin' on them phony motherfuckers
'Cause the big homie said so
Niggas knew I was a nutcase, quick to blast
Livin' underage, but he'll blaze on your bitch-ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace
Shell-shocked souls makin' money off of crack sales, young black male!
Unable to change, 'cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K. Kastro
Big Malcom, Hussein, call 'em Outlawz
Tellin' the world to be equipped
When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pulled a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me; my lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
'Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash..

[2Pac:]

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[2Pac:]
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggas in Penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

[2Pac:]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches (keep it money over bitches)
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[Hussein Fatal:]
I blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me, I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

[2Pac:]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[Mopreme:]
My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo, and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra, with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em
Stackin' G's, my niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies
Money over bitches
(Nigga!)

[2Pac:]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[Big Syke:]
I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contrited to strive never laggin'
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a, fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

[2Pac:]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

[Yaki Kadafi:]
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin', I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a Glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

[2Pac:]
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks

That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin' bitches

Keep your motherfuckin' mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin' bitches
You need some motherfuckin' money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here.
BIATCH!


[2Pac (Hussein Fatal):]
(Mr. If you a bad boy)
Yo, what's up
The police comin' on, oh shit! Get out of there.
Fatal, Outlawz I wanna up out this motherfucker
Gon' pass it
Ain't get me up but fuck that
This Outlaw nigga

[2Pac:]
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep

[Hussein Fatal:]
I focus my locus thought on the enemies
Sip off the Hennessy, it's necessary to finish me
I'm antisocial immortal, when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas down, they won't broke 'em 'til it's time to smoke 'em
Hussein the terrorist
Dig they think I'm crazy and [?]
And as we speak they tryin' to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire 'til you die a liar
Strap in the city corners droppin' on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Military camaraderie, outlaw 'til they body me
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin' at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep, you try to bust me 'til death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

[2Pac:]
Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we strapped
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'

Hey where that nigga

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Halfway thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
Sort of like [?] and narcotics when they walk the beat
You speak the beef pussy draw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
Blocks pop with 22's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
You never seen time I travel across dream crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded with green slime
With my foes erased drink my Henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like Haitian 5 minutes from the station

[Young Noble:]
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
No finger prints don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
Money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bowin' on your knees shit
The Glock to your head nigga, don't make no somethin' action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted, dump fuckin' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life and g-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Or cage me in, crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like them niggas on Fabian
Havin' the fiend page me (page me)
When they want the product, nigga I got to smoke
Got this weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you workin' with? I'm on some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin' shit, use artillery to murder with
Put on the block gangsta party and like 'Pac
Life's hard from the ox me and my niggas on top (party)

[2Pac:]
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E

[Nuttso:]
With my Glock, quick to let it pop, fuck the law
Carry steel cause I live on the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin'
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin'
Ridin' high, blazin', kryptonite got a nigga dazin'
Burpin' and smurkin' got on enemies before I grave 'em
Ride 'em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
Had to stop light in a slowly night, this motherfuckin' trick
Slide over so I can dump and put it in em
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speedin'
With the metal tryin' to make these motherfuckers die speedin'
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit! I think I done bucked these hoes down
Caught them runnin' on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin' with me but they dumb to see

[2Pac:]
Open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
Plus all them trick niggas basically can go to hell with 'em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words are known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
A crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
Out on bail, raised in hell, nigga fuck what you thought
Did you cry when my girl died?
Put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
Iâll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
Kamikaze, Iâm shootin' up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piÃ±ata and party
His last breath, a straight lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E.
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E

[2Pac talking:]
One time, one time for the niggas that stayed down for us
Runnin' on E
Smif-n-Wessun the Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot, BDI, runnin' on E
The Bootcamp Click
What happened, that was it?


[2Pac:]
Ay come on JoJo ('Pac, hahaha)
Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)

[2Pac:]
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
and if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
but do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me
So whatchu sayin' girl?

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna put in you (maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

[2Pac:]
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin'
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin' (haha)
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna put in you (maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

[2Pac:]
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it? Oh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to cum
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
to get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna put in you and you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me
That I wanna put in you and you (Maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl

[Singing:]
Gotta be a thug in ya (thug in me)
A little bit of thug in me, a little bit of thug in ya
A little bit of thug in me
I hold a lot of thug in me, you hold a lot of thug in ya
I hold a lot of thug in me
I hold a lot of thug in me, I hold a lot of thug in ya
I hold a lot of thug in me
Now c'mon, I hold a lot of thug in me
Hold a lot of thug in you, hold a lot of thug in me
C'mon, hold a lot of thug in me
Gotta be some thug in ya, gotta be some thug in me
C'mon, hold a lot of thug in me
I gotta be some thug in ya
Can you feel it?
I hold a lot of thug in me, I gotta be some thug in ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do you want it?
I hold a lot of thug in me, feel like some thug in ya

[Collision over singing:]
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations
I don't got no motherfuckin' explanations, y'knahmsayin?
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin' why I'm pullin' your hair
And why I fuck so motherfuckin' thuggish
That thug passion, y'knahmean?
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of? Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be
Strokin', and all that bullshit
You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, "2Pac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over! Maybe it's the thug in me!


[2Pac:]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
'Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her "Yeah," but it's clear
I'll always be the same; until the end of time

[R.L. Huggar:]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[2Pac:]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night money making got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smoking 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of timeâ¦

[R.L. Huggar:]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

[2Pac:]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinking Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a g
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about, more
Getting raw 'til the day I see my casket, buried as a G
While the whole world remembers me, until the end of time

[R.L. Huggar:]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time


[2Pac:]
As the world turnsâ¦
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turnsâ¦

[2Pac:]
Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change 
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mob, M.O.B
Killin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turnsâ¦

[Darryl 'Big D' Harper (2Pac):]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns, and steady turnin'
(Turns, turns, turns, turns and turns
My niggas grow and grow and grow
And gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
From this cell to that cell, as the world turns)

[Young Noble:]
As the world turn, burnin' paths, starin' through my rearview
It's a war goin' on, and the President is here too
I hear 2Pac sayin', "Watch 'em, they'll kill you."
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin' like he feel you
Steady plottin', ready or not; Outlawz lost but not forgotten
From Gittere to Compton, a spitter of the hotness
Long time, since like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlaw!

[Napoleon:]
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gauge pump, with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks!
Road rules, I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli, the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi better unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin', we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve 'em, like 'Pac told us to, catch 'em wreck with the TEC
Hit 'em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon: the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mighty dollar, rather drunk than sober
Nigga talkin' thug walkin' all through yo' squad
Y'all niggas scared by a dog, I got my 44 for y'all
It's like a hot-heated day, homie
Warfare, don't play, homie, better be prepared
Then try to duck away from these strays, homie
Worlds turn, things burn, all in one shot. Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got, as the world turnsâ¦

[Darryl 'Big D' Harper (2Pac):]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
(And my niggas roll and ride, hahaha)
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turnsâ¦ and steady turnin'
(Niggas gettin' swoll out, and it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit!) (real shit)
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
(How many you niggas try for this? )
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns (as the world turns)
(Murderin' methods.. haha, OUTLAW!)

[E.D.I. Amin:]
Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas â mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn

[Kadafi:]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

[Overlapped â Darryl 'Big D' Harper:]
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turnsâ¦ and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turnsâ¦
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turns...
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
It's gon' be goin' round as the world turnsâ¦ and steady turnin'
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
As the world keeps turnin' round and round
As the world keeps turnin' round and round

[2Pac & Napolean:]
Hahahaâ¦ as the world turnsâ¦
And turns and turns and turnsâ¦ haha. This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin' to bubble, keep on hustlin', as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go, friends come and goâ¦ my soldiers stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggas gettin chin checked
From the East to the West, best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you!
As the world turnsâ¦ Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns, hahaâ¦ burn, baby, burn

(A lot of niggas get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggas gettin' burned as the world turns
Gettin' burned as the world turns)


[2Pac (H.E.A.T.):]
I feel you (uh), baby don't
But you can't, you can't give up
H.E.A.T., 2Pac with Outlawz!

[2Pac (H.E.A.T.):]
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up (Outlawz)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (Keep ya head up)

[2Pac:]
Now here's a story 'bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at 13, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin' quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"What would you do if it was you?"

Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggas grabbin' me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord, come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin' with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

[2Pac (H.E.A.T.):]
Baby please don't cry! You got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cry! You got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! I hope you got yo' head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
Baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
Baby don't cryâ¦

[E.D.I. Amin:]
Forget him, girl, he ain't gon' never change
I ain't no hater but that nigga lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
He probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin' mo'
And never your feelings, he's chasin' millions for sho'
Uh oh, now you 'bout to have his baby?
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much mo' livin' to do â I'm spittin' this to you
'Cause you deserve more than what he givin' to you
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
Got 'em all stuck standin' still when she come through
Baby, take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And sho' as the sky's blue somebody other than me
Gon' give you everythin' you need, feel me? (Don't cry-ahâ¦)

[2Pac (H.E.A.T.):]
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! You got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! You got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (you'll be alright)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (keep ya head up)
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! I hope you got your head up (never give up)
Even when the road is hard, never give up! (no no... oh)
Baby don't cryâ¦

[Young Noble:]
I'm tryin' to do all that I can
From jump, now you losin', you was choosin' the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you?
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin' to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homie roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those ain't my seeds, nothin' really I could do
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Should've chose me, she 'bout to OD from the pressure
Hell nah, I won't let her (BABY..)

[2Pac (H.E.A.T.):]
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! You got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up!
(Baby don't cry!) baby don't cry! You got to keep your head up

Baby don't cry

[E.D.I. Amin:]
For all the ladies (Soulshock, Karlin)
Baby don't cry! Got to keep your head up
(Keep your head up)
Makaveli lives on (head up) aight?


[2Pac (Kadafi):]
Searchin' for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin' jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
You can be Christian
Straight tatted up
(Straight Jehovah witness)
No doubt
(Islamic)
No doubt man
(Me, I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga.
What?

[Kadafi:]
I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards 
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stash more greenGods; they ain't tryin' to be trapped
On no block slangin' no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps

[Storm:]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

[2Pac:]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Young Noble:]
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin' against the system, commence to lynchin'
The President ain't even listenin' to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin' us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus

[2Pac:]
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wishes niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin' the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

[2Pac:]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

[Kastro:]
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searchin' for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin'... Jesus

[Background overlapped singing:]
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!

[Kastro:]
Searchin' for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchin' for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we comin' from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all


Get on yo knees nigga, get on yo knees and pray

[2Pac:]
Increase the doses, bust on whoever closest
Thug livin', hell of prison, never losin' my focus
I'm makin' money moves mandatory, end of discussion
My past records tell a story, picture niggas with rushin'
And still bustin', 'til the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin' my gun, homeboy the motherfuckin' villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legitly
So I laugh til I'm cryin', when the Lord come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga missed me
Why plant seeds in a dirty bitch waitin' to trick me
Not the life for me, livin' carefree 'til I'm buried
And if they dare me, I'll bust on them niggas, and until they scurry
I'm clearly a man of military means, to my artillery
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin' dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past in vain
Never knowin' if this game will last, feelin' the shame
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin' my soul
Got tired of small time livin' nigga tellin' me no
I got mine, fuck them other suckas
That's the mentality, jealous ass bustas make it hell for a hustler

[2Pac & Yaki Kadafi:]
Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[Edi Mean:]
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein' broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay strugglin' and jugglin' with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? "all" is for lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin' you soft niggas is outta here
In case you forgot we on the same shit that got us here

[Young Noble:]
Yo, to e'ry step I take, e'ry sell I make
E'ry jail I break, e'ry mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin' charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin' dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
for all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dyin' luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin' cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[2Pac:]
No insanity plea from me, I ride the beef 'til I burn
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile, guess you can recall me antisocial
Niggas shakin' like they caught the Holy Ghost when I approach
Try to politic before I smoke 'em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comin' for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Gettin' blowed out
High watch me murder the bird before he testify
Strikes walkin' close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream, be a part of my team from Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustas
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell for a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways (Lord!)
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (help me change my ways)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler (why I was raised this way?)
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on Judgment day (on a judgement days)
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta, make it Hell 4 a hustler

[2Pac:]
This is how we ride not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild 'til they all die
This is how we ride not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, Iâm the first to break wild until they all die, outlaw
Yes, change my ways yes, the Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary, aight, only God can save us


[E.D.I. Amin:]
High speed
For all my niggas livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright

[2Pac (E.D.I. Amin):]
Life at high speed, life at high speed
Fuck the punishment, Thai weed
(Buy me a gun), liquor and puffin' Thai weed

[2Pac:]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly
Harm me, my army
Niggas decease swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna act out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon that'll blow yo muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred
Deep questions for the lord "Why he don't like me, god?"
So, though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb all lessons, provide protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double R, rugged and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, we crooked, be mistaken for Jewels
We all about our cash, blast if you break the rules
Fools turned snitch for the D.A., be heaven-sent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned state's evidence, why?
Then they wonder why niggas die
Put your family in danger, just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime trade, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all the mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin' blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic or Thai weed
Puffin' through this high speed
And people say...

[2Pac:]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
Hot plastic stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to split ya
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's softer than tissue
I ride by like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof (yeah)
Give me the joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Rapid shots pourin'
Catchin' niggas while they snorin'
Kickin' his door in
I'll leave your whole fuckin' family in mournin'
Bust me, you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like you're hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel

[2Pac:]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun

Food and sex, house parties in the projects

Food and sex, house parties in the projects

[E.D.I. Amin:]
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on passin', pushin' me into danger
No stranger to hard times or the good ones
At times I'm amazed
At what the motherfuckin' hoods done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals and values and dust more
Niggas is dying tomorrow
We, bailing on borrowed times
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you gonna need money or Glocks spittin'
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't know what
Soon that money gon' be illegal when you die to
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you "what?" to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like y'all, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Let's get blowed out high speed 'til the end of my days
Now my people say

[2Pac:]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun

(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)
From Compton to Jersey

Outlawz with that rough shit, baby!

[E.D.I. Amin:]
Learn about it
Pac you goin' rap?


[2Pac:]
Oh shit, caught that nigga alone. Ain't that a bitch?
Hey, uh, this one here is, uh for them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin' 50 deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin' about
You know who I'm talkin' about, that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[2Pac:]
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys

[2Pac:]
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboys you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks
You ain't shit without your homeboys, nigga
(Punk ass.. that's right motherfucker)
You ain't shit without your homeboys
(Throw your hands up you little trick)
(a squared.. coward motherfucker)

[Young Noble:]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks?
When you got the Outlaw Pac shittin' your box
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga 30 deep, oh, you wanna beef?
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it â what's this? You the only scared one
Damn, son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fists, I would have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different when they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned 
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget, Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys?

[2Pac:]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers (without your homboys)
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
(You know what time it is)
I ain't shit without my homeboys
(Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga)

[2Pac:]
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back. Until I die, they label me as a ridah forever, my niggas be together

Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys
The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my niggas to death
I ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys


[2Pac:]
Makaveli the Don, break on 'em!
Ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
Hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, handâ¦

[2Pac:]
Let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's goon
Around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Niggas is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggas cross me, I'm certified crazy
So sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride is for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
Label me a threat and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
I'm a ridah, every nigga breathin' pay attention
'Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
A simple glimpse of my lifestyle, Killuminatiâ¦

[(Kastro) 2Pac:]
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)

[2Pac:]
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
Itâs like Iâm - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 45, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

[(Kastro) 2Pac:]
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)

[E.D.I. Amin:]
I spend most of my time bankin', niggas
Because they hate a nigga, comin' across fake niggas
But we made niggas, old school and I'm thinkin'
Y'all some bitch made niggas and you steadily sinkin'
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z, ain't nothing fuckin' with that
We bustin' back, comin' back for the stacks
Laugh last, cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin' them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill, steal and peal quickly
The boss niggas, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill 'em all for shorty, '99 Killuminati

[Kadafi:]
They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustling's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
Tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is rolling three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back, rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
It hurts, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's, sippin' naughty thangs
Real as these tats on my body, and it's Killuminati

[E.D.I. (2Pac):]
Uh, dear Mr. President. What's happenin'?
I'm writin' you because
Shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way
Right around the time when you got electedâ¦
Ain't nothin' changed. All the promises you made, before you got electedâ¦ they ain't came true
(Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)
(Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President)
Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin' onâ¦ holla!
(Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up in the hood)
(Send mo' troopsâ¦)

[2Pac:]
Why should I lie when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I've been blessed given riches
Enemies suspicious cuz I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict so visual that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination: Death Row â finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die; call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us
Sincerely yours, I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga, what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know I let my pump go
Get it ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President

[2Pac:]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

[E.D.I. Amin:]
Oh you's a baller in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo', I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
[?], leave a nigga flat for scratch
The Godless, I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? - Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing nigga pay the paper besides smoke and work
On a mission, listen [?] with precision
First made my decision, I realized this ain't livin'
Trippin' to drastic measures, tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Motherfuckers hate cops, wait, it ain't gettin' better
But you keep tellin' us that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids
Dig, don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin' with nothing but artillery to free us, motherfucker

[E.D.I. Amin:]
Dear Mr. President, tell us what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops

[Kastro:]
Strapped and angry, with no hope, and heart-broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the Glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggler out the gutter, 22 with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
'Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's will freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven-sent
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Shit is still fucked up, y'all. And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better, and it ain't gon' get better

[2Pac:]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' upâ¦

[2Pac:]
Heavenly Father, may I holla at you briefly?
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
Is he scared to look inside the eyes of a thug nigga?
We tired of being scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, 13 lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin', "Let him die!"
Can't lie, I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die for everything I represent
Meant every word in my letter to the President

[Big Syke:]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
'Til then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

[2Pac:]
Word motherfuckin' life, what the fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?!
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin' scout
Nigga, this Thug Life, Westside, Outlaw Immortalz
Nigga, we finna hustle 'til we come up

[2Pac:]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do

[2Pac:]
Dear Mr. Clinton, shit (send mo' troops)â¦ it's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit (send mo' troops), I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
'Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece (send mo' troops)
I know you fear me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out? (send mo' troops)
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care? (send mo' troops)
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars (send mo' troops)
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool? (send mo' troops)
We ain't stupid, think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops (send mo' troops)
You want us to fight your war, what the fuck I'm fightin' for? (send mo' troops)
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year, taxin' all the blacks (send mo' troops)
Police beatin' me in the streetsâ¦ fuck peace!
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops..troops..troops..troops!


[E.D.I. Amin:]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[E.D.I. Amin:]
War time, war time, it's either yours or mine
Outlawz be on the grind and a mission to shine
And ride on 'em, leave 'em stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate, with a bomb I'm about to detonate
Boom! Hesitate? Aww, now you know what
Ya'll niggas were here to go if you know it was good for ya
Bunch of toy soldiers all dressed in fatigue
But I'm E.D.I. Amin on a mission to make 'em bleed
Nigga what? Nigga who? It was cool? And at you?
What the fuck is you gonna do? Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money, all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga slippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine, but when you could do yours
We'll bring these motherfuckers war

[E.D.I. Amin:]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[2Pac:]
As I approach the scene
From smokin' green got my eyes closed
Niggas so cold on my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord, help me with it
Got me paintin' pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for options, but the pressures nonstop
Niggas get the pistol poppin' and watch his body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set, flash on
Blast on them bitch-made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' "Westside!" you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons, hittin' weed, got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas pass the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
Got some shit that they ain't ready for: I got the secrets of war

[E.D.I. Amin:]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Yaki Kadafi:]
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, stick 'em
Down with no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his motherfuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streets is black hockey and raw, we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar, locked in the slammer, while I'm laid cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times 'bout up, y'all
That means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gon' do?

[E.D.I. Amin:]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[Young Noble:]
Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Get blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist 'em. Fuck the whole world, it's us against them
You got some heat? Pull it out, cock the hammer if you with it
Don't make no difference here with the 25-to-life sentence
We already doin' life on the streets
Like Al G., niggas be heated when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggas like Rodney
Turn a killer like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me

[E.D.I. Amin:]
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Look it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
Man it's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us or collide wit' us
See it's as simple as that for me and my niggas

[2Pac (E.D.I.):]
(Bring it on), and all you lil' young ass soldiers
You play this shit back about 15 times (talk about it)
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin' (e'ry body tough)
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin'
You know what I mean? Secrets of muthafuckin' warâ¦


[Kastro]
Dear Lord, as we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go, the only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

[2Pac]
Somebody wake me, I'm dreamin'
I started as a seed, the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
On the top was my pops, my mama screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples, but my papa was a loser
Only plan he had for mama was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be? A product of this heated passion
Mama got pregnant and papa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
"Will a nigga live or die?" cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryna hustle on my own
On the spot where everybody and they pops tryna slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man, he's a mind reader
Keep my 9 heater all the time, this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out
Pass the weed, nigga! That Hennessey'll keep me keyed, nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, "Keep it real, G"
And my reply 'til they kill me: "Act up if you feel me!"
I was born not to make it, but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

[Ta'He]
Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry

[Yaki Kadafi]
I stay sharp as always
Runnin' your bricks with blitz, through your project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish, full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams, it seems though
Be placin' triple beams and things, bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

[Napoleon]
Now I plan to keep my Glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me, then why not?
Show 'em what I'm made of, plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street
Thugs snatchin' bags, we out for power, makin' cash
It wasn't fast, it'll make me mad, I'm just like him
My homie on the corner with his gat tucked in
Youngins, they buckin' somethin'
The life he lead's the life he don't need, don't we all know?
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

[Young Noble]
Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
And still I rise, now I float, cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
Clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms 'til the sun came
My homie Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only 10 learn to duck cops

[Yaki Kadafi]
In '96 my Glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' your cap backwards
You cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' your spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
And still I rise, and still I riseâ¦

[Ta'He]
Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry
Still I (still I), I rise (I rise), please, give me to the sky (to the sky)
And if (and if), I die (I die), I don't want you to cry

Y'all niggas fake, all day everyday
So now I got roller blades, bitch
Thought you knew
Your mouth is rich
C'mon pops, let's go!


[2Pac:]
Live back at 'cha Westside baby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard "All Eyez on Me," niggas know what time it is
(Makaveli the Don) 'Pac do it like that
Rhyming and stealing, selling five million
(Outlaw... ninety-nine)
Fresh out on bail, niggas still can't see me
(Napoleon, E.D.I, Young Noble, Fatal Hussein)
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin' plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, Outlaw - Outlaw)
Competition, so they say, these niggas is gay
(Outlaw - Outlaw)
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walking and rapping
Heard of some niggas on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
(Throw ya motherfuckin' hands up)

I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears

Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll 
Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fucking mo', expound tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltrating; my military mind 
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash making
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
To become a man, we shedding tattooed tears

[2Pac + Young Noble:]
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handle stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)

I been, handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears

[2Pac:] Thugged out baby!

[Young Noble:]
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?

Yo, criminal ways of thinking made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinking caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years shedding tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feuding for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller

[Napoleon:]
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexing
Po-po's guessing if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears

I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears

[Kadafi:]
Shit... ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein' my opportunities through these bars of hell while getting high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes 
To get that cream and thangs while living this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me institutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holding down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

[Kastro:]
Yo I been losing sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowing now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of struggling, guzzling beers
Beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talking to the heavens
Walking through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, starting with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
I'mma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, crying these tattooed tears
Come on...

I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears; now, I
Said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been handling stress in this shit for years
Blazed out shedding tattooed tears


(hahhh, hahaha) Hehehe, word
It's like all we got left â teardrops and closed caskets
(Throw it up, fool! Hey, nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel, homie

[2Pac (Outlawz):]
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (Penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin' bigger
Just another wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) WHAT?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they Glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin' so they kept goin'
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars
(Will they survive? Two semi-automatic 9's)
(them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries)
(It's like they celebrate to death and wish they could die)
So peep the lesson, but wait a minute, back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
Teardrops and closed caskets

[Nate Dogg (2Pac w/ Outlawz):]
Will I... forever be... alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)..
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I... forever be... alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)

[2Pac (Outlawz):]
(Don't let these ghetto streets get you), Precious
(was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
Hopping God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin' bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
(Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love)
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely, while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
(She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo)
The neighborhood's buzzin', now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man (and his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin', a man with no feelings
(Teardrops and closed caskets)

[Nate Dogg (2Pac w/ Outlawz):]
Will I... forever be... alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
(Bury you dead and look ahead)
(a man with no feelings)
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I... forever be... alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)

[Outlawz:]
Now with the problems of poverty and the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die? How many'll live to tell?
Although best friends before, Lil' Trigga and Mo
They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

[2Pac:]
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick
Now he's played out

[2Pac (Outlawz):]
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious, too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad? (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They opened fire, three bodies dropped, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg â teardrops and closed caskets)

[Nate Dogg (2Pac w/ Outlawz):]
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?
(Teardrops and closed caskets)
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?
Will I.. forever be.. alone!?

[2Pac:]
Aye, QDIII in this motherfucker
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day
(rest in peace)
Yaknahmean? I know it's hard out there, heheh
With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin', funerals
Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits, homie
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do something y'all
We gon' have to do something
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seeing the same thing (rest in peace)
I send this out to Mutulu and Geronimo
And to all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
(to the homie Boonie, rest in peace, nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
In a thug nigga's heart forever (that's right)
Rest in peace, nigga
May your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece


[2Pac:]
These some hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin', planes fallin' from the sky
Murder, the good die young
Hahaha, the good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin' 
To help you get through the day
If it could

[2Pac:]
It was more than a tragedy, emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky, we tryna figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God, who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS 'til it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans, listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions, we should leave them a choice
Cause who we to say who lives and die, breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives needs to stop
What are we livin' for, givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned cause Pat Buchanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war but can't feed me
It's so easy to regret thangs after they done
Babies catchin' murder cases scared to laugh in the Sun
The tragedies that we all need, love in doses
In times like these we feel closest the good die young

Does anybody have an answer why
(it times like these we feel closest)
It seems the good die young (the good die young)
Can anybody tell me why
(rest in peace, god bless the dead, and we carry on huh)
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why (I ain't Quincy Jones)
It seems the good die young
(the good die young)
Does anybody tell me why
(Now we hear from the future, the next generation, tell me)
Does anybody tell me why

[Napolean:]
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse, cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin' turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did, so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin' like a star
And this murder got me feelin' like my death ain't far
And the land of stolen cars, don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms and my, father
So tell me somethin'
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny uhaha
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you

[Young Noble:]
Which is worst, first Storm and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Regrey Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo, Mom, Duke and Nu
From jump you kept it true
Helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja

Does anybody have an answer why (answer why)
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why (tell me why!)
Can anybody tell me why

[Kastro:]
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analyze these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we managed
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged they hate
How come!, someone explain "why the good die young"
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Days go past and as they pass, time move, quicker
No time for wastin', put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers ain't ridin' 4-3 felony's
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitalize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stand me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see (plain to see)
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sure to be dumb
And we'll all see exactly why the goods die young
(We ain't lyin' man)

Does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
It seems the good die young (tell me why)
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)
Does anybody have an answer why (tell me why)
It seems the good die young (die young)
Can anybody tell me why (tell me why)
Can anybody tell me why
(the good die young)

[2Pac:]
I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
I'll catch ya at the crossroads
The good die young

This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids that died innocent
That died young
At Columbine High
Rest in Peace (Oklahoma)
Outlawz
(Lil' yummy Sandifer
Tasha Harlins, all them
All the fallen kids
The dead babies
The closed caskets)


[Napoleon talking:]
Lifeâ¦ What the fuck is life for niggas like us?
Been wakin' up to another muthafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier
A nigga that seen everything in my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my parents get killed to my mothafuckin' eyes
I seen my brother kill himself in my eyes
I seen 'Pac, Yak die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched, you know what I mean?

[Napoleon:]
Oh God, forgive me, somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents, but they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who believe me or was I dreamin'?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm livin' blind, writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
And if we die, let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a young thug cry
They seein' us inside a casket, that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
They leavin' us inside this hell-hole
Just waitin' to fail, so then they tell us that's what jail fo'
Adolescent young teens turned violent
It's floatin', in a world turned silent, cuz you could be touched

[2Pac:]
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still live a child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still live a child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down cause you can be touched

[E.D.I.:]
I live life high speed, movin' a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny, makin' decisions carelessly
Yeah, it's me, yo' nigga man child
Bomb first, stand proud, ain't lookin' for hand-outs
25 years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leavin' rich and leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit, you can be touched
I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get more so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go I pray the Lord hold me

[Kastro:]
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga, Lonnie just got hit with 10
10 years for trustin' a friend, they left him stuck in the Pen'
I love him, we all here just to die here
Plus, nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched, by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways, so forever it's on, baby

[2Pac:]
My young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still live a child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down cause you can be touched
Young niggas in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile, still live a child life
Thinkin' he can make his pay, too in a rush
Niggas better slow down cause you can be touched

[Young Noble:]
Why grieve this life, planted by the fiends and pipes?
Green lights so I'm seein'-seein' everything twice
Pretty much of nothin' nice, we suckin' it up
Even when we get a job, we fuckin' it up
Like it can't happen to us, I could never be a bum
Yeah, right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep livin' it up
Look and learn, next it could be your turnâ¦ word

[Kadafi:]
Yes, this a felonies' hobby that got me here, thinkin' robbery
Day to day all year long, Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supportin' me
So in these streets of hockey I play the goalie
Secrets of war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies 
Remember what Pacino told me
Before he past, watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong, and it's survival of the strong
Livin' outside the laws of this crooked world I was born
Touchedâ¦

[2Pac:]
My young niggas in the wild life

[Young Noble:]
Yo, I can see, that you obviously, don't know me
Or my homies We O-U-T Lawz, fuck the phonies
A wise hustler once told me
"It's on you", though in his dreams when he first told me
Now it's true, I got love for you
Only to a certain extinct, niggas ain't worth shit
Cops and ride dick permits
I heard this and heard that about them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot, some of them soldiers fell off
Fuck y'all now everybody tied to us
Hollerin' out a nigga name, but never said what up
That shit critical, despicable, unforgivable
[?] like I blew yo' own, fan won't remember you
Thuggin' but we still spiritual, clear lyrical
I'm like the fuckin' Deff Squad, my ears ain't hearin' y'all
Pump fearin' y'all, but damn I ain't even wantin' to scare y'all
Listen to what I tell y'all, fuck the world
Your baby moms, and your baby girl
You muthafuckas so fake, yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin' the degree
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
Thug niggas

[Young Noble:]
We, will never, fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

[Napoleon:]
Now I've been trapped down, and fucked from day one
This indestructible style of mine, ain't no fun
Where I'm from, you sure to see about 10 niggas in a bedroom
Eatin' off the same spoon, sweepin' with the same broom
It's hazard, if you don't want yo life, well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone, with a Glock-nine young marriage
It's critical
Then one of them sat down livin' so mystical
And influenced with a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
Straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right into yo' wrong, I'll put the good to yo' evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife
And I'm the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that? Respect this
I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart, and I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 
We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades, me and my soul death astrayed
I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be fryin' you, cause y'all don't know me

[Young Noble:]
We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers

[E.D.I.:]
When we was kids, the lovin' felt good
But of course have the respect, though it's even better
Now for this chedder, niggas is layin' deader
Then Malcom and Martin, put together
Oh Lord only knows, where we'll end up
Remember
'Pac said: Watch the fuckin' signs
But we wasn't listenin', too busy tripping off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro, may we all roll
And if you don't know, we got the rap game petro
Scared cause we 'bout to release, like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground, we runnin' the ghettos
Stealin' all of ya fan base, like we kleptos
Bitch I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And niggas is stealin' my shit, and bustin' it wrong
Hot shots holla back, when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system
Military wisdom, preparin' myself for Armageddon
Breakin' my balls at this game, knowin' it's a dead end
And my only weapon is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah, we the muthafuckas you niggas is liery off
Controlling my steam, knowin' my team, to serve more
Fuck the reframe, stick to the game and earn more
Holdin' my head, rollin' the head with focus
Laughin' inside, cause deep inside, y'all don't know us

[Young Noble:]
We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us
We will never fall (Never)
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

[E.D.I. talking:]
Ain't never know niggas like us boy
They don't make niggas like us no more
Thug in Peace... to all my niggas (Never)
See ya soon... uh


Lookin' for these better days
Better days, hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons
Addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops
The only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried
Plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
That in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang
With the brothers I grew up with
Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I; I can't take her to the places she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin'
Lookin' for them better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey, better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!


[2Pac:]
Ahahha all my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down (never)
Ahahah yeah! My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Uh, yeah! My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Westside, westside
Part two of the war 

[2Pac:]
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
My last foe flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch them, mimickin' my style tryin' to walk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me 
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelings

Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelings

Yeah, Napoleon!

[Napoleon:]
Picture me sippin' on 1-5-1
Drunk than a motherfucker droppin' my gun
Or high as a kite hittin' hoes for fun
But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
And that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I, shoot you better hide nigga, chute is near
And you know just as well I do 
You ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble, but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
Holla "let's hit", we gon' taste the power
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question when we die together
Cause the hour soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun
Bring it 

Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town

[EDI-Mean:]
We yellin' "M-A-D-E N-I-double G-As
Motherfuckas, and we here to stay
From curb surfin', we workin' the industry, you kiddin' me
It's really nothing to me and my king, you see
We in the big things, eat a dick man, if you're hatin'
We're gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off, pay attention
Screamin' "Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound"
Ride or die niggas, and we huntin' you down
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Bangin' out with the po-po, tryin' to get to some more
Street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
Ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll a rock
That's the world with feelings, this a man's world youngin
The bitches in business, so learn a little something
Hey, stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelings

Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catchin' feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down 
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town 
Catchin' feelings

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Everybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
And the streets ain't got nothing for me but a hearse
I can't trust the church or the mobs, I can only trust God
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride 
I only roll with the real 
Cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed

Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town

Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound

Catchin' feelings


[2Pac:]
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

[2Pac:]
By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon
Niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a ballin' cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

[JohntÃ¡ Austin (2Pac):]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

[T.I.:]
In drop top, the Glock cocked
Got rocks in my socks Cops
Spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
Not if they got niggas, dough boys and hot niggas
Who mighta shot niggas but only by skrilla
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashing past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalate back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I.P. and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggas here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

[JohntÃ¡ Austin (2Pac):]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
You fuckin' with a changed man

[2Pac:]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride
Screamin' out M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease
Fuckin' with a changed man

[JohntÃ¡ Austin (2Pac):]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
(Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man)

[Overlapping:]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
You fuckin' with a changed man
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
You fuckin' with a changed man
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
You fuckin' with a changed man

[2Pac:]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit.
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin' with a changed man
Changed man


[Jazze Pha (2Pac):]
Ladies and gentlemen! And gentlemen
This, is a Jazze Phizzile produc-shizzle 
Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha
My nizzle! 
My nizzle. Ha!
Outlawz! Outlawz. 2Pac, Makaveli!
(Still breathin') Yeah, woo - wooo-WHEEE!

A picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel it that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by
I said, "Hi."
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

[Jazze Pha:]
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like itâs a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange

[Jazze Pha:]
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said "take it" so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

[Jazze Pha:]
You do me

[Mya:]
Only one thing that you, can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
You can do whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange

(It's only one!!!) Only one thing that you, can do (thing that you can do for me), for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name (make me scream baby)

No one, gives me lovin' (lovin')
Quite like you do (No one gives me lovin' like you do)
No one, gives me lovin'
Quite like you do (that I knows, you know, you love, I love)
(The things that I'ma do, to you)


[2Pac:]
And my niggas say 
We want the fame!
Come on! Come on!

[2Pac:]
One thing we all adore 
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game 
Searchin' for fortune and fame

[2Pac:]
Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted
My revenge to increase my ends; enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, Death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fakin' fame

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny
Drunk nights, and hot days
Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
A wife on the run, full of common blunts
Unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame

[2Pac:]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

[Young Noble:]
Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
A lost of the game, with life the cost of the game
We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die, so united we stand
And if family come before, all the fortune and fame

[Napoleon:]
As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today
Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg
I was passed down the street fame 
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life, dog
We need to switch up lanes â think about it!

[2Pac:]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Been nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

[Bad Azz:]
I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame
It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself
Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
State of myself, my grind, and my family crew
Where one hand washes the other
No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
And that's real, life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree, that's fame to me â how about it?

[2Pac:]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game 
Searchin' for fortune and fame


[2Pac (singers):]
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz 
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Hahaha, yeah, nigga, fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Fuck all you muthafuckers!
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!

[2Pac:]
Now, I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch 'em back up
Notorious Biggie killer, affiliation with Death Row
Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool, this the West Coast
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these 
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin' 
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick 
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip 'cause, bitch, I love to scrap
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer 
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!

[Young Noble (singers):]
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)

[Kadafi:] 
Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets

[E.D.I.:]
Now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider (Ride)
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out, watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!

[Young Noble (singers):]
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'

[2Pac:]
I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up 
For my profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy, why? 'Cause they'll never stop us
I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger bust somebody in a movie
Now I want to do it too, ooh, ooh
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'mâ¦

[Young Noble:]
'Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game
Get your mob rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin', like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot, trust me

[Napoleon:]
Even my hood call me "baby Malcolm X"
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do

[Kastro:]
I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world, this guerrilla team of mine
Screamin', "Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!" and die for 'em
Even if the last nigga left I'ma ride for 'em
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
"Fuck 'em all, let them die!" â that's my slogan; fuck 'em all!

[Young Noble (singers):]
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)


[2Pac:]
Haha
For all my niggas in the hood (yeah!)
Livin' the life of a ghetto star
(you know) You know how we do it hahaha
Makaveli

[2Pac:]
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn't have tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)

[Nutt-So:]
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waiting to get done in
Back[?] - we tossed his ass out
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' at me through [?]

[2Pac:]
Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
Put cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

[Nutt-So:]
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star

[2Pac:]
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star

[2Pac w/ Nutt-So talking in background:]
This goes out to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)
That STILL, have to kill to make that money (still, I'll be puttin' down)
All you niggas on the block, sellin' rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police (sellin' motherfuckin' dopes)
(smokin' weed)
I see you
Live your life as a ghetto star
(look at these tramp ass hoes) Talk to the hood
Claimin' gettin' riches
(spank bitches ain't new)
Runnin' from new playa haters (any fake ass niggas)
Live my life as a ghetto star
(this is still 70 south)
Niggas with two strikes that don't wanna see the third (nah), I feel you
It's the Don Makaveli - live my life as a ghetto star


[Reporter:]
Good Evening.
[*sirens in the background*]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard where many excited fans have gathered with candles [*crowd starts chanting "2Pac"*] awaiting the much anticipated release, of 2Pac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz.
This is yet another post-humous release by 2Pac which, raises the question 
"Where are these songs coming from?" 
It's interesting how the message in these songs is still relevant today.
Even in his death he's touching people with his lyrics.
I can feel the energy in the air as they count down to midnight when the album will officially be released.
Oh, hold on. I think they're starting to countdown now.

[Crowd:]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.


[DJ Quik:]
Hey 'Pac, it's yo' boy
Hey man so far I've been listenin' to your album
And I ain't heard nuttin you could kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know?

Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggas think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?

[2Pac:]
I'm barely standin', and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights, cause we like
Yo' nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin', welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tongue-kissin' on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin' bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be poppin' so I'm stoppin' at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try
In the late night

[Samples (2Pac):]
"Last night.. last night changed it all" 
(In the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
(In the late night!)

[Hussein Fatal:]
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nuttin like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
Was poppin' like like cocked Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

[Kadafi:]
From booty-calls to bail sheets
It ain't no tellin' if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night 
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might
Be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the gun play for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'ma ride on that hide like cattle, cowards best to skedaddle
In the late night

"Last night.. last night changed it all" 
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
"Last night.. last night changed it all"
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"

[2Pac:]
Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggas in low-lows, pursuin' mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag', how many niggas wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labeled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, must be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clinton gettin' weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin'
Slappin' niggas known for tellin' bitches fuck-it
In the late night

[Samples (2Pac):]
"Last night.. last night changed it all" 
(It's in the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"
(In the late night!)
"Last night.. last night changed it all" 
(Holla at me in the late night!)
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!"


Young mothers (that's right)
I feel ya (hey) 
I know how it is 
Mama's just a little girl (just a little girl)
Don't nobody understand 
I feel ya 

[2Pac:]
She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why 
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
See her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, cuz even though they died
You can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin'
It's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby gone
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all 
I can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world
Facin' all this drama when Mama's just a little girl

[Kimma Hill:]
Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl 
Livin' if she is or not
Time ain't on her side 
Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high 

[2Pac:]
At sixteen
What a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?!)
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated 
If this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find? Little growin' boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growin' stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age 
Watch for police, don't come home (why?)
Cuz Mama's actin' crazy at the hospit-al
'Bout to have another baby 
Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within
Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home, from one act of inhumanity
Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted
Used to rub Her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us
Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey) 
How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama 
Cause Mama's just a little girl

[Kimma Hill:]
Mama don't know why (stupid motherfuckers don't know)
Mama's just a little girl 
Livin' if she is or not
Time ain't on her side 
Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high 
(How could she raise us) 

[2Pac:]
Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfilled prophecy
But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me
I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth
Only functions at the Pen', cuz everybody's in
Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares
No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey)
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl (Heyheyy)
Hell naw, (that's right) see mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)

[Kimma Hill:]
Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)
Livin' if she is or not
(y'all ain't facin' all this drama cause mama just a little girl)
Time ain't on her side
Cause Mama's just a little girl (Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high 

[2Pac:]
They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do 
And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life (Facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl)
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse, is to ignore from which we came (Mama's just a little girl)
You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had
Damaged petals
On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun 
Well, we are the roses (we are the roses)
This is the concrete (this is the concrete)
And these are my damaged petals (these are my damaged petals)
Don't ask me why (don't ask why)
Thank God, nigga (thank god)
Ask me how (Ahahaha)
You see, mama's just a little girl
Mama (hey)...
Mama...


[2Pac:]
Stand in formation, my motherfuckin' real troopers
Let's do it like soldiers - all and together now!
Ready? Hell yeah, y'all niggas better get ready
No retreat, no surrender, death before dishonor motherfucker!
Do it to 'em, c'mon never die thuggish, uh - YES YES YES
Say what? (Eastside, Westside ride) Where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at, where ya at?
Where my real thugs, where ya at?!
Hehehe, send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs, where ya at? You motherfuckin' home
Do it to 'em, do it to 'em
They love the way we do it to 'em, we do it to 'em

[2Pac:]
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the boot camp

[Cocoa Brovaz:]

[Tek:]
They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerrilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Putting likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined 
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

[Steele:]
Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position 
'Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

[Buckshot:]
Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move 'cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
'Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)

[Boot Camp Clik:]
Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong

[Cocoa Brovaz:]

[Tek:]
In the gaze of the strange, where nothing stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vus of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

[Steele:]
What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

[Buckshot:]
One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
'Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70s
Maybe that's why in the 90s I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
If you do you press rewind 
And you can peep guerrilla tactics in every line

[2Pac:]
Yeah, and this is how we do it!
Where my real thugs, where they at?
Let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
Won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?
Let me, see my real thugs, where ya at now?
Where my real thugs, let me see, where ya at?
Tell me where my real thugs gots to see, where ya at?
Where's my soldiers - where ya at?
Where my, real soldiers - where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, where ya at?
Get yo' strap my nigga; where ya at, where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, what ya at?
Getcha, thug niggas where ya at, witcha strap?
Where my soldiers at, where my true thug niggas
No longer drug dealers 'cause we now, thug niggas
Where my soldiers at, no longer drug dealers
'Cause we now, thug niggas, let me, where my
Where my soldiers at?, put your pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, put yo' guns up
Tell me where my soldiers at?, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my, SOLDIERS, my true thug ROLLERS
Yes, it just doesn't quit, YES!
This is that real hip-hop shit YES!
Fuck what you heard 
From the ghetto to the 'burbs, know we meant, every word
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Put yo' hand on the pistol, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, where my soldiers at?
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
When Bob Dole and Delores Tucker wanna know
Where my soldiers at, GO VOTE!


Damn, take a ride to my block
My block, that's right! Hehe
'Round my motherfuckin' way

They got a nigga sheddin' tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
'Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breast
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive? The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same, 'cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop, 'cause it don't stop â on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

Now shit's constantly hot on my block
It never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
Black males living in Hell; when will we prevail?
Fearing jail, but crack sales got me living well
And in a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God, help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep, 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
'Til this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home â on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

And I can't help but wonder why so many young kids had to die; caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives; Mama, come inside!
'Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community
But now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block, exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers; my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know you feel my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out, picking up game, sippin' cheap liquor
Gaming the hoochies, hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus â on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break, right?
Used to play fight with my homies, but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend
In my mind I see the same motherfuckers ballin'
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody know my name
Swear they all know me, and lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game â from my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Every block is kind to me
But on the block we still pray
But on the block we still pray

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
112 street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block â that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block â that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block â that's right
And the Jungle, Marin City, that's my block â that's right
Los Angeles, haha â that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown â that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggas stay kickin' up dust
Represent the motherfuckin' block


[2Pac:]
Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty, we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more, 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace if you can't grant it?
Niggas fightin' across the whole planet
So it could never be peace

[2Pac:]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all, just headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets 
'Cause there could never be peace

[Kastro:] 
Somebody owes me. Will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player, but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies, now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got frabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time after time after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally, but they heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgivin' we thankful, just for livin' in Hell
Damn, homie, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart. Never!

[Outlawz:]
The only peace we got is a piece of our heart, piece of our mind, or that damn piece that we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh

[2Pac:]
So will there ever be peace
Or are we all just headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace (never)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

[E.D.I.:]
Thangs is changin', nigga, you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times 
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick, but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love 
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Askin' God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper 
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it, soldiers dyin' for it, and in the ghetto, they cryin' for it. But fuck peace!

[2Pac:]
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom? Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace? 

[2Pac:]
Will there ever be peace? Shit, fuck peace!
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nothing?
You motherfuckers are smilin', but I'm mean muggin'
Why? 'Cause I gotta be thuggin'
It seems drugs done turned this whole mothafuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more 
How the fuck can you have a childhood
And you at the funeral every motherfuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you motherfuckers talkin' about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard? Lil' babies gettin' smoked, motherfuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings
Motherfuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga, is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace! We can't never have peace 'til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Til you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped
'Til we get a piece, fuck peace! Westside


[2Pac:]
Whassup, boo? Swear I'll never call you bitch again
You ain't fuck with me
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin' apologized)
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again

[2Pac:]
Damn â gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you
But without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world so, girl, just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)

[Tyrese (2Pac):]
We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

[2Pac:]
I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong
So an early riser out before them other guys
That's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, 'cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

[Tyrese (2Pac):]
We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)

['Pac:]
I know, I know, all that is dead though
I'm changed, I'm tellin' you
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up, ya know what I'm sayin'?
That was way back then

[Tyrese:]
You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, oh

[2Pac:]
Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work, boo?
I know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
Waitin' to exhale while I'm sittin' in the county jail
Keep your head up, 'cause things are gettin' better
My cellmate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the sufferin' that I feel
Who can I trust? And if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
Huh, I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
Thanks for being there much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again; believe me!

[Tyrese (2Pac):]
We came too far, to throw it all away
We came way too far, pretty baby
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away baby

[Tyrese:]
Through all my ups and downs
You always stayed around stayed around


Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, Iâm comin'


[2Pac:]
Straight motherfuckin' ballin', part 2
Still ballin', Westside!

[2Pac:]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas 'cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at ridin'
Passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

[2Pac (Trick Daddy):]
Still ballin' until I die (until I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'

[Trick Daddy:]
Now, as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin'
But when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
With clientele, any rhyme sales
Question is: Will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em "Thug Life" was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

[2Pac:]
Until the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'

[2Pac:]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
'Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

[2Pac (Trick Daddy):]
(I'm still ballin') 'til the day I die ('til I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
'Til the day I die (still ballin')
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Niggas wonder why (tell 'em!)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin', until the day I die
(Thug life), still ballin'
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Straight motherfuckin' ballin'


Turn it up in my head phones, please
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
More, ha ha, comin' to a ghetto near you

I wasn't mad until these tricks shot me
It's time I sanitize my posse
Look how paranoid these niggas got me 
Cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently
Mama, chill, thug livin' pay the bills, I'm dyin' violently
Closed caskets, expose bastards, I leave 'em bloody
Delores Tucker, don't let your kids
Hear a nigga speak on gettin' money
Ain't nothin' funny, green got a nigga seein' things
Why? Hit the lye, hope to God I can fly
Lethal weapon, I'm a savage; still a method to my madness
Blast niggas, laugh, call 'em care cabbage
Read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep, they hell bound
Lyrics will leave 'em spell bound
Clown, now tired of being held down
Cross my heart, hope to die, blind with some pussy
Millionaire, livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me
Hope in hard times never catch me slippin'
Fuck authorities! They wonder why minorities be trippin'
We ain't havin' it, time to tear this shit back
Ghetto children kick back
Once I hit the MAC, niggas'll never get they shit back
Spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me
Bust until my rounds empty; back for the street fame

One love to my true thugs
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
Bust! Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
All out warfare, eye for a eye 
Bustin' on my enemies, bad boy killin'
Straight dissin' you
Fuck Lil' Kim, you nasty bitch!

Temperatures rises, niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise
No time to plot retreats, niggas shiver and die
Multiple rounds found laced in his body and face
Wrapped in plastic, the acid erased all traces
Criminal tactics, the rap game became so drastic
Military mind, mash all the hoes, get blasted
If we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror
So we strive seein' our lives be reflected in mirrors
The prophecy is clear, niggas lock and load, disappear
Strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years
The crack game wasn't big enough, ready to rush
Bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched
I go to jail niggas screamin' free me, speakin' freely
Conversatin' with my comrades kickin' Swahili
Indeed they should fear my first seed
It gets worse, planned a curse to be a G, on the first to breathe
Currency in stacks, artillery in the back
Strapped, armies, we camouflaged in all black
When we attack, holla out my set, nigga
Tighten your jaw, givin' birth to Outlawz, street fame

Bust, nigga bust!
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
Only Makaveli the Don
Can put it down like this; ain't none like me
Comin' to a ghetto near you, with street fame

Positive identification, got me rushed to the station
Stuck in this line up, tryin' hard to hide my face
They placed the name but can't recall description 
I ain't did shit, officer, that bitch trippin'
Promise retaliation, their plan busted, no man to be trusted
Everything corrupted once man touch it
Kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me
That's why we bye bye daily, knowin' cops trail me
But why cry? Floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch
Flossin' in the thug stance, pistol tucked inside my pants
Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
Sure as hollow-points shatter, enemies die
Spread love, dead thugs gettin' buried in riches
Take a chance to advance; fuck them worryin' bitches!
Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray 
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day, hey!
Ain't nothin' strange, I'm 25, dyin' to change
But still I bang wantin' street fame

That's the end of that
Thugged out, Makaveli the Don 
Representin' the Outlawz, street fame
One love to my true niggas
Comin' to a ghetto near you street fame
Makaveli the Don, Killuminati
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame

Yo, check this out, I'ma tell you like this
If the lifestyle that you livin'
Got you taking more fuckin' shorts than gettin' props
Then that lifestyle need to stop 
Best to recognize some Outlaw shit 
'Cause only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to
To see what this life's supposed to be like 
Nigga, you'll start to see riches
Fine bitches and hittin' switches
Shit, to me that shit sound delicious; street fame


[2Pac:]
I don't know why I be fuckin' witchu

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit', tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

[Jazze Pha:]
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
Actin' like a ho', actin' like a ho'
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[Kastro:]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff, ho

[Yaki Kadafi:]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim
Straight through them spandex, don't front just name
Spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20 it ain't nothin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a ho? But there you go

[Jazze Pha:]
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
Actin' like a ho', actin' like a ho'
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[Young Noble:]
Uh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she, callin' me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin' dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like - damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty; and stop callin' while I'm workin' you hurtin' me
All this bullshit is irkin' me girl, but there you go

[Big Syke:]
I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
Cause there you go, just like a ho, caught in the streets
Like givin' yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin', so stop playin' (ho)
You hear what I'm saying, you only good for parlayin'
I'm layin' down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby cause I stay on the move

[Jazze Pha:]
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho' (there you go!!)
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho' (actin' like a real ho')
There you - there you go, actin' like a ho'
Actin' like a ho', actin' like a ho'
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour

HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

[2Pac:]
There you go baby girl, that's the story
There you motherfuckin' go
I coulda swore you told me you was gon' change
And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and
You wasn't fin' to dress all crazy no more and
You was gon' stay home and try to chill
What happened baby?
Oh, so yo' friend wanted to go out
That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin' out cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
Cause yo' friend wanted to get drunk huh?

So uh, there you go

HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE!..


[2Pac:]
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured 
And just looked at the whole situation 
'Cause once you look at it
You know, (really do)

[2Pac:]
They don't give a fuck about us 
They don't give a fuck about us 
They don't give a fuck about us 
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody give a fuck about us
And when I start to rise 
A hero in their children's eyes 
Now they give a fuck about us 

[2Pac:]
Some say niggas is hard headed 'cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin' to hide, hopin' that nobody don't notice
You must always remember
You're still a member of the hopeless
See, you're black like me, so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
Look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, our father figures is basers
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep 
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips, I gotta deal with brothers flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
We can change; what your mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
I'm bustin' shots, make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us 

[2Pac:]
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise 
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us 
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us 
But when I start to rise 
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us 

[E.D.I. Mean:]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone 
Time to reflect on what you did, 'cause they sayin' you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dawg; I don't doubt you
See, the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed
Not includin' yourself, all you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

[2Pac:]
I'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
I told you, last album, we need help cause we dyin'
Give us a chance, help us advance, 'cause we tryin'
Ignore my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust 
They don't give a fuck about us 

[2Pac:]
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us 
But when I start to rise 
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us 

[Kastro:]
Now, all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me 
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
Shit, nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong?
How long will I be mourned? 
When I'm gone, same song, ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin' 
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't; feel what I'm sayin'?

[Kadafi:]
Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
With the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to 
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin' 
Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and workin', I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season 
Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?

[Napolean:]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
'Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin'
Sometimes I think my block is dyin' and that is awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted 
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin' 
Nigga, I been so through pain, go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin' 
Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'
And I'ma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'

[2Pac:]
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us 
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
'Cause they don't give a fuck about us
Rise... rise


[2Pac:]
In this motherfucking life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks 
And crooked cops 
We still ride though 
What side? Westside

[2Pac:]
I want money in large amounts 
My garage full of cars that bounce 
Movin' my tapes in major ways, âcause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy Badass? Nigga, you scary
I've been knowin' you for years
We was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night that killed his kids

[2Pac:]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Young Noble:] 
I ain't a killer but don't push me, dawg
For the family I'll send that ass straight to God
In this life I lead, I seen the most of my 23 years
When vision is blurry, the money is clear
Some of my peers eternally will sleep in a coffin
And when Nob' on the road, I'm extremely cautious
It happen that fast, split second you gone
At the top of my tombstone put "Nob' was raw"
Outlaw 'til I'm under the floor, for Kadafi the Prince
I stack dough like I clocked all the bricks
With a watch on my wrist, dawg, I know the time these days
We Outlawz, we gon' die this way nigga (nigga)
We already in the history books, 'Pac made sure of that
Whatever you took, we takin' it back
You know it's all for the foundation 
Outlawz, we still buildin' the Thug Nation; holla at ya homie!

[2Pac:]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!

Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Napoleon:]
It ain't nothin' but in-between nuts, oxygen is gettin' hot
Got a problem, old fag-ass nigga, kick rocks
*Bin Laden* on the phone and that nigga talkin' crazy
I don't know who to blame, him or *Bush* for killin' babies
I'm a New Jerz' Devil, the street, creative rebel
Only got one shot to produce on every level
This is bags I must, go the max I must
Nigga, I came from not much, so money I clutch
Uh-uh, Napoleon the strength of the strong-arm
When they think they was in the right
I prove they movin' wrong
I'm a hardcore product of the ghetto
Been blessed fo' sho' to eat from out the ghetto
I maneuver, in the right lane, quick to push back brains
Switchin' to the left lane, I'm playin' my hands
And I'm plottin' on the fortune, it's gettin' hot and scorchin'
I'm diggin' like a scorpion that torture they enemies

[2Pac:]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[Kastro:]
Now with this Outlaw lifestyle that I been introduced to
Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer
Steady seducin' us and now I'm all for it
This the life for me and the law can't spoil it
So you can call it what the fuck you want
But I'm a ballin' alcoholic with a sawed-off pump
My momma ain't raised no punk; and neither did 'Pac
So when it jump off, I breathe for Yak'
Been puttin' in work, so I walk with a bop
And it ain't safe at home, so I sleep with a Glock (no mistakes)
Thug livin', uh, what the fuck'd be better?
I do my dirt with the family so we dyin' together

[E.D.I.:]
We on a mission for mo', gangsta shit on you hoes
We ain't fuckin' with you most
Just crooks and niggas about they flow
Tryin' to live Godzilla
E.D.I. went from a Bad Boy to an anybody killer
Look out, wanted man, guns in hand, stand firm
Nuts and my pride, now let's burn
Bound to the fam going down swingin'
Holding my ground, now we the last ones breathin'
Won't stop until we even deep in the trenches
So many killings it's senseless
So in this life I lead, I stay protected
By God, my squad, and this thing in my palm
Now all my hustlin' motherfuckers, get your money, sing along

[2Pac:]
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

[2Pac:]
This motherfuckin' life I lead, nigga
You know what time it is 
Westside, Death Row
(Dogg Pound) e'rybody killer
Bad Boy killer, So So Def killer
Thug Life, Death Row
E'rybody killer; fuck all y'all niggas!
If it ain't Westside, nigga, it ain't poppin'
That's on my mama


[2Pac:]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[2Pac:]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
And even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place
The players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Anthony Hamilton:]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[2Pac:]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me, "Home is where the heart is."
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
'Cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll? If you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, "Peace!"
While the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Anthony Hamilton:]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[2Pac:]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps
With Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown; tell the lady in the liquor store
That she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

[Anthony Hamilton (2Pac):]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky


Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion

[2Pac:]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[J. Phoenix (Nas):]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Nas:]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rolling by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm trying to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much suffering
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion

[J. Phoenix:]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothing but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[2Pac:]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doing good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Dripping peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sitting there kicking it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last

So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

[2Pac:]
Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
To my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
Inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
My lyrics are poetry, so baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
Layin' butt-naked on the beach kicking back relaxin'
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin' at the walls
Withcha number in my hand, wonderin' should I even call her tonight

[Jazze Pha (2Pac):]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life (call me thug)
Never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want (call me thug)
And girl you know I got you
You got what I need (call me thug)
And shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

[2Pac:]
Been gettin' nuttin' but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin' breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin' love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
Come get a shot of this plain dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, 'cause every time we touch..
...it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
If you call me

[Jazze Pha (2Pac):]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life (call me thug)
Never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want (call me thug)
And girl you know I got you
You got what I need (call me thug)
And shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

[2Pac:]
Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby 'cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
'Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the Hyatt, if it feel right
My only wish is to be witcha
You got me steady strivin' to getcha
Fantasizin' of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin' major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places
What will it take? 'cause the heartache be heatbreak
Is my prediction when you falsify and start fake?
In my position I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

[Jazze Pha:]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me


Hell yeah [*2Pac yawning*]
Hahaha

[2Pac:]
And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, "Have a heart" â fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force 
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore it
A war? They ain't ready for it haha

[2Pac (Young Noble):]
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)

[Kastro (Young Noble):]
My nine is Thug lord, my mind on my grind
Outlawz is my heart, they shine when I shine
(My rhyme is my grind, my team be on role)
(Proceed with the onslaught, indeed they all talk)
(They all marks and it's an Outlaw holocaust)
When I got the sawed-off. (Niggas gettin' hauled off)
Yeah, nigga beware, stand clear
This nigga's scared, man, I don't really care
I've been lost love, my heart need a hug
My bite need blood, I fight with a grudge
The life of a thug nigga might need gloves
But you'll never know with a price on your mug
Them fight strips snug right around your hands
Makin' sure you can never grab the mic again
Dog, you fuckin' with a grown man
Can't I can't afford to lose
Where we from niggas torture dudes
So whatcha wan' do?

[2Pac (Young Noble):]
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you

[2Pac:]
Haha, watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm a outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' 'til I die
In my drop-top, double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show 
Watching niggas out of sight, in my night scope
Cookin' white dope, got my nigga 25-to-life stressed out
Tryin' to have all the better things in life
While Makaveli â a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the Bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth and the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Tryin' to beat me out my last breath
What cha gonna do? 

[2Pac (Young Noble):]
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, now nigga now
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, throw you hands up
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, would you wanna fuck?
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, bust 'em, when my niggas come for you
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you, come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
(What y'all gonna do?)


Fugees! Fugees and Mobb Deep
Tryin' to diss now too, huh?!
Hahaha! Well, I ain't prejudiced
I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like
When we ride on our enemies
Biatch! When we ride on our enemies

Hey, got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Used to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me
Look, bitch: I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
Then, we watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
Bam! Set my plan in mo'
Time to exterminate my foes; I can't stand you hoes
Uh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die
When we ride on our enemies

Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die; say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream "Peace!" after they start some shit
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga, you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well
Hell, how many niggas wanna be involved?
See, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies

When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die
When we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies, hehe
I make sure everybody die
When we ride, on our enemies


[Intro: 2Pac]
Let us pray
Heavenly Father, hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

[Verse One: 2Pac]
I see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God cause we livin in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer

[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if I'm worthy
Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
So I'm askin -- before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change?  I'm askin

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Kadafi]
Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
Cause he just came home off of bail

[2Pac] Now tell me

[Chorus]

[Outro: spoken word]
Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah?  Or Allah?
Is it Jesus?  Is it God?  Or is just yourself?
Definately not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing!
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his OWN man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man

[2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin

[singing while 2Pac speaks]
Who do you believe in?  Put my faith in God, and
Blessed and still breathin

[singer + (2Pac)]
Even though it's hard (Who do you believe in?)
That's who I believe in (Put my faith in God)
Before I'm leavin (Even though it's hard)
I'm askin the grievin
(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)
Who do you believe in? (Who do you believe in?)
Who do you (Blessed and still breathin)
Oh blessed, oh blessed
(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)

[singer]
Oh who do you 
Do you believe in 
Hohhhhh-ohhhhh

[2Pac over singer]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?

[singer + (2Pac)]
I'm askin (Who do you believe in?)
I'm askin you (Put my faith in God)
(That's who I believe in)
(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)

[2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I'm blessed and still breathin
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in? [echoes to fade]


[Big Syke:]
Thug life, microphone check
Outlaw microphone check
Where you bitch niggas coming from?
You don't know, look like you a seed
From Makaveli The Don

I can hear your style, sounds like Makaveli The Don
2Pac, my nigga
So much trouble in the world nigga
These niggas can't feel your pain
Thug life, outlaw forever
Oh you bitch niggas

The hardest nigga
Ever to touch this microphone
Got you bitch niggas trailin' his tail
I don't know if you catch up, but yet and still
Keep trying nigga, keep trying nigga
Thug life, Outlaw forever nigga
Eternity, infinity
So remember Makaveli The Don
His thug life lives on


[2Pac:]
Nigga, westside!
Westside in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker

[2Pac:]
Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin'
Packed in a Suburban
Screaming, "Outlaw!", runnin' on the curb
They never try me, 'cause right behind me a killer team
I get the word, cut the head off a nigga, like a guillotine
This Hennessy will keep me calm though
Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin' convo
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga, watch me with the chrome 9
All the time drinkin' champagne
Walk through the crowd, let the tramps hang
Niggas player hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin' 80, down a one-way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin'
My alibi, addictively
Like them other vile men, I'm marked for death
Spendin' my nights like it's the last one left; I'm an outlaw

[2Pac:]
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
I'm the last one left
Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
Guess I'm the last one left

[Napoleon:]
I got my back against the wall, gat chillin' by my balls
Prior to war is a rider nigga that's only 5'6" tall
Napoleon only knows on we Outlaws, fuck fear
Better strap down to the fullest, 'cause we outchea
Thug passion all up in me, feelin' like I took some Henny
It ain't easy, I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got is rep, nigga, wanna pull their gat, nigga
He's only got my side 'cause they think 'Pac died, nigga
Blast niggas with our TEC's, takin' showers in our vest
'Pac, come and catch weight, nigga, we the last ones left

[2Pac:]
If we would've known the zone inside my own dome
Fresh outta jail, it was hell, but I'm finally home
Lookin' for niggas that was woofin' that shit
When I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when it cocked back
Fuck 'em all, they're bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak; we the last ones left

[2Pac:]
Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
Like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on
Last to leave, 'til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
Like I'm the last one left

[Kastro:]
I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth
Me and my team super supreme, puttin' in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, 'til it hurt
And I call Earl screaming, "Fuck the world!"
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wifey beefin', wanna know if she gon' see me tonight
And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got
And that's until I see Yak, and that's until I see 'Pac
Young know I lost a troll, somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl
I'd stick my dick in the ground; fuck the world!

[2Pac:]
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfuckerâ¦
Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here
Outlawz in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfuckerâ¦
Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker
In this motherfucker right hereâ¦


[2Pac:]
Te quiero
Te quiero cojer, te quiero cojer
I'll let your ass have it, te quiero cojer
Te quiero cojer, oh real?
Te quiero cojer

[2Pac:]
Now you've been actin' like you want it for a long time
All up in a nigga face, givin' me them strong vibes
Look in my eyes and you'll find peace
A Gemini, so you really blow my mind freak
Come on, I got my clothes off, hard as a nigga in jail
Skinny niggas throw the dick well
Everybody get their condoms, brother cause it's time to fuck
Hurry up and put it on nigga, time is up
What's next? Got my mind on some group sex
Where you goin', baby? I ain't even through yet
Do it like a true vet, love it how I threw it to ya
Even now make it good to ya, remember me?
I love fuckin' slow with the lights low
Black, Puerto Rican, even White hoes
Bellisimo, que linda, dame un beso, come to Papi
Fuck until the shit is sloppy
If you really want it

[2Pac & Left Eye:]
If you really want it
Get'cha ass up; you know it, if you really want it

[Left Eye:]
Do you, you remember the time
When you absolutely, said never let it inside
Feel it's my duty, from Gemini, to Gemini
Can you [?] imagine the trouble [?] then double, I'm much obliged
See I would love to go and take a ride
Have total leeway up and down your freeway, nothing to hide
If I was committed to suicide
I'd fuck around meet you now put it down, I'd testify
Ain't nobody here to understand the reason why
It's you and I, so everything is rectified
I know you tried, you even made a nigga cry
But love is blind, now can you stand the test of time?
Redefine, what it means to be an open mind
Feel the climax.
I bust a round for you, painted the perfect picture
I'm down for you, can't wait to get wit'cha

Rock, your body body, rock your body
Rock, your body body, rock your body

To keep goin' now I'm fuckin' like I'm killin' ya
Let's go another round baby is you down really
Two shots of ecstasy Lick a nigga down silly
Your body next to me
I could touch you inside, and you'll cry
So good when a nigga leave, you'll die
My mama told me baby be a man put it on her
Hittin' bitches like, switches comin' around the corner
I wanna let me get my ride on
It's yo' dick baby but it's my song
If you really want it

[2Pac:]
Gots to send this one out to the freaky bitches
Definitely all the Scorpios, and the Geminis, and the Virgos
You know I know the truth about you Scorpios and you Virgos
No doubt gotta give it to the Capricorns
They some freaks too on the down down
The Libras, they like it even but they still like fuckin'
No doubt, Aquariuses, Libras, I said those
Leos (if you really want it), yeah they some freaks, Leos is freaks
They always wanna run shit in bed
Sagittarius(if you really want it), Taurus, Cancer, all you freaky fucks (if you really want it)

Here me and my closest road dogs
To my dog named Mussolini (you know it dog)
Big Syke (Westside)
Thug Life, baby (outlaw)
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Hahaha!

Shit half the times we fought and caused trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin' from the future, escapin' in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
(me and my closest road dog)
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine

Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy you's a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer
Ain't tryin' to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggas disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin' information to the feds
The burnin' bed was the tellin' sign
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
(Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz)
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine

Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin'
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'
See me in physical form, my niggas swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggas 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin' for fake niggas, observe and shake niggas
The only way to see six figures, is break niggas
Me and Mussolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi,homicide ask us why
Labeled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
(my closest road dogz)
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, (my closest road dogz)
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine


[Lil' Mo:]
2Pac and Lil' Mo, hmm, how gangsta is that?
Hehe... ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh

[*Mo keeps harmonizing in the background*]

[2Pac:]
One two to a nigga nature, haha.
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin' surprised? You saw the bullshit
Comin' fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom PÃ©rignon
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that "Buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?

[Lil' Mo:]
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (that's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature

[2Pac:]
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

[Lil' Mo:]
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature

[2Pac:]
Haha, started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin' - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattooed so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart and a real live nigga nature

[Lil' Mo:]
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (that's a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature (cause that's a nigga nature)
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin' life, and gettin' high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature (hey, just be a nigga nature)
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
It's a love and hate relationship
But that's a thug's nature (cause that's a nigga nature)

[2Pac & Lil' Mo:]
It ain't my fault
Hehe, Q.D., where you be? Ah
Don't blame me blame my momma, a nigga nature

[Lil' Mo harmonizing:]
QDIII, and Lil' Mo
2Pac, puttin' it down fo' sho' ("'cause that's a nigga nature")
I realize, that I'm feelin' it
Cause that's a thug nature
Though sometimes I can deal with it
I realize, I'm feelin' it
Love and hate, relationship
Cause that's a thug's nature ("'cause that's a nigga nature")
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah. 
Yeah yeah, and that's a thug's nature

Where you at? Holla


This ain't livin', nigga!

[2Pac:]
I hear even the smaller G's be dippin' Chevy Impalas
While flossin' their gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We swallow tomorrow's seed, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em lead tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, they rap
Still I be starin', watch the parents sacrifice their child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug dealers
Now one for adolescents, now dos for those
Keep your friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to take my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw your hands in the air, it's a robbery
(censored) 'Pac, would you ride with me?
Let's go see what our enemies talkin' 'bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we're trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know
This is how it goes when we floss with flows
Before I toss your ho, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows, make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin'

[Vanessa (2Pac):]
Takes a life to make a life, takes a life
Livin' in the world of crime and I, takes a life
(This ain't livin')
Can't find a better way to break through
(This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do)
(This ain't livin')
Takes a life to make a life, takes a life
Livin' in the world of crime and I, takes a life
Can't find a better way to break through
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do

[2Pac:]
Peep it â gunfire is produced at alarmin' rates
Today's youth, quick to shoot, get in the car and break
"It Takes a Nation of Millions" if we intend to stop the killin'
Just search your feelings, participatin' should be appealin'
They're our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue
My young nation, rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
That oppose when I froze them fools
And who are you, to watch me fall farther?
I disappeared, reappeared as the (censored)
Follow me now
Skippin' class, and livin' fast, will get your ass
Stuck in the Pen', doin' life plus ten
Young brother pump your brakes for me
Before you choke, won't you soak up some game from your big homie
This ain't livin', we givin' you jewels, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin' hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me
This ain't livin'

[Vanessa:]
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break through
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break through
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break through
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)

[2Pac:]
Put me in that; ay come on JoJo ('Pac hahaha)
Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)

[2Pac:]
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cause that excites me to lay the pipe
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me
So whatchu sayin' girl?

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me
I got a lot of thug in me, lot of thug (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna put in you (maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, can you check it
I got a lot of thug in me. Do you want it (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

[2Pac:]
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin'
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin' (haha)
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me), lot of thug

A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, can you check it
I got a lot of thug in me, do you want it
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

[2Pac:]
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it? Oh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to cum
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin' thug in you

[K-Ci & JoJo (2Pac):]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me
That I wanna put in you and you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me)
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you

Oh yeah! Like me! Yeah, look at me baby, yeah, yeah

I hold a lot of thug in me, I gotta be some thug in ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[2Pac:]
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations
I don't got no motherfuckin' explanations, y'knahmsayin?
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin' why I'm pullin' your hair
And why I fuck so motherfuckin' thuggish
That thug passion, y'knahmean?
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of?
Didn't you come over here to get fucked? (no)
You ain't come over here for me to be
Strokin', and all that bullshit
You came over here to get fucked (no)
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin' bout, "2Pac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over! Maybe it's the thug in me!


[2Pac:]
Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me, nigga
C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car, man
Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car, man
Get in the fuckin' car, get in the car
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car
'Cause you, you think niggas gon' be blastin' at it
It ain't even that deep baby)

[2Pac:]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes

[2Pac:]
Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my comp
Gettin' wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
While niggas run I'm the last one standin', the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggas die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggas tried to kill me, and I fed their wife and their daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggas never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck
Quit bullshit nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch
Niggas got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame

[Young Noble:]
Y'all remember "Hit 'Em Up," don't make us do it once more
Yo' niggas know, you ain't fuckin' with them Out-lawz
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin'
Don't nobody give a fuck 'cause you done crossed the game
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it
You scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin' the flo'
We dirty as the motherfuckin' streetz of Jerz
We sweep niggas with the words though the heat's preferred
Holla

[2Pac:]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let the punks know

[E.D.I.:]
'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin' car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God, nigga
I only got one click, Outlawz 'til I'm gone
Heavy in the game and we comin' for they fuckin' throne
The love is gone well it is what it is
And plottin' on us, they best be prayin' for they kids, mayne
You don't have to worry 'cause I ride for ya
Like K said over loyal we even tell 'bout a lie for ya
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin' I'ma fuckin' ball for ya
And everything I do gon' have your names on it
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it

[Napoleon:]
You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest
You studio niggas still remind your vest
Why the fuck you ain't done yet, swallow yo' teeth
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat
If your life in another nigga hand, you dead
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it
Another fake nigga usin' my strengths to get credit
I mean you might face sound scared but your heartbeat said it

[2Pac:]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know

[Kastro:]
I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty
But now I'm a rider, connivin' gutsy
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me
And that's how I'ma go about it 'til somebody bust me
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
And I think I'm goin' crazy 'cause my hair is gettin' thinner
I've been drinkin' on the daily, I can hardly remember
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me
I sleep light, I wake peekin' out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And that's the way it's gonna be 'til they bury me
But don't twist it 'cause none of y'all niggas worry me

[Young Noble & Kastro:]
What the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza-Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt
My niggas couldn't fade me with some clippers
You put it down, look all around, 'til we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you

[Kadafi:]
Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin' through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me fee to let my ice click Ka-pling, ka-plow I been a thug shootin' slugs since a child

[2Pac:]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know


[2Pac:]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask for currency
But you could run to me when you need and I'll never leave
Honestly, someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thang to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could
Cause in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me, "Will I change?"
I tell her yea, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time 

[Richard Page:]
So take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...

[2Pac:]
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a player I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Richard Page:]
Take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...

[Richard Page:]
Take, these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live so free
(Until the end of time)
So we can fly away, 'til the end of time
Take, these broken wings...

[2Pac:]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an Outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about, more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Richard Page:]
Take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly, 'til the end of time

[Richard Page:]
Take, these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live so free
(Until the end of time)
So we can fly away, 'til the end of time
'Til the end of...

[2Pac:]
I don't know what it is that got me actin' all crazy out here
Guess it's just my environment, how you people be treatin'
(Until the end of time)
Shit, I'll be back in a while?
Ain't no mystery, you get what you give, feel me?
When it comes I'll be like, I can't tell you what?
Maybe it's the thug in me


When thugs cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When thugs cry, times is hard

Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up
Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts
My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. 'cause I'm fuckin' his secretary
I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped her, so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'
What is the meanin' when thugs cry?

[Singer (2Pac):]
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry)
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries
But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel
To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne
See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die, 'cause even thugs cry

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
'Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams
Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood
Clownin', takin' pictures later
Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

I shed tattooed tears for years
For my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Y'all ain't never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die?


[2Pac:]
(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers, just be friends)
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turning on me?
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?

[2Pac:]
I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until 2Pac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin' cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes
And we might, just blast God bless the child, that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
Talk a lot of shit but you's a trick in drag
Like the MAC make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab

[Singers & 2Pac:]
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee (yeah nigga)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G

[2Pac:]
It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Although two juvenile delinquents, we still decent
Playin' catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin' drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin' brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? [*laughter*]
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck Wendy Williams and I pray you choke
On the next dick down your throat
For turnin' on me

[Singers & 2Pac:]
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G

[2Pac:]
I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen Wendy Williams fat ass?
Why you always wearin' Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat ho
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
Through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
And put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's 2Pac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
And Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
He shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin' ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
He don't step in the fuckin' ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what 2Pac gon' do
When niggas come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin' other
This old motherfuckin' nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it

[Singers & 2Pac:]
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G..
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G
(Fuck you too nigga!)


[2Pac:]
Hehehe, yeah
These are my words to my firstborn

[2Pac:]
Can you picture young niggas in a rush to grow?
'Til hard-timers in the pen' had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin'
Too busy bullshittin', caught him with his mouth runnin'
Ain't this a bitch? They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit
Now shit is flipped, 'cause niggas died over bullshit
It's not my dream, I'm seein' pictures of a broken man
No witnesses only the questions of who smoked the man
Young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime
Though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times
Livin' blindâLord, help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer
One love to the thugs in Heaven, I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my firstbornâfeel me!

[2Pac:]
My words to my firstborn
My words to my firstborn

[2Pac:]
Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So, I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me, there was no distortion
'Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, 'cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin', sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end, drivin' with the car runnin'
Blinded, ain't no love in the hood, only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, 'cause the family wasn't able
Can't blame her, I would do the same
All I could give her was my debt and my last name
'Cause in the game things change, livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my firstbornâfeel me!

[2Pac:]
My words to my firstborn
Mmm! (Yeah)
These are the words to my firstborn
Hey, nigga, talk to your born!
Talk to your seed, nigga!

[Above the Law:]
Two thousand somethin' somethin' mention a new era
A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear
See, there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
(What else is it, dawg?) â the velvet and the silk
And makin' sure my kittens got they milk
(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress
Let my kids know I'm at this
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll
Ain't no question, is it? Above the Law hustlers
If it's related to chips, homie, we'll handle ya

Yo, although we never take advantage
Though we always into ery'thang
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So, only associate yourself
With paper chasers and niggas that's truly down
And keep God first
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin' their tits, hella thick, tryin' to get you for yo' grip
I know you stressed-out and fed-up
But come out, gun-blazin', and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to, but it ain't gon' change
Above the Law, 2Pac, O.G.'s in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom to give to our firstborn

[2Pac:]
What you gon' tell your kids, nigga?
Who was you? What was you doin'?
How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherfuckin' firstborn
So, they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' rider
Westside 'til I die, that's all it was
It's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker
I just played to win, just played to win
Motherfucker gotta bet against the odds, y'knahmean?


[Dave Hollister:]
Brenda's got a baby

[2Pac:]
I hear Brenda's got a baby
But Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family
Well let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie putting death into his arms
It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's getting bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's having a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexing her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together, whatever
He left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so
She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap bawling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say, you making me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell
It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby


(Suddenly I see some niggas that I don't like)
[*machine gun fires*]
(Got him)

[2Pac:]
A smoking-ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit 
Catch him on the streets, I'mma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said "Freeze!"
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk, please
'Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin' like a bitch, cause you don't know how to, hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggas

Crooked ass niggas
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see--)
(Cri-cri-criminal)

[Stretch:]
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick stepping to the niggas with the props
and any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin' gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin' weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's trying to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten kis, I'mma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fucking Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get a-WAY!
Niggas got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch

The crooked ass niggas
(Criminal behaviour)
Yeah, you don't stop!
Crooked ass niggas
(Criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)

[2Pac:]
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
Crooked ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in
They'll try to get 'cha, they'll sweat 'cha to get in the picture
And then they hit 'cha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer
(Criminal behaviour-- crimi-criminal behaviour)
Crooked ass nigga
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal
Crimi-crim-criminal behaviour (haviour)-- criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Criminal behaviour- criminal be- criminal crim--
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal be- crim-crim-crim-crim-crim--
Criminal behaviour-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
[*machine gun fires*]
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
[*machine gun fires*]
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
[*machine gun fires*]
(Got him)


[Skit:]
"What's up?"
"Yo this scene, rollers tried to jack a nigga 'cause a nigga with a pearl rollin' on a CoupÃ© with goldens."
"Yo man, what's up, this riding motherfucker
Jack me at rollin' 'round bumping
'Cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Yo this P-O to the G-O
Motherfucking cop just jacked me 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley."
"What's up, man?"
"Aight, man, fuck 'em."

[2Pac:]
I don't give a fuck
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly, 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check 
I get more respect from the mothafucking dope man
The Grammy's and American Music shows
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed, 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break. How much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere no how
Bush wanna throw down?
Better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger from the mothafuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A mothafucking 90's nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough!
Yeah, and i just don't give a fuck

[Pogo:]
Nigga, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitudes is shitty
So tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say we niggas like to do niggas
So me an' a cop are just two niggas
A street-walking nigga and a beat-walking nigga
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast take his cash before I dash I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
'Cause a nigga like P, don't really give a fuck

[2Pac:]
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit â ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere â but where?
'Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack, in fact who's the black Jack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fucking nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers â stay strong, keep your heads up
They know we fed up; but they just don't give a fuck

They just don't give a fuck

[2Pac:]
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San Francisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department
Fuck you to the FBI
Fuck you to the CIA
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice motherfuckers
That wanna fuck with me, fuck y'all!
Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards
2Pacalypse motherfuckerin' now
Y'all can all kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck y'all
Punks [*echoes*]


Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

"If you ever need a place to stay"
"Well, alright, y'all"
"Brothers and sisters"

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rapping tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

"If you ever need a place to stay"
"Well, alright, y'all"
"Brothers and sisters"

Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call

"If you ever need a place to stay"
"Well, alright, y'all"
"Brothers and sisters"


[scratched w/ minor variations â 2Pac & Poppi:]
She's a part time mutha

[2Pac:]
Meet Cindi
She's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic Tac
Now what's that say about this big epidemic
This hypocritical world and the people in it
Now speakin' of, in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiendin' for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook; got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mother, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggas hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha

I gotta live with a part time

[scratched w/ minor variations â 2Pac & Poppi:]
She's a part time mutha

[Angelique:]
I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, every night, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest and yes I was nervous
Was this a test? I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin' if she hasn't got a fix in, so
Now I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin' how my step dad raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class and yet I'm missin' periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearin' it
I gotta tell mom before she sees me
I told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me
Callin' me a slut cause my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
I can't believe the way he caught her
Got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha

[2Pac:]
I gotta live with a part time

[scratched w/ minor variations â 2Pac & Poppi:]
She's a part time mutha

[2Pac:]
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock
She's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
Cause she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin' ever since
The clothes the food the cars and, oh, the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me this in the first place
So, I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream no more
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha
And I change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha

[scratched w/ minor variations â 2Pac & Poppi:]
She's a part time mutha


Rebel... rebel
Rebel
Rebel... rebel

They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain
So with a little bass and treble
Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face
Pump up the bass, and join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground

Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
[4x]

Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse
Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out
2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna
And doin' what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground

Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
[4x]

They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout
So what's wrong with the media today
Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin' from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So, yo, to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin' records 'bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground

2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground
[8x]

'Emember
More than an adversary, I'm very quick
I'm ready to hit 'em with this gift, I'm equipped to kick
So, grab your coat and your hat, cause I'm prepared to clown
Let's carry this end that throw these motherfuckers down
Oh shit, 2Pacalypse is back and strapped
Attackin' the packs, I'm kickin' the facts for stacks to rap
And those that max, relax and let the blacks get jacks
I'm gettin' taxed, my packs is packed with angry blacks
I'm ready to go
I'm rippin' the shows, hittin' the dough
Gettin' the hoes, clothes
Pumpin' the flow, thanks to the hump
Cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote, rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you're used to
Ki-ki-ki-kickin' the funky flava
Pumpin' the deuce with no producers
Run for cover when you hear the bass drum
One verse is all it takes

Crack done took a part of my family tree
My momma's on the shit, my daddy split and mom is steady blaming me
Is it my fault just 'cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail 'til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
"Remember Rodney King?" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case...
You speak of heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz' and a black mask
Ducking fuckin' Task, now who's the jackass?
Keep my shit cocked, 'cause the cops got a Glock too
What the fuck would you do? Drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin' the cop
I got me a Glock, and a Glock for the niggas on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new king
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thick
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolin' in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps
A soulja

All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja

[2Pac as the younger brother:]
Buck, buck - niggas get fucked, don't step to this
Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, nigga it's hectic
Here's the anorexic, I'm makin' it to an exit
Walking through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, 'cause I'm on some pay 'em back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brother, you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin' him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
Niggas from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin' double vest... so aim at my fuckin' chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin' up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout
"Hit the pen nigga -- break your bigger brother out"
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gordon
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker making death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin' out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja

All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me

[2Pac:]
Oh shit, jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin' motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggas get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps coming when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic

[Stretch:]
Yeah, fuck that God! Word up
Blowin' niggas out the motherfuckin' frame, you know what I'm sayin'?
Constantly, fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it

[2Pac:]
Leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin' like Tyson
I'm grippin' the mic and my DJ is slicin'
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin' to me with the same old
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin' motherfuckers like a shootin' star
Cause I'm out to show that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin' condom
Niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
Feel the wrath, and revenge of tha' lunatic

[Stretch:]
Yeah Tu', tell 'em motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin' it, none of that shit!
Bitch ass niggas, niggas can't fuck with us Tu', word up
'91, we takin' this whole motherfucker over
Niggas got problems in '91, '92, and '93
And all that other shit, word up

[2Pac:]
Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin' shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin' for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
Ducked and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin'
Stop trippin' off these niggas cause they ain't about nuttin'
Or should I say naythin'
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic

[Stretch:]
Ah yeah, fuck that, you know what I'm sayin'?
(The motherfuckin' lunatic)
Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggas what time it is, 'kna'm sayin'?
(punk motherfuckers, get the dick of the lunatic)
Niggas can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggas, fuck 'em

[2Pac:]
Fuck all them niggas
I'm tellin' these niggas that they ain't got
Naythin' on a nigga like me
We squashin' these punk motherfuckers in '91
'92, '93, and so on
So let the beat FLOAT on
While I spray these PUNK BITCHES
with these dope ass lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin' the dank
Now it's money in the BANK
And all y'all niggas shit stank
Compared to this shit
Fuck y'all punk bitches!
Tha' Lunatic *echoes*


You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never talk peace in the black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I done a lot of growin' up
Getting drunk, throwin' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harasses me I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped

Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

They got me trapped
Can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang, bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie, don't play that
It's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm trying to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

Now I'm trapped and want to find my getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the devil's friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinking, all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, "Damn homies is dissing you."
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said, "Freeze, or you'll be dead today."
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped

Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh, uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down


They claim that I'm violent
Just 'cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits
'Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
Envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self-defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
'Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every Jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent

"They claimin' that I'm violent."
"Fuck the damn cop!"
"Just because we play what the people want."
[3x]

The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, 'cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"
He had the nerve to say that I had a curfew
("Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!")
Get out the car - or I'll hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)
("What you doing, man?")
They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked ("I'm out!") he tried to run 
(Freeze, nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste of trading places
And all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this frame up,
But I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent

"They claimin' that I'm violent."
"Fuck the damn cop!"
"Just because we play what the people want."
[3x]

As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-oh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (damn!). Now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (damn!). We in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
(that's a lotta of one time)
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
(yeah, it's on now)
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
(What's next, man?) What's next? I don't know and I don't care
One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason to claim that I'm violent

"They claimin' that I'm violent."
"Fuck the damn cop!"
"Just because we play what the people want."
[3x]


Killing us one by one
In one way or another
America will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's
And one by one
We are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
That we are not fighting back
Brothers, sisters, niggas
When I say "nigga" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga
Niggas, what are we going to do?
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must die, like niggas

This is for the masses, the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation? Please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me
This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'
But it's wrong to keep someone from learning something
So get up, it's time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children
That they can be all that they want to be
There's much more to life than just poverty

This is definitely uh... words of wisdom
AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?

Words of Wisdom
Based upon the strength of a nation
Conquer the enemy armed with education
Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do
Know thyself, teach by what we've been through
Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?
'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime
But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable
They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe
'Cause it will strangle ya
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty
Thought they had us beaten when they took out King
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom

NIGHTMARE! That's what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and the evil that you gave me
I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people
For Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
Ha, but you cannot escape fate
For it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you will fall
By my hands
America, you reap what you sow

[2Pac:]
Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack
And fuck going to jail
'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look
I don't sell yayo
They judging a brother like covers on books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hitting 'em out of the doors
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fucking the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddaya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says ho
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check
Now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real niggas bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males

Yes, nigga, N-I-G-G-A, niggas
Ay, nigga, you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smells like skunk, skunk smells like that nigga, momma
We ain't nuttin' but some low down dirty niggas
Keep it real, nigga! Fuck you, nigga!
You ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ides, it's an Old E thing, baby
Strictly some of that Hennessy
Can I drink with you, fellas? Can I get it on it?
Fuck you, capo. You ain't in, baby
I tell you what! You guys are not gonna be talking
All that shit, when I come back, OK?
We gonna say who the big mouth, when I come back
Young black male!


Bury me a G
Thug Life
Feel me

[2Pac:]
Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
A young G gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play
I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
And comin' home at 6 o'clock in the mornin'
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Sippin' on gin with a couple of friends
Say them Thug Life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to the rules was a major sin
And if I die, let it be
But when it come for me, bury me a G

[2Pac:]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

[Mopreme:]
More trouble than the average
Just made 25 and I'm livin' like a savage
Being a G, it ain't no easy thing
'Cause you could fuck around, get crossed and get stuck in the game
And for the rest of your life you will sit and reminisce
Wonder why it had to end like this
And to the G's you can feel my pain
Until the motherfucker gets born again

[Rated R:]
You thought it was a game kid, I'm not the nigga for playin' game
I let my buckshots ring when I pull the trigger on my gauge
I'm on the rampage makin' runs for the Devil
Ain't nothin' on my mind will get me into trouble
I'm tryna ride no more loves for me hard to figure
Get a nigga, smoke a blunt or it's a jury starts (Break yo self)
I gives a fuck nigga stuck outta luck when I bust
Pull me to my death but I'm a G to the enemy

[2Pac:]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

[Big Syke:]
I got nothin' to lose so I choose to be a killer
Went from bangin' to slangin', now I'm a dope dealer
All my life paid the price to be the boss
Back to school, broke the rules on gettin' tossed
Poppin' rocks on the block was a past time
Pack a .9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
Don't cry, I die before they play me
From the cradle to the grave, bury me G

[Macadoshis:]
Straight thug kickin' it with the homies in the hood
Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, my bitch said I'm no good
I gives a fuck I spend my time in the dope spot
Never had no time for no bitch instead slangin' rocks
And bustin' caps on you punk ass marks
Fake ass G's, bitch niggas with no heart
I'm stayin' real 'til I'm 6 feet deep
So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G

[2Pac:]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

[2Pac:]
Stuck on full, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life, heartless hustler
Just 'cause I fuck don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley
"Is it cool to fuck?" Is what I'm askin'
Bitch recognize game and started laughin'
Now I'm all in those guts and shit
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
'Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho
Lots of ho's get mad and shit
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
'Cause I doubt if I change, the game's a motherfucker
Real niggas turn to busters, Bury Me a G

[2Pac:]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
'Cause I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Say I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me

Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches, bitches hahaha


[Speaking:]
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine

[Slowed down voice:]
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin' problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin', joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Damn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
when she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Staring at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatching drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
[2x]

A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathing trying to keep from getting shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still running like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!


[2Pac:]
Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
'Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape 
'Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

[Eminem:]
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
'Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive

[2Pac:] And we continue growin', one day at a time

[Young Noble:]
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains the same

[Hussein Fatal:]
I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind

[2Pac:] And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn


[2Pac:]
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promised me emancipation in this new nation
All you ever gave my people was starvation
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my ancestors shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a damn thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting here mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

[Ray Luv:]
Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor take less
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
"Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star"
Panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

[2Pac:]
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community, they killed the unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of heart disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
'Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panther power

Panther power
Panther power
Panther power

[2Pac:]
As real as it seems the American Dream

[2Pac (?):]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
(You know what I am saying)
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's likeâ¦

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[2Pac:]
(It's on me), but still I'm having memories
Of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[2Pac:]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, "Again?" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died
I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying?
Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there ain't no coming back from that


All around the world, same song
All all around the world same song
[2x]

[Shock G:]
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing
Everybody's swinging in the place
As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long till I'm gone
It's just the same old song

[Humpty Hump:]
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kicking
Sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eating chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezing, but still I'm pleasing to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty, don't you know
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I don't go nowhere without my jim hat
If I'm rapping, cause she's clapping
Then I'm strapping cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song

All around the world, same song
All all around the world same song
[3x]

[Money B:]
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down
As a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak
So I'm draining entertaining, but I got fame
And the bases I touch too much for me trying to be naming
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and grinned
I busted in and I was Gone With The Wind
Clark Gable back in Oakland its the same old song
Sport these shorties, same freckles and hat
Drinking the same 40s

[Humpty Hump:]
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
Cause I'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
Here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump

[Shock G:]
Ah shut up and just listen
Not dissing don't get me wrong
But to me its just the same old song
So just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock
And you can't stop this
2Pac go ahead and rock this

[2Pac:]
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
Harass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(Claimin' fame, must have changed, now that we became strong)
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song

All around the world, same song
All all around the world same song
[3x]


[2Pac:]
Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world from another level
Ya know what I mean? Starin'â¦

[2Pac:]
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring
Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed
Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
They got me

[2Pac:]
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinking I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
Staring at the world through my rearview

[2Pac:]
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
Baby, let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

[2Pac:]
Now I know the answers to the question
"Do dreams come true?"
Still staring at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answers, "Do dreams come true?"
Staring at the world through my rearview

Nigga Kadafi say..

[Kadafi:]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
Cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
Something I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
So while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm staring through your rearview

[2Pac:]
Hahahaha, you ain't knowing what we mean by staring through the rearview, so since you ain't knowing what we mean let me break down understanding
The worldâ¦ the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is, then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do
Just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

[2Pac:]
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
[repeat 'til the end]


I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks
But no
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks
And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked
And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted
I put the nigga in his casket
Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce
And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
Got a 45 screamin' about survival
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo
Hollar "one-time" when I say so
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry
Even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
I'm str8 ballin'
Str8 ballin'
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'
It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'
Dressin' down like a villain, but only on the block
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hate to stip let my music bump
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
A need money in a major way
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCHHey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin'
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas
We str8 ballin'
Str8 ballin'
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die
I keep a pistol in my pocket
Ready on my block
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga
Better live your life to the fullest
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it
Cause even when they kill me
They can never take the game from a young G
We str8 ballin'
We str8 ballin'
To my niggas in the penitentiary
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born
And once again it's on
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse
I keep my glock cocked
I need it cause they're all shady
I finally made it
Now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack
And I came up a long way from food stamps
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs
And mothafucka, we be ballin'
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong
We str8 ballin'


[*gunshot*]
Yo Redd Spyder (ooh-wee) is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?
[*gun cocking*] Let me know, holla

[2Pac from the song "Smile":]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future

[50 Cent:]
Yeah nigga! Ha ha
Let's go nigga, this is what it is
2Pac cut his head bald
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (you PUSSY nigga!)
2Pac wear a bandanna
You wan' wear a bandanna
2Pac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo' back
Nigga you ain't 2Pac - THIS 2Pac!

[2Pac:]
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sitting in the cemetery
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitching
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumping warlike
Drop some shit, to any stupid bitches don't fight

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
'Til Makaveli returns, it's All Eyez On Me
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
oh
You shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see
[*click clack, gunshot*]

[50 Cent:]
Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nuttin left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (NOW) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck THE SOURCE, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone
(YOU PUSSY!)

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
'Til Makaveli returns, it's All Eyez On Me
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
oh
You shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see
[*click clack, gunshot*]


G-G-G-G-Unit!

[50 Cent (2Pac):]
'Til Makaveli returns, it's All Eyez On Me
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
oh
You shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see
[*click clack, gunshot*]

[*gunshot*]


[2Pac and Anya talking:]
Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up
(You know I got a man)
I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Please...
(Nah)
Oh aight â what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

[2Pac:]
Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations â would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate â but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?

Ebony, can you get away?
C'monâ¦ Let's goâ¦ Can you get away?
Can you get away?

[Anya Pinto (2Pac):]
So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)

[2Pac:]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
'Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
'Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care â that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?

[Anya Pinto (2Pac):]
So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I knowâ¦ is he beatin' on you?)
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

[2Pac:]
I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
'Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home â that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
'Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, 'cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
'Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?

[Anya Pinto (2Pac):]
So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

[2Pac:]
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need, but nowâ¦ he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
'Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good

[2Pac and Anya talking again:]
Can you take me from here?
Shake that man, get away
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I need to get awayyyheyyyeahhh


[2pac:]
You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
17 years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school
And scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated

[Reggie Green and "Sweet Franklin" (2Pac):]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[2pac:]
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, 'cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate
You just working with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated

[Reggie Green and "Sweet Franklin" (2Pac):]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

[2pac:]
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated

[Reggie Green and Sweet Franklin (2Pac):]
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady
Lady (Dear Mama)
Lady
Lady


[Child:] Why you by the window? What's wrong daddy?

[Mother:] I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day (there you go)
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't
You don't do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the- corner, anyday
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner

("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")

I see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
I no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
My homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin', please
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")

(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me, I was a G
And gettin' high was a way of bein' free; I see death around the corner

("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good.")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better.")
I see death around the corner

This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
("You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money
You fuckin hump?" - )
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right

[*movie samples*]
"If any of you.
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that." -

"I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!"
"I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!"

"I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
I want him dead, I don't care."


[2Pac:]
(Haha, what you say?)
Who you callin' rapist?
Ain't that a bitch
You devils are so two faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops again
Fuckin' with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that four-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!

[Shock G (2Pac):]
They tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up screamin' "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(Uh, I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They're tryna say that I don't care
(Just got up and screamed "Fuck the world!")

[2Pac:]
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' flex to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on yak as I sit back
Life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say, "You did that?"
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'
Fuck the world!

[Shock G (2Pac):]
They tryna say that I don't care
(Woke up screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(I got up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They're tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They're tryna say that I don't care

[2Pac:]
(Man, Fuck the world)
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
Cause I'm sittin' here sippin' on Guinness
Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!

[Shock G (2Pac):]
They tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(I got up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
(Haha, Fuck the world!)
(Fuck it)
(I hear my niggas screamin' "Fuck the world")

[2Pac:]
They wanna know if I claim the clique that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through hell and back and if I fail, black
Then it's back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggas is bustas, you runnin' round
With these tramp-ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!

[Shock G (2Pac):]
They tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up screamed "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care
(I woke up screamin' "Fuck the world!")
They tryna say that I don't care (They tryna say that I don't care)
(I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!")
Yeah what's goin on y'all?)

Uh, uh, uh. Fuck the world!

[Shock G singing:]
I don't care. I don't care, I don't care!

Oh, you Thug Life is yours?
Life ain't no something you can rap with
Ooh come no ordinary game
The game no something you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars.
Every time, seen?

[2Pac:]
Now how can I explain how this game laced me, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin' to make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin' they riches on skanless bitches, who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies since they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no broke nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game

[Ad-libs â Lady Levi (Eboni Foster):]
(Game's been good to me)
Who the bumba clat him a come try take mine?
Oh, me see you rushin' up (Game's been good to me)
I throw I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M
All, all the bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
Oh, that's right (I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)

[Richie Rich:]
(Well let me shoot some of this how heavy type of shit)
Certain niggas wanna stick to the game, you's a trick to the game
Waitin' upon your turn, son when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggas be twistin' and takin' shit
Puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one â check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be your own nigga meanin' buy your own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, something I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin' and robbin', despisin' your homie
Ain't healthy, niggas be endin' up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin' somethin' major
So what I reap is boss â that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin' residential
To a, young nigga workin' presidential

[Ad-libs â Lady Levi (Eboni Foster):]
(Game's been good to me)
Me nigga Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true I'm look good every time
Ooh, pussy war? Step up (Game's been good to me)
Can yi know I'm serving up blood claat
Playing yi fucking games
Ooh, we take game, we won!
(I don't care what it did to them)
Any by now
(the game's been good to me)
All, yi haffa forget fi we won!
Everytime

[2Pac:]
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
My decisions do or die, been hustlin' since junior high
No time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five shells
Cause life is hell, and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise
Them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
Shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news
Niggas confused, quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself
Go with the grain then, come into riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game

[Ad-libs â Lady Levi (Eboni Foster):]
(Game's been good to me)
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good everytime
When we at Beers Diamond
And 2Pac drives vintage car (Game's been good to me)
And fi them frame them look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!
(I don't care what it did to them)
( the game's been good to me)
Flush it! Oh!
Nobody wan come test me ya know
True them we a drive pretty car
Wanna no part of any ting
And now you wan come drown a gun
But ya see we know, you haffa show I'm maximum respect
For when a blood clat run or when a pussy walk up
We look good everytime
'Nough dollars, dollars!
Ya know about dollars, them right?
But we nah talk no shit
We haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?
'Cause action, action speak louder dan words
You n who the record partner
Don't blood claat ting at, ALL


A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once

They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, âcause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?

[2Pac + Dr. Dre:]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name
A different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight

[2Pac + Dr. Dre:]
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, .357's to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight

[2Pac + Dr. Dre:]
Nigga! If I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight
You know
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
"Tonight's the night I get in some shit"
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder
Kill, kill, kill, murder, murder, murder


[Ad-lib:]
Keepin' it real

I take a shot of Hennessy, now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of cess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggas on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change?
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain?
Arguments with my Boo, it's true
I spend mo' time with my niggas than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustlin' to make a mill-ion
Lord knows ain't no love for us ghetto children
So we cold, Rag-top slowin' down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin' like I'm hopeless
I can't cope me and the homies smokin' roaches
Cause we broke late night hangin' out 'til the sunrise gettin' high
Watchin' the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right... it ain't easy

...easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?

I can't sleep, niggas plottin' on me, kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin', cause I can hear them suckers schemin'
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin'
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this just the way it is
Even now lookin' out for these killa kids
Cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin'
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin' nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even though you're innocent you still a nigga, so they figure, rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life
Lickin' shots 'til I see my niggas free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
'Til I see my niggas free on the block, uh
It ain't easy

It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary?..

Lately been reminiscin'
'Bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
Just a project kid without a conscience, I'm havin' dreams
Of hearin' screams at my concerts
Me and all my childhood peers through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dolla
Sold my Impala cause these hard times make me wanna holla
Will I live to see tomorrow, am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin'
I can't go home 'cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin'
So now I'm in this high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
What, do I do in these county blues
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this, livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
Tryna torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation
And it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation
Meanwhile it ain't easy..
No it ain't easy

It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?


Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
Lord knows	
[*'Pac is choking on blunt smoke*]
Lord knows	
[*coughing harder*]
Lord knows	
[*one final cough*]

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they should've killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy
Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
Slangin' rocks with your Glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows	
[*coughing again*]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows	
[*still coughing*]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin' over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin' niggas, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard 
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe
Got me thinking, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And drive-by's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin' game
And Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows	
[*coughing again*]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows	
[*still coughing*]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

One-time! One-time!
Fuck the 5-0 cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let 'em capture me
Done lost too many niggas to this gangbangin'
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennessey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
Livin' every day, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...

(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows. Jesus.
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(He is listening! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

(Lord knows. Lord knows. He He. He. He. He.)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)


[2Pac:]
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[2Pac:]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is on top of me
The projects is full of bullets, though bodies is droppin'
They ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings
Leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath
More bodies being buried, I'm losin' my homies in a hurry
They're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me runnin', stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feeling this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use? Unless we're shootin' no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

[2Pac & Puff Johnson:]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

[Yaki Kadafi:]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin'
I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Everyday there's more death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm about to act up, go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in, and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

[2Pac & Puff Johnson:]
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby (11047986)

[2Pac:]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions,and those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game, it's just me against the world

[2Pac & Puff Johnson:]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game, it's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world (11047986)

[2Pac:]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it!


[2Pac:]
Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya know what I'm saying? Nothing but love for the old school
That's who were going do this one for, ya feel me?

[Grand Puba sample:]
"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way."
[5x]

[2Pac:]
I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL, Raising Hell, but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
and Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill getting ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal. Remember Raw, with Daddy Kane?!
when De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
had me puffin on that Buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember "Push It" was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school

[Grand Puba sample:]
"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way."

[2Pac:]
I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playing skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
I remember. Way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling
Cus the hoochies was starin, thinking, "What them niggas wearing?"
I'm wondering if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, humpin hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sipping 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

[Grand Puba sample:]
"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way."

[2Pac:]
Remember popping and locking to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di
Gaming the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties
I remember, breakdancing to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nothing like the old school!

[Grand Puba sample:]
"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way."

[2Pac:]
Haha, on the real though
Remember seeing Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfucking party?
Remember motherfuckers used to go, "Is Brooklyn in the house?"
And motherfuckers would lose they God Damn Mind!
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Super, Sperm)
I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say
they was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfucking old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knocking niggas out the box, popping boxes?
Remember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?
Remember the block-- 'Member screaming up at your moms from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as HELL...)
The ice cream truck, remember all the mother--
'Member the Italian Ices, yo? Yo, remember the Italian Ices?!
The Spanish Niggas comin' down with the coconut ices and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT!


[2Pac (RahRah):]
That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
(Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw)
That's right nigga, hahaha. Housin' these hoes, you feel me?
(Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?)
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
(Keepin' it real!)
How old are you nigga?
(I'm eleven)

[2Pac:]
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryin' to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
and snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

[2Pac:]
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
"Motherfuckers is crooked," is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

[Dramacydal:]
[Kadafi:]
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest
[Kastro:]
So I just... swallow my Beck's and holla, "Fuck 'em!"
And if I'm next... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nuttin'
[EDI Amin (Kastro):]
Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin'
(now he mashin') Top speed (smokin' weed) laughin' (biotch!)
[Napoleon:]
Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout prayin'
[Kadafi:]
They need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block
[Napolean:]
Tryin' to take my wealth

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggas run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin' but music
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
but all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real ill
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin' bastards
I never die, thug niggas multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all, my nigga RahRah!


I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God! I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- shed so many tears

Lord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...
Lord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears...
God! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears


[Sample:]
Hey! Hey-ayyaahhyy

[2Pac:]
Yo Mo Bee mayn! Drop that shit!
You know what time, boo-yaow, I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'
And uh, throw up that finger
Ayo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?

[2Pac:]
Tell me baby are you lonely?
Don't wanna rush ya, I can help ya if ya only
Let me touch ya, if I'm wrong love tell me
'cause I get caught up, and the life I live is Hell see
I never thought I'd see, the day when I would calm down
You ain't heard, I've been known to clown and Get Around
That's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good
Yes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match right?
Don't be phony, 'cause I hate when you act like
You don't know me I've be stressin' in the spotlight
I want the fame, but the industry's a lot like
A crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
(Look here) I wanna be an honest man
But temptations go

[2Pac:]
Throw up the finger! And all my homies go
Throw them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like

[Easy Mo Bee:]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

[2Pac:]
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in
Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin'
I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'
And to God, gotta keep myself from fall-in
But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure
What do I do, gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up
And say it's cool, should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper
Some dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya
On every curve, slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was

[2Pac:]
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like

[Easy Mo Bee:]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

[2Pac:]
A lotta people think it's easy
To settle down, got a woman that'll please me
In every town, I don't wanna but I gotta do it
The temptation got me ready to release the fluid Sensation, sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

[2Pac:]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
You know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

(Everybody, hey, alright
Hey, heyyyeah, heyyyayy, oh)

All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give em the finger!


I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sandifer
And all other lil' Young Niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a Young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind
Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a mill-ion, can you blame me?
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin'
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As Young Niggas

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
(As a strung nigga)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(Strung nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitches cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
(As a young nigga)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(young nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known

[Ad-lib:]
I'm tellin' you
...to be young, have your brains and have every limb and all that
Yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin'
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my Young Niggas
Break away from these dumb niggas
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin'
Puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for Young Niggas

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
(for the young niggas)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(this for nigga.., this for the young nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known

[Collision over the last 4 lines:]
This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
Them niggas that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)
Young motherfuckin' hustlers (make that money boy)
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
You know what I'm sayin'? (Go to school nigga, go to school)
Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
You could be a lawyer (really doe)
Niggas gotta get they priorities straight
(Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker)
Really doe. Young Niggas. little RahRah
(sup nigga) Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
(Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, Young Niggas)


[2Pac:]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?"
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change... and that's the way it is

[Talent:]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

[2Pac:]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
'Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids
"I gotta get paid!", well hey, but that's the way it is

[Talent:]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

[2Pac talking:]
We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't working
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

[2Pac:]
And still I see no changes
Can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" That's the way it is

[Talent:]
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

[2Pac:]
Some things'll never change


[2Pac:]
Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
That's right bwoy, it's goin on, right here
Thug Life
God bless the dead

[2Pac:]
God bless the dead, and buried
Nigga, don't worry if you see God first
Tell him shit got worse, I ain't mad
I know you representin the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models - gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

[2Pac:]
God bless the dead [4x]

[2Pac:]
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook, all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police and all the courts, same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

God bless the dead [4x]

[2Pac:]
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin G's, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggy

[Stretch:]
Yo Big, this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z
Sendin they respect, yaknowhatImean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that

I pray before I go to sleep - "Dear God"
Say my grace before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm droppin to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin so I'm flowin goin crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin you, yes
The Teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

[Stretch:]
God bless the dead [4x]


[2Pac:]
I ain't got no motherfucking friends
That's why I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker
Take Money
West Side, Bad Boy killers
Take Money
You know who the realest is
We bring it too
Take money, take money

[2Pac:]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy trying to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Caesar go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace! I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night haha
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[2Pac:]
See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, oh
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up

[2Pac:]
Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't know why I'm even on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'm going to let my little homies ride on you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches
Take money

[Hussein Fatal:]
Get out the way, yo, get out the way, yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo' pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for setting traps
Little accident-murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm serving ya
Spank you, shank your whole style when I gank
Guard your rank cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm running through, nigga
And I'm smoking Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready-power
Tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour
I hit 'em up

[2Pac:]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, oh
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up

[2Pac:]
Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas getting killed with your mouths open
Trying to come up off of me, you in the clouds hoping
Smoking dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talking about you getting money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas living bummy â why you fucking with me?
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air haha
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I'll hit 'em up

[Kadafi:]
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees
Copping pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click looting, shooting and polluting your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw Mafia clique moving up another notch
And your Pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass east coast props
Brainstormed and locked

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Jui-cer
You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke. We ain't no motherfucking joke
Thug Life, niggas better be known
Be approaching in the wide open, gun smoking
No need for hoping, it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is bopping off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

[2Pac:]
Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run haha
They don't wanna see us
Take money
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressing up trying to be us
Take money
How the fuck they gonna be the mob when we always on our job? We millionaires
Killing ain't fair, but somebody got to do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep: you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or something?
You're fucking with me, nigga
You fuck around and catch a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that want to bring it:
Bring it!
But we ain't singing, we bringing drama
Fuck you and your motherfucking mama
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers
Now when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a mother fucking opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this:
Fuck Mobb Deep, fuck Biggie, fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label and as a motherfucking crew!
And if you want to be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL: fuck you too!
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
(Take money, take money)
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you; die slow, motherfucker
My .44 make sure all y'all kids don't grow!
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life-riders, Westside til we die!
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfucker! We do our job!
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob
Ain't nothing but killers and the real niggas
All you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
Take money
You niggas laugh cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckin' belts
You know how it is, when we drop records they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy-killers
We killers, we killers, we killers


[2Pac:]
How long will they mourn me?
Yeah, this for my nigga Kato
It's still on, nigga, believe that!
We live a Thug Life, thugs for life, ha ha
(How long will they mourn me?)
We handle this shit for you, boy
Yeah, nigga, 2Pac in this motherfucker

[2Pac:]
All my homies drinkin' liquor, tears in everybody's eyes
Niggas cried to mourn a homie's homicide
But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier?
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckers back before you're buried
Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me? Bury me a motherfuckin' G
Bitch, don't wanna die, then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic 
When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me though, I'm tryin' hard to make amends
But I'm losin' all my motherfuckin' friends
Damn! They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the motherfuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me?

[Nate Dogg (2Pac):]
I wish it would have been another
(How long will they mourn me?)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Half them niggas all dead and shit)
(How long will they mourn me?)
I wish it would have been another
(Dedicated this to Kato, nigga, and e'ry thug)
(How long will they mourn me?)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Yo, nigga, we gotta keep this shit goin' on; yo, Syke!)

[Big Syke:]
How long will they mourn me? Every motherfuckin' day, homie
You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigger you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without you, nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'Lac
And goin' half on a motherfuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me, Lord, why you take big Kato?
So confused not knowin' which way to go
I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day, ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
'Til we meet again, homie â how long will they mourn me?

[Nate Dogg (Big Syke):]
I wish it would have been another. Big Kato.
(How long will they mourn me? It's still on, nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(How long will they mourn me?)
I wish it would have been another
(How long will they mourn me?)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mac 10)

[The Rated R (Double Jeopardy):]
Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad, I'm tired of puttin' in work
I'm tired of cryin', watchin' my homies leave the Earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is, "That's fucked up."
And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now, let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of you, homie
Rest in peace â how long will they mourn me?

[Macadoshis (Mac 10):]
We know life's a fuckin' trip, and everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato?
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy, it's fuckin' with my dome
You only live once on this Earth
A nigga had it bad since the day of my motherfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone, how long will you mourn me?

[Nate Dogg (2Pac):]
I wish it would have been another
(Mac 10 in this motherfucker, yeah!)
(How long will you mourn me?!)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(Thug Life, boy, Nate, blowin' that shit)
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg, do that shit, nigga, yeah)
(How long will you mourn me?!)
How long will they mourn my brother?
(This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
(How long will you mourn me?!)
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn my brother?


Troublesome, nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfucking-96
(Westside!) Let it be known, nigga!
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land
Underhanded hits are planned
These Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my "bitch nigga eater"
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in my physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

[2Pac:]
Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screaming, "Fuck all ya'll niggas!" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-by's
Murder my foes, can't control my 9
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive; ran up on his ass
When I dumped he died, 'cause I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

[2Pac:]
Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck â I'm hopeless
I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby
I'm troublesome, haha
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw â Outlaw!

"Murder murder" my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme â the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga, "Either stop or die"
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm having crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, 'cause I ain't begging for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Hahahaha â I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesomeâ¦ like my nigga Napoleon said, nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the Boss of all Bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Amin, Hussein Fatal
Kadafi, Kastro, Napoleon, Po-Nitty
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around
Haha, we Troublesome
Ayo, haha, we Troublesome, I ain't going, HA HAH
Young Kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash
Going for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas! Outlawz! Ha hah!
Khadafi â trump tight, never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it going on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, all you niggas die
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

â¦bye bye, bye bye, all you niggas dieâ¦


(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love

Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare and share with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurtin'
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditional love

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
[2x]

Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies
Cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make something out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
[2x]

I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while getting paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everything gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thing, baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love

[Repeat to fade:]
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love


[Eminem:] 
In my mind I'mma fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
[2x]

[2Pac:]
Follow me tell me if you feel me 
I think niggas is trying to kill me
Picturing pistols, spitting hollow points 'til they drill me 
Keeping it real, and even if I do conceal 
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keeping steel 
See niggas is false, sitting in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches 
I'm trying to be strong, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone, bitches be warned
Word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm busting on Guiliani, he rubbing my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me 
I'm spitting at punk bitches and hustling to be free 
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes 
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo

I was raised by drunks, so I became a drunk.
80 Proof for this rocker, that's the name I want.
Or the aisle in the back, bump a seven deuce.
See that top on that 40, you know it's comin' loose.
See me on the Av. daily, we runnin' this shit.
If your chick get loud, I g-money that bitch.
Packin mags and clips, I'll smash your clique.
Because of Proof they put the "G" in the alphabet.

[Eminem] I'm the devil. if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting
I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor

[Eminem] Outro Shoutouts


[2Pac:]
Ah shit hahaha
When I enter the first zone Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My Prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's none left
Don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)

[Nutso:]
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn't talk, bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder, I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder, so sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin' In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills, positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the Lex Ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly, kill and execute 'em

[Yaki Kadafi:]
I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga, nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way outs for easy exits
Don't sleep

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)

[Lil' Scrappy:]
G's up
A-Town
When I hit the street, all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear, when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose, then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What ever you do shawty you better think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll never be
Yeah I'ma keep it g I'm from the Three and Scrap will never sleep
Aye

We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
Don't sleep

Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everybody, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop haters
Here goin' against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too loud it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em

[Young Noble:]
Listen it ain't no stoppin' I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double
Try to stop it and touch it
I'ma cock it and bust it
Niggas fuck it I'm tryna get it addicted to fast livin'
Get rich or die tryin' nigga ask 50
I've been Operatin' Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government
Washed around by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screamin' Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Givin' my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all goin' through the struggle
Penny pinchin'
It's like you really ain't livin'
Resultin' on a 211âs, I'm cookin' in the kitchen
Like we lookin' and we wishin'
Prayin' will he hear it?
It's eatin' at my spirit
Speakin' for the spirits

[2Pac:]
You can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop

[Young Noble:]
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not

I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'

[Hussein Fatal:]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
If God strike me with lightnin', I'm shootin' him back
Skinny cause I won't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm, fuck the world 'til I'm gone
I'm buckin' at Corey Brooke he treatin' my niggas wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks duckin' from the penitentiary

[Yaki Kadafi:]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong pop too long gone
And now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my throne pow like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Livin' life as a Don, guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton

[Hussein Fatal:]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearin' Red I'ma rock the green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the fifth

(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!

[Young Noble:]
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down

This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hidin' me my nigga
Make a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stoppin' me my nigga
It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chillin' like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies, sharpen they miss
So when you see me they can give me a kiss
The one posin' with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin' a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm puttin' in work
Not an easy you wanna jerk
Call me squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlaw, Makaveli nigga ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggas what they screamin' at night
But Big Syko with the thug in your life

[E.D.I. Mean:]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep goin' (Keep goin')
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rollin' (Keep rollin')
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we livin' the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sittin' clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

[Young Noble & Stormy:]
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down

[Carl Thomas:]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

[2pac:] 
Murderous mind state, can't keep my 9 straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labeled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs
Commence to lettin' off rounds, then escape in a fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My Mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin'
Uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
"Bomb first" my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies; I'm dumpin'

[Hussein Fatal:] 
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some Uptown Anthem shit
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' out my bedroom, I ain't there
.40 cal's, extended clips, still I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different, and I'ma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket
Or doing life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin', you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walking dead, angel spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant, like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put the Twin Towers up
Pac, I'm knockin' them back down
Poster child cheque, Air Force Ones
With the crooked dial checks, I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the 9 and the shovel

Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

[Papoose:] 
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box, 'cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know you're goons
That's why I keep pressure on them, like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin'
Songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'âI'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had
When I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pacâthe revolution

[Carl Thomas:]
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

Everybody talkin' 'bout Pac's life
(Outlawz) 

[2Pac:]
Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million 
Hit the charts like a mad man nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
Dodgin' cop cars look how we come so far
Picture a high school drop out 
Rollin' a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank 
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me can't
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change 
It comes with the fame 
Watch them gossip in this silly game 
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night 
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life? 
To all y'all niggas, conversating on my life
Mind your motherfucking business 

[Ashanti:]
Pac's life

[T.I:]
I remember that 
Ay

Yeah I know we never got to meet 
But we know all the same people so we got to speak 
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G 
And all the shit you went through 
Meant a lot to me 
But when they locked you up for nothing it was shame to see
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me 
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be 
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see 
Now they all in the court room blaming me 
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle 
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's 
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em 
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's 
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's 
With the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

[2Pac:]
I want money in large amounts 
My garage full of cars that bounce 
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts 
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump 
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary 
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass 
Nigga you scary, I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers, in Junior High
I was itching' to kill, and you was, 'Ready To Die'
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases 
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places 
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried 
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'mma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfucker's die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga it's how it is
Only real niggas stay on top 

[Ashanti:]

Never figured that, that same nigga'd sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodging cop cars look at how we come so far
Picture high school dropout rollin' the double R
House full of happiness weed and drink
Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change
It comes with the fame
Why we gossip in the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speaking down on me -
This is the night, why is everybody caught up in Pac's Life
To all ya'll niggas, conversatin' on my life

[Snoop Dogg:]
When we first hung out together, I met you with the homie
We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on Wilshire in the penthouse suites
Had my lil' cousin Daz hook you up with some beats
It was Outlaw, Dogg Pound, Death Row Records, man we tore up the town
Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told Suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'All Eyez On You'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted'
And our relationship was genuine
Wanna know how I know about Pac's Life? Cause was a friend of mine

[Snoop Dogg:]
Pac's Life (Yeah, uh huh)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life (And you ain't even know the homie)
But what do you know about Pac's Life? (What you know about Pac's Life?) Yeah

[T.I.:]
Ey, what's happening Pac' yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got the speed
You taught me first -- fate nigga can't stop a G
And all that shit you went through meant a lot to me
Watching you locking up with him, was a shame to see
You know crack in the business did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas, it's a lane to be
Talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
Well so I'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
Now they all in the court room, blamin' me
See we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
Power to the real nigga and death to the sucker
Money over bitches get to know 'em before you love 'em
Death before dishonor never talk to army trouble
Live by the same rules, so my wrist's tattooed
With the same sorta' dude, with the same short fuse

[Snoop Dogg:]

[2pac:] 
Another shady mission
Tricks, like watching pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love making, take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know
I live the life of a thug nigga until the day I go
No broken promises, a sacred bond broken
I know I die alone, but yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in Heaven, 'cause being here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy
Still, looking for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

[Keyshia Cole:]
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who Be The One Who Be There 
Through The Thick And Thin 
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

[Keyshia Cole:] 
No one else can do what you do for me
Take me away from the pain I feel inside
And it's gonna be alright and it'll be OK
If We Try And Take Our Time 
Yes, baby, take our time
And we'll grow, trust I know
I wanna be the one whoâ¦

[Keyshia Cole:]
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

[2Pac (Keyshia Cole):]
You got to play your cards right on one (Oh, yeah)
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'? (No, no, no)
If you be patient, and you take your time (Be patient, baby)
And you finesse it, 9 times out of 10 times (10)
Homeboy, you gon' wake up with your breakfast in bed
But if you rush and you just be manhandlin'
Ha-ha (Hey, it takes a real man)
Your ass is going home tonight, ha-ha (Hey)
Play your cards right, nigga, take your time (Be the one)
Be patient (Be the one, hey)
Go slow, it's better that way, you ain't heard? (Yeah)
Ha-ha, play your cards right (Be the one, I wanna be the one)

[Keyshia Cole:]
I wanna be the one who
Who you can depend on who
Who be the one who be there
Through the thick and thin
Go by the water we will
Be there 'til the morning
We won't leave until the night
And we will be forever more

[2Pac (Keyshia Cole):]
Take your time, man (Take your time)
Don't be in such a rush (In a rush)
Ha-ha (Be forever more)
You got to be patient, man, be patient
It ain't going nowhere one, ha-ha (Nowhere)
Get some champagne (Ha-ha, be forever more)
Bring some roses or somethin', you know
Play some soft shit, light a fire (Luther Vandross)
You got to be cool with it (Teddy, Teddy)
You got to be slow with it (Oh, be so)
You got to be patient, you got to play your cards right on one
Can't be rushing like it's a race, nomsayin'?
If you be patient, and you take you time and you finesse it


[2Pac:]
This going out to all the females that be having
To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them
Off of them, Ha-ha

[2Pac:]
Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision

[Ludacris:]
Uh huh, Luda
You ain't gotta do that baby
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin' your cards
You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue
Ha-ha, play your cards right baby

[Keyon Bryce (2pac):]
Play your cards right baby (ha-ha, play your cards right)
Play your cards right girl (take ya time)
Take your time baby (be patient)
Just be patient baby (don't rush)

Baby, I'm hopin' that you understand, that you still believe
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin' that you see
Baby that the thug in me is lovin' you, that this is meant to be
Girl I'll never leave you alone

[2Pac talking:]
Fuck all these motherfucker's talking all this old bullshit
Like niggas just gonna accept that old trash ass shit
We ain't having none of this old shit
These niggas about to come up straight short
Cause we about to get buck wild on you motherfucker's

Prepare for the wrath, a psychopath when this song play
Get iller than Johnny Gill, then rub you the wrong way
Fuck sensitivity I get cruel when you're doing me
Cause none of the rough stuff bitch stop pursuing me
So true to the game, it's a name you don't dare say
A lyrical lunatic when I kick it you're scared straight
Motherfucker's fall pray to the roster
You step any closer and get hit with a dose of
The iller-fied pimping-ass gang to bang to
And I ain't ashamed to, get wicked with slang too
Niggas know, when I flow, I can give you mo'
Get sicker than psycho, and won't let the Mic, go
'Til I hear the whole crowd on they two feet
As I go through new beats, I'm running through MCs
Nigga please you dizzy, you can't take me
You stumble through break beats but you'll never fade me
Scared straight cause you hate, when I motivate
You suffer a different fate, with music I mutilate
But some of the super suckers try to stop me
I'm gunning and running the stupid motherfuckers now they jock me
What if I should trip? Or chill and a give fair break
Fuck it they feel the wrath of a motherfucker scared straight

You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (Ah, yeah, scared straight)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (When your heart's beating)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head

Feel the 'Fever In The Funk House' buster you'll get rolled on
No matter how much they bring, I duck and dodge and hold on
Best a watch the swing
Nigga the game is so strong, catch me by surprise
You won't realize your ho's gone
Nigga I'm on the creep
And if I know your address, girls as good as stuck
She eating my Mr. Badness
Pac don't give a fuck, I got too many enemies
Fucking with the ginger juice the booze of fucking Hennessy
The closer they can get
But still don't let them see me sweat, suckers ain't trying to step
They know they'll be breathing they last breath
Niggas ain't got no heart, but swear that they be rocking shit
'Til they get a load of the bold ass 2Pacalypse
Tell them to bring the noise, and look like they wanna rift
Brother this is ain't a game, a crook's what's you're fucking with
Hitting him with the flurry, I'll bury him if he steps to me
Suckers can't get next to me, tripping off some Ecstasy
Literal life insanity, even a form of suicide
This ain't BBD, try doing me you're do or die
Dropping them like a Mack, and smacking them like a weak bitch
nigga don't even twitch
Cause them I'mma have to pull the switch
Victory to the switch, so fuck 'em if they, try to break
Freaking 'em with the funk left them drunk
Hella scared straight
Hell yeah
Scared straight

You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (Ah, yeah, scared straight)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (When your heart's beating)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
[4x]

This 2Pacalypse in this motherfucker
And I'm scared straight
My motherfucker partners in the house


[2Pac:]
Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on

[2Pac:]
Pictures of penny, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semiâautomatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, itâs fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep

[2Pac:]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Young Buck:]
I'm starin' through my rear view, doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin' down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
And now they scare, they know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us, we ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on niggas

[2Pac:]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Chamillionaire:]
They say that the mo' they hate ya the mo' that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind, my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

[2Pac:]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Don't go to sleep nigga)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Sleep baby)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep


[2Pac:]
Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm living just to die
I'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waiting for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder "How long will I last?"
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Busters are shady, so I'm dumping on cowards
Crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of making these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood, soon as I get home

[2Pac:]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

[2Pac:]
Sittin' here looking at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is "Keep it real or you can die squealin'."
Plus I never had to worry 'bout a visit
âCause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissing, steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscing, everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war, but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on, soon as I get home

[2Pac:]
Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Let's get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

[Yaki Khadafi:]
Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinking big, like the kid from Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams, like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and mama surviving
Depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wanting me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results living bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that should've been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waiting by the phone
Hoping I'll get a call telling a nigga that you home

[2Pac:]
Grab the gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home
[repeats until end]


[2Pac talking:]
You motherfuckers kill me
Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?
Hahaha
Yall niggas get a lot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic
Well do this for me, would you?
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga
or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas saying something on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'

[*Beat starts*]

[2Pac:]
Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds 
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

[2Pac:]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
[2x]

[Gravy:]
Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smoking on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AKs, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

[Yaki Kadafi:]
I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin' drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranhas or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure

[2Pac:]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
[2x]

[Hussein Fatal:]
I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me, "I can guarantee you a boss."
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still struggling like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect

[2Pac:]
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
[2x]

[2Pac:]
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlawz! We untouchable!

[Krayzie Bone:] 
You niggas better not try to run up 
And don't try to say we ain't told ya
You're dealin' with killers and soldiers
Nigga, these explosives, tryin' to blow shit
Runnin' you over, nigga, controller
Whenever y'all niggas try to roll up 
Thinkin' I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya
I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia 
Dumpin' so potent, nigga, don't choke up
Flow up, Makaveli the Don
Got niggas strapped and ready to bomb
As soon as I send the alarm
And when we're done, we've committed a red rum
Leavin' the enemies dead and gone
Leavin' them niggas head's blown
'Cause they know they dead wrong
When the shots ring out, you know we're comin' through
Talk a lot with your mouth, well, what you gon' do?
Shut 'em down, busters be knowin'
To keep they distance, thugs don't fuck around
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground 
Slug in a nigga mug, reppin' Midwest Side
Niggas, if you a thug, get your weapon, let's ride
Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac
Pop off the Glock, Glock, the thuggin', it don't stop

Y'all remember me, legendary, live eternally
Bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace
'Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face
Then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfuckers at a rate, and then quicken the pace
Blast me, but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on 'til I die?
Now I'm worldwide; niggas gossip like girls, then hide
No offense to Nas, but this whole fuckin' world is mine
Even if you blind, you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me 
Fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
Can you feel me, dreamin'? Seein' scenes of me ballin'?
Fuck you bitch-made niggas
And that bullshit you goin' through
Outlaws bustin' while we rushin', we untouchable

[2Pac:]
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Now what's next 
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Now what's next 

[2Pac:]
Caught up in the middle 
My life's a riddle 
Don't let it get ya 
I wanna be legal 
But it's this hustle that get me richer 
One love to my peoples makin' money 
I can see you bubblin' 
Avoid all trouble 
Beware of devils continue strugglin' 
Nothing's impossible if there's a will there's a way 
So get your mind on official business 
You can be great 
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave 
So get paid 
My niggas do this every fuckin' day
We parlay 
Through politics and conversation 
This information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation 
Separation is self destruction 
What's needed is unification 
Cause the world ain't hardly scared 
If not prepared 
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there 
But no one cares it's there to share 
All we get is stares 
Because of fear we'll evaporate 
Say your prayers 

And what's next 

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Whatz next
Hard livin' got me goin' insane 
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game 
Whatz next 
I'm goin' crazy 
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Whatz next 
[2x]

[A3:]
(Aye its on A3) 
Makaveli tried to warn us 
But niggas ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac 
Shit yean got it yet (no) 
Then you won't get it 
Might as well measure 'em up 
And have his ass fitted 
Why 
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game 
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane 
Never will change niggas wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change 
I stay posted like a flag (flag) 
Starin' through my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag) 
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town 
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now 
Time foe a change 
Real niggas rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets 
Side track by the broads and the frauds 
Ain't it strange 
It's the reason so many niggas get scarred in the game
What's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Whatz next
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do

[2x]

[Jay Rock:]
That money gotta make it 
What I gotta do to make it 
Do I really gotta take it 
Put this mack up to you, face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive 
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by 
Some niggas stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes 
What the fuck we suppose to do 
Who gon' give us a job 
So I tried and tried 
Tried to get out the grind 
But the block kept on callin' me back 
Fiends kept on callin' for crack 
So I supply 'em wit' that 
Gave 'em a reasonable fee 
Nigga don't blame it on me 
Shit just look where I'm at 
Niggas in gardens
LAPD is the target 
Niggas is heartless hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment 
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet 
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet 
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin 
What's next

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Whatz next
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
Whatz next
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Whatz next

[Intro: Angela McClosky]
I brought you something close to me
And left with something new
See through your head
You haunt my dreams
Nothing to do but believe
Just believe

[Verse: Ab-Soul]
And please don't confuse me with dog, I'm different
Long Term Mentality, still remember them cheap wood benches
How could I ever forget, I never could get
How niggas couldn't get up and get all they could get
Man I done seen a thing or two of things that she or he will do
To fit in with each other nitpicking at each other
Killing each other, bringing each other down
Crustations in a bucket, fuck it
Roll your windows down in your bucket, play this loud
Soul brother number fucking two
My time on these 1's and 2's
I'm on this track like running shoes
I dedicate this one to Cletus Anderson for working harder than the average man
Or bend over backwards for his family
Doing whatever is you ask for him
Shit, I know he fucking tired
He should be somewhere retired
Still trying, bills still due
And between me and you until we get a mill
Life smells like mildew

[Hook: Ab-Soul and Pat Brown]
Long term (This is long term!)
Long term (I'll help you suckas, cause I take it long term)
Long term (I came, I saw, and conquered)
Mentality, mentality, long term (And it's an honor)
Long term (To share this with you, wait no longer)
Long term (Mother fucker this is long term)
Mentality, mentality, long term


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I know exactly how it is to feel like no one cares
About the hard work you put in but who said life was fair?
It sure wasn't me I take the bitter with the sweet
And boil it in the pot make it hard to eat
I said If I'm going to play I'm going to play for keeps
Raise stakes, take stage, speak my peace
Make my pay, take my lady on a date
Send my parents on a cruise - living
Somewhere with a killer view
Oh the irony I spew
But for now the studio couches gonna have to do
I ain't going to take what I ain't earned myself
Foolish pride
That's what you need to survive
It's do or die
So step aside I don't mean no trouble
Just want to be someone that CJ could look up to
Oh, and just so you know
When I'm on the road I'm at the travel lodge not the W

[Hook: Ab-Soul & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Almost there, almost there, almost there
The finish line is in sight but I'm almost there
Almost there, almost there
Almost there, almost there, almost there
Even if the sun don't shine the sun don't shine
Almost

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Somebody asked me, what you mean by longterm mentality, actually?
So I had to break it down:
Don't get caught up in the now
Focus on the years abroad
Cause today you're here but tomorrow you could be gone
Singing the same old song
And who's the place to blame on?
Other than you
Whatever it is you do
From slanging eight balls to graduating from school
Just gotta see it all before it happens
I ain't saying see a psychic I'm just saying have a
Idea of what you're accomplishing
You'll have a greater chance to accomplish it
You know a little strategy, premeditation
Wins races nine times out of ten
As if losing's ever an option
Had to bust my own bubble I really thought I was poppin'
(Not quite)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Just know your future's right around the corner
Opportunity galore for ya
More and more you'll start to see it's no limit to what you can be
In any event, eventually
Treat your first like your last time
Cause it might be your last time
That's what I learned last time
Look forward to looking forward in my pastime
You just letting time pass like "that's fine", as wine
Contrary to popular belief, I want the peace
They say I'm headed hellbound at God's speed
Gazunteight, or bless me if you like
As I, put my faith in this bud and budlight
I've been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
Talk my shit, drop my load on
Hold on, I don't think you know how close I am
By the time this song's done I'm already there


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Before I exit out this motherfucker, bet you know my name
I'm into Swisher Sweets and five dollar champagne
You should join my campaign before I lose my damn brain
I'm chasing a winning and I don't know if I'm losing or winning
Damn shame
Shit, I ain't complaining
It's no limits nigga, it's only entertainment
So I'm in the Bugatti and got the burner too
Right place, right time, I'll murder you
Huh, I finally get it
What's the use in being witty ain't nobody wit' it
I'd rather sticky my woody in a wonder woman
So good I might never want another one
But I'mma always want another woman
Real nigga to the core my dude
Straight from the liquor store
From getting more sippy from me and my recipients
Till we stumble to the floor my dude, straight off top
T.D.E. till 3003
No scratch that, I can't calculate that exact
My downfall will probably never be an incident though
Use your mind, don't just listen to the instrumental
Read the signs before you end up in a pile of shit
You probably did
The least you can do is crack a window
You smell that?
And if I catch him taking a nap, I tell him that...

[Hook]
I hope it hit you like a bus done run up into ya
I'm only fuckin' with ya
I know it's nothing to ya
What I gotta make is something to ya
Slept on us long enough, you got it coming to ya

[Verse 2: MURS]
See me I'm from the mid, don't fuck with the kid
Heavy artillery, this long will split your wig
Put your fitted on the curb
You know, rip your lid
Brains on the sidewalks you know what it is, that is
I got that strict mentality
Razorblade in my mouth, Bitch wanna battle me
Huh? I slice this bitch up, I ain't playin
Snare need stitches from the words that I'm sayin'
Name my badem, Reppin' L.A.'n
Tattoo's showin', mean muggin' at the way in
Smack you with a bottle that I picked up on the way in
And them niggas that rollin' with you only with you cause you pay 'em
And real niggas don't get extorted
We call for the mother ship, then we board it
That mean we fly like we wanna fly
Me and Ab comin' for you, better go runnin' high

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Look, I'm really sick, you need to quit
Like quiet without the E
Supplyin' the D-man's
Sometimes it gets deep man
You will die in the deep end
Surviving to see it
And I'mma be here, The bible is re-writ
HiiiPower, you can yell it
But make sure it's three it's when you spell it
I'm at the bottom of the barrel, let them niggas tell it
I might have to put the barrel to a niggas melon
Pull up on a few hoes in the new McLaren
Back to the condo, condom broke, now I'm a parent
Still smilin' in the mirror, nigga here to think
Everybody got it comin' to 'em, even me
You only reap what you sow
You only get what you knit
My garden's grown, and I'm about to throw a fit


[Intro: Ab-Soul]
As we proceed to give you what you need, T-D-E

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q & Ab-Soul]
Omega, Black Hippy came through to switch flavors
Wake and bake no taters
Pa-pass me the ketchup I'll homestyle fry em'
You niggas better catch up as swift as I am
I was born in Zion
I defeated the Lion, soul made of iron
Yeah, Soul made of iron
Now a nigga talking, now you can't fold when you trying
Try for triumph
Survive by any means necessary even if it means dying
Dying! Fuck the world missionary, Malcom got popped
Obama got in office, and I'm still on the block
Ain't shit changed,the grinding never stops
Call it progress, and the reason why the chicks always fall in our nest
Two niggas getting high
Heh! Flying objects. Hehehaha! Yes!
We got next, now forever the hippy is black interrogated by (By!)
Instrumentals that give me a rhythm
Put the maze together and blaze
Don't be afraid, (Aye), See this is how we do
Would say I thought you knew but that would not be true
In fact, Be Q
You fags are through and like all of you teachers thus far
I'm passing you (Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh)

[Hook: Ab-Soul & Schoolboy Q]
Black Hippy! Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
Soul!
Black Hippy, Black-bla-b-b-bl-Black Hippy
(yeh) Black-bla-b-b-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-bla-b-b-b-Black Hippy
Please fix ya face, we rolling up so much, anticipation
We finna shock the nation, Oh Shit! Constipation!
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches fuck hoes
Fuck bitches (We finna shock the nation) fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, (Constipation)fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes
Fuck bitches, fuck hoes, fuck bitches, fuck hoes (As we proceed)

[Verse 2: Jay-Rock & Kendrick Lamar]
Activist
(black hippy) Rebel without a cause
Full clip left you stiff like a manikin
Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal, What you on
I'm on some other shit, feeling like I stepped off the mother ship
We sabotage the government, CIA gotta evacuate when we done
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run
It's going down I said
Boogie down, down
Boogie down Bronx
In a black borrow hound
Bumping Biggie like
Pac ain't dead
Two side call it Twenty-two (Ugh)
I'm twenty-two and I rap like twenty zoos
Straight animal
Ace Ventura couldn't find no cure
So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
Protein shakes, acid, and manure

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
I feel like, I'm affiliated with, the illuminati, bitch
All seein' fuckin eye (I), this is your enlightenment
I'm lightin' this, fire my supplier always like to give
Higher than I've ever been these heights are mighty frightening
Throw ya hands up as if you wanna strike like lightening
Don't shoot, you can't fight a viking on vicodin
Can you? Hmmmm I would like to see you try it then
I be eatin' rappers that's the only way I'm bitin' them
That was yummy yummy, dummy dummy, nothing's funny funny
Give a bitch a sippy sippy, then I get some sucky sucky
Sucky sucky now, think the nigga must be lucky lucky
She's such a doll, I guess that makes me Chucky
Wassup with ya'll other than nothing at all?
Bitches lickin' my balls, you ain't nuttin' at all!
You ain't nuttin' at all
Neither am I
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!

I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O

[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga

[Verse 2:]
Life's a bitch, but she won't let me hit
So I just masturbate to her naked flicks
I ain't got change for a dolla, but I think I'm making sense
I do resemble my father, but do I really know I'm his?
Sometimes I like to go on a tangent of random shit
Stay with her Black n Mild out with a handful of acid tips
Skywalker in the blunt, Darth Vader in the cup
You don't get lifted with us, your elevators stuck
I never gave a fuck, my name never came up
But now that I done came up, I think I'm King Tut
I told Punch I'd probably get assassinated by the government
He probably think I'm sniffin' cocaine and some other shit
I'm on some other shit, Black Hippie ho!
Yippy ka yeee, Yippy ka yoo
Tilt ya head you see me in the sky
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!

I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O

[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga

[Verse 3:]
Drownin' in Moscato, popular pothead
Feel like I hit the lotto, and I just got head
From a famous model (who?), Gloria Velez
Lusting for Cubana's culo you know what it is
I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, experience my fate
All I'm missin' is a band of gypsies and some purple haze
But now it's OG Kush and aeroinstrumentals
No need to insinuate, miss me with the innuendo
Ya outlooks lousy someone needs a new window
I'm a win I just don't know when though you bimbos know what you in for some info to make you exercise your mental
A seed small as my pinkie can be your weeping willow
I'm so I'll I'm held hostage at a hospital
Doin' it big like not little
Tivo the revolution when it's televised
Heaven's a better place, I hope you all die!

I think I'm Jimi Hendrix, I think I'm Kurt Cobain
I think I'm John Lennon, gone insane
Someone take this gun, before I blow out my brains (BANG)
Ab-Soul, and A-Y-I-R-O

[Chorus:]
Grab a bitch then grab ya dick
Pop a fifth and have a sip
Smoke a blunt, pop a pill
Fly nigga, fly nigga
Party every single night
Mingle with a nigga wife
Doggone, we all gone
Die nigga, die nigga

[Intro:]
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, Gimme mine
Uh, gimme mine, uh, gimme mine
Gimme mine, bitch gimme mine
Gimme mine, nigga gimme mine
Gimme mine, gimme mine

But I...

[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining

Let me get it back from the top Ali

[Verse 1:]
Life
I wonder will it take me underground like a runaway slave
Where the hip hop radio don't play, what more can I say
I need to get away from the lights...
Flashing in my face like a topless model
And the topless bottles keep popping like a Glock
And it's coming non-stop, take a shot - don't worry about the price
Everything is paid for, you fully accommodated
When you bumping shoulders with the Grammy nominated
Making American Pie, get you a slice
It's the American Dream, right?
So it seems I need to air out my self-esteem
It's so high

But I...

[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh

[Verse 2:]
Almost lost my life to the industry
Better yet I did, I should bury me
And I ain't even sell one record yet
And she can see I'm hanging on barely
And my bitch say I'm arrogant
Cause when she with me I feel she should cherish it
Only cause you never know when I'm a perish
Not the clothing line but if the shit fit I wear it
Stick to the script I will - Ferris
Nobody ever said it'll be fair so
When the tabloids read "Death To Ab-Soul"
I couldn't get up, said I'll keep it on the down low
You never know what's next, or know what to expect
Still wanted for [?], but now I'm a prospect
From dusk until dawn, I feel like a object
Under a telescope

But I...

[Hook:]
Wish I could put the B.S. behind me
And yes, I've been fresh, you need sterilizing
And yes, I've been left, and you ain't invited
Every time I'm arriving everybody excited
Just witness the glitz and the glam of shining
Can't tell who real or who lying
(I may just) need to
(Go on a hiatus) Yeahhh

[Bridge:]
I loosen my tie
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)

[Intro plays until end of song]
I need a Mai Tai
So I can drown in my drink
I loosen my tie
And give myself some space to breathe
I see the skyline
And the clouds are so at peace
I need some my time (my time my time)


You know it feel like that though

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yes you were designed to fail
No you will never attain, everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Don't take responsibility for your actions anyway
In anyway, shape form of fashion
Don't be rational for goodness sake, a-dapt
There's no need to stand up, act like you got bad back
Spasms that you can't take
You are not invincible, imbecile you can break
I pity you, pitiful and I hope you go to hell
Even if the pit is full
Let's make that a mandate
I hope you hate what I did to you, did I get to you?

[Hook: Alori joh]
Everybody, wants to, be victorious
We can make this (world) more of a euphoria

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Yes you were designed to fail
No you will never attain, everything
Look at your primitive brain
Look at your ignorant ways
Look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look away
Think of all the bad decisions you made
In the past even to this day
Drive yourself mad, run out of gas on the information interstate
That might be a bit much if it is in my intents to offend ya
And leave dents in your confidence
Blow your fuse, sabotage your views
So you can keep a funky attitude, like the parliament
And everyday I do, that's why you never grew

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
No you weren't designed to fail
Yes you where meant to attain, everything
What a magnificent brain
Such benevolent ways, look at your innocent eyes
When the mirror look your way, look her straight
In the face, come to grips with who you are and
Who you ain't
Where you going, where you been
Help your family, help your friends
Plant a seed, teach, he or she to be the, deity
The media will never perceive us
As, get your five dolla' ass up
Make change, make a way for today
Tomorrow was yesterday
Find a fine line between time and space
Contact the cosmos and you'll hear em say

[Hook]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
The vail is being raised
For many, we are living in the last days
For us, it's only the beginning
One love, one conscious, one kinetic mind
Hiii Power!


(You got, you got some more moscato?)

[Ab Soul:]
Yeah
She's a mean girl
I'm a nice guy
We all know opposite attract
Like a rail road
And I like
You to do anything you please
When you're with me
Mama
Let's head home
And crack a bottle of the Sutter's Home
And hit some trees, Why not?
Where your head at
Hope it's in the gutter like mine
Not where you find rats
Talkin' about where you find ecstasy
Come have a lil bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the mornin'
Till the sun has fallin'
Like a new born
Baby you stallin'
You know you want all this
Long dick
Oh shit
Might want to make you my misses
Like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room
Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (What?)
Peek-at-chu
Let's pop this cork
Let me rub on your neck
Till your Victoria's secret get all wet
And your Victoria's secret safe with me
Let me Victoria's secret leave your legs

[Bridge:]
I know you had a hard day baby
Relax your mind
Shit
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
Everything was fine

[Hook:]
When things get hard to swallow
We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
Ya love it
We can even do it tomorrow
Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo (mm hum yeah, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the moment for your lovin' (But now we on somthin' new)
You love it

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Uh
Guess whose back in this mother fucker
Lookin' like a mother fuckin' chi-town pimp
Alright
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
Make my money flip
I'll be in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
With an AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk
Make everybody scream
Put the missing punk
On everybody's screen
Ain't nothin' changed bout the ends I'm holdin'
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed
But a nigga be rollin' with a bad bitch
And the bitch be rollin'
Dolphin pills and moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessey on the bartender bill
Just a good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight
And fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight
Plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite
With a 5-Star freak
Slingin' that dick while baby eat
On her punani
Ooo mommys
Look at yours bodies
I'm geeked
Havin' a good time
Put my
Peen
In a muther fuckin
Bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga don't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)

[Bridge:]
I know you had a hard day baby
Relax your mind
Shit
Soon as Christ turned water into wine
Everything was fine

[Hook]
When things get hard to swallow
We need a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
Ya love it
We can even do it tomorrow
Just bring a bottle of moscatoooooooo
Puts me in the moment for your lovin'
You love it

[Ab Soul:]
Uh
I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up

I said
It's a celebration
Clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp
With a glass of moscato
What up ho, what up
I said
What up ho, what up
Alright

Sip slow
Relaxation
That's are motto
Soul


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Hello, good morning
This is mourning, just a feeling I reckon
I cut on the beat and if I feel it I wreck it
I heard I got fans and friends playing my records
I'll visit as soon as I can, you can bet it
Don't forget that dash in my name when you print it
It'll make me feel bleak like Jay's apprentice
Niggas looking real meek soon as we step in it
I'm a God MC not a polytheist
And why is your reaction always so obvious
Let a reverend run in my adidas
You'll see that despite all these dislikes I am like Jesus
Don't follow 10 commandments
But I don't seem to break to many of them either
Try to understand me
Obama said "yes we can"
But that can't be
Cause we was raising money for his campaign
T-shirt, plates, and mugs
But won't do the same in our own community?
What the fuck...
I said what the fuck?

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
How's it going, good afternoon
I'm doing swell I hope I can say the same for you
It's funny though, I could have just told a lie
And made it true to take the mood
You think I am what I ain't
Like a saint or fake
We could go toe to toe, you're choice it's no debate
Soul brother number 2
And every single one of my dreams is coming true
I try to smoke weed to give me the fix I need
But it always ends up with me running out of tree
In sheer disbelief
Tell me how I can get high as the sky and keep my ear to the streets
At the same time, no diamonds in my watch
Can I still shine, will anybody watch
If I could hold you attention for at least a minute
You'll gain so much wisdom you'll need to see a dentist
Grow up in my society see why I'm a menace
And obviously ominous to your opinions
Call myself the King of Carson like I hold dominion
Hoping nobody notices that I had no permission
I don't mean to disrespect when I express
My vision was meant to connect not to reject
Don't press eject...
I said don't press eject...
Soul!

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
And it ain't nothing new
All I do is eat, sleep, and shit
Reflect on my life
Find the perfect words to rhyme it with
Ain't concerned with what ain't been confirmed
And I got the right, think I've reached the point of no return

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
It ain't nothing new to me
Should be nothing new to you
Let's accomplish the impossible
Free in body, mind, and soul

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
No idea's original
It's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do
But how it's done
If you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means your inferior not major...


[Intro]
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star

Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star

Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
If you ain't got a dollar to your name
Can you maintain?
Are you lost, are all your thoughts
On the same train?
I been ridin it, doubt
Despite the amount
I've yet to acquire
In my checking account
They checkin me out
They peepin my game
I paid my dues
I even kept my receipt and my change
My life is like a movie
If Siskel hate it then sue me
Fuck a Maybach, I'm straight in the back of this hooptie
It started out a hobby, became my life
Left my emotions, lonesome, hence the pain I write
Some call it therapy
Some call it rap music
I call it hip-hop
No, no
No trap music
You never seen me heat the pot
To whip the rock
You never seen me creepin down your block
With the Glock
You never seen no diamonds in my chain
Or in my watch
You never seen me in a G5
Or on a yacht
But picture that

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Speaking of being at the top (Champagne, bottoms up)
I take that back, cause matter of fact
This E and J
Dollar shot
Is hittin the spot
Like a rave
My real niggas give me props
Cause I ain't afraid to say
What I am and what I am not
You had her not
I had like seven dollars knowin I'mma drop five
On that session
As soon as A-chizzle hit the block
Chocolate swisher burn slow
Though I hope it never stop
So I can get high
And accomplish my endeavors
Niggas pullin up in benzes, tellin me that I'm the one
I'm guessin when my clock climaxes then my time'll come
I never shot a gun
But I be killin all y'all raps
Cause all y'all wack
I be joggin on all y'all tracks
I mean so many lines that
I could call you all back, yeah
I could send you all a fax, with all facts
Budget tighter than my bitch's all black bra strap
Grab a digital camera
And
Picture that

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be

[Interlude]
Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star

Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be almost a star

Shoot for the moon
Even if you miss
You'll be

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
In the presence of my gifted ass
Incredible gift of gab
Don't have a cent to spare
But pull up a chair, I'll take you back
To where my Christmases was full of gifts
I surely had
Left Santa milk and cookies
(We miss you Bernie Mac)
Left him a letter
And what do you know, he even wrote my back
I don't remember what it said
But the point is that
Soon as I had to take the role for my own acts
It seemed as though, all my presents started gradually turnin into coal
I graduated with a car
Four years later that motherfucker's stuck in park
I missed the days we cut through the alley to the limo park
Or further than that
Nick at Nite, Are you Afraid of the Dark?
I keep these memories on my mind
Cause they define me like Dictionary.com
Bliss kisses ignorance
Pay them unless
Your intelligent
And her pussy be wet as shit
You would come in a flash
Please hold the flash
But picture that

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Picture this
Picture being poor
Picture being rich
Picture having more
Picture not having shit
Picture that
What a sight to see
Picture you, picture me, picture us, picture we
Together at the top
Where we should be

[Javonte]
Photogenic I are
No need to be camera shy
Hand on the bible, I ain't tellin a lie
We only got one, so I'm livin my life

Photogenic I are
No need to be camera shy
Remember where I been, where I'm going
And I only got one, so I'm livin my life


[Verse 1:]
It's Mr Ab Soulutely
More drive than the fastest hooptie
More alive than a newborn unicorn in the sky
And I just get more fly by the second I wreck it
That immortality is not a myth or just a lie
'Cause every time I speak this thesis is justified
Sublime rhyme and reason being why
I am I sayonara if you can't keep up for the ride

[Hook:]
Just for my
Just for my
Just for my (open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
Real Thinkers (Open up)
And touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Real thinkers (open up)
Real thinkers (open up)
You thirsty?
Open Up Your Mind

[Bridge: x4]
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't

[Verse 2:]
Understand exactly what it takes to be creative
And display greatness the dedication it takes
The time consumption the stakes if you say it ain't high
That's a blind assumption and open your eyes or something
Defy the odds
Multiply with nothing grip the skies
I open minds in hopes that you open your mind
Holding my fro and scoping the scene out
And spitting sixteens spitting my spleen out
Thought I had it made but ain't shit clean
And I been chasing this dream since Wayne made Bling Bling
I drift off in thought and teleport to Beijing
Pushing 25 but still feelin like 18
With more insight than a encyclopedia
The Carson Arson warm enough to fight anemia
And I'm just warning up
Got em sweating bullets big enough to load the pump

[Hook:]
Just for my
Just for my
Just for my (open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
Real Thinkers (Open up)
Real Thinkers (Open Up)
You can touch the sky
Touch the sky
Touch the sky
Real thinkers (open up)
Real thinkers (open up)
Open Up Your Mind

[Bridge: x4]
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't think
Niggas don't

[Verse 3:]
Strategize, just fantasize
They don't emulate they just antagonize
They don't illustrate they just be writing rhymes
They don't demonstrate they hide behind their lines
And on my rise to success
I'm just searching for the perfect concept
I swear I'll be the Einstein of my time
It's not E but AB equals MC squared

LONG TERM MENTALITY


[Intro]
Fucking wisdom tooth hurt
Awww maaaan [laughs]
[Female Voice] "Time flies when you're having fun"

[Verse 1]
I can't even let it breath
I ain't got a second to spare
But I'm definitely hair, like fur
Do you concur?
I'm only the seed of Herbert the Third
And the creature conceived in Korea
Word
More of a reason to be a overseer
Four years older than Helina, man we're getting old
In four years your be a senior, at least I hope
And hope is all a nigga got
You put your all in something, then that's all you've got
So why would that lollygag
Popping four fives, pop a tag
There's more to life
I know my wrongs, I know my rights
And while you jog, I travel at the speed of light
I see the light, shades on
You got an Audemars with diamonds in the face, huh

[Hook]
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Question, how many milliseconds in a year?
31,558,468,000 and yeah, I googled it
But which one of you would have counted?
I thought it was astounding
My biggest fear is blinking and missing a whole year and thinking I was tripping
Now that's a disappearing act for your ass
Wesley and Sanaa didn't have it that bad
My mind travel so fast that I can see the future today
Trying to escape like a fugitive in 2088, play it safe
Preparate, you still trying to segregate
You better be trying to get your ticket on them arks they about to make
Know or be amazed, you caught in a maze
You need your hair done, you need the brand new Js
You need your nails done and you need 28s
So you can skate on them hoes, fuck if they say no, there's plenty more

[Hook]
Cause time is of the essence
You ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Yeah Ima run the world til my clock stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
Praying destiny is manifested

[Female Voice] "Time Flies when your having fun"

Time [x3]

[Verse 3: Punch]
Chronomentrophobia, the fear of time
I'm Francis Ford Coppola
The writer of Apocalypse Now is upon us
I guess time is the opponent
With Armageddon approaching, I'm striving to be the dopest
Instead of getting prepared, I'm focused on hypnosis
With the flow, yeah I know how close it is
I'd rather match with Soul about who the coldest is
And carry on like I don't notice this
Sprinkle jewels here and there while committing the grossest sins
Infinite living just isn't consistent with our comprehension
Everything we know has an ending
Analyze time, it means limits, I never knew them
I'm throwing shots back, the world spinning
4026 before our common era man was made
In 2012 we live in terror
Cause time is of the essence
We ain't got time for no comments or no suggestions
But just begging my pardon, enjoying my party
Cause Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Yeah, said Ima keep spinning until the world stop homey
Cause time is of the essence
I hope my intellect is manifested

There's so much more I want to say but there's just not enough time

Time [x4]


You would have thought I was infatuated with being underrated instead of renowned
Got me feeling like King David before the crown
I too have my views like you
Look what I do to stand on stages in front of crowds
I need food but I'd rather smoke a Black & Mild
Get back in the booth and spill my heart until I bust a valve
And that's the truth, hand over my left titty
I had faith in hip hop before she met Biggie
Just take this shit a day at a time
I thought I was on after Day In The Life
But you know our shit get put on hold after reality strikes
You ain't know [?]
How you eat when there ain't even a bowl?
My stomach sound like something in the jungle
My mind saying give it up, the people saying don't go
It's easier to leave when you ain't got no dough
Cheap champagne wishes and thirty ratchet hoes
All up in my videos until you niggas see the vision (I ain't playing)
Guess a nigga never checked out the tension
In my second childhood making music from the soul
Just so you know, cracker back [?]

On and on and on and

They think me and these other rappers have something in common
God bless them, all men
I ain't stressing, I'm all in
They in Lois Lane, I'm Clark Kent
Go back to what's happening
Jay Rock finna drop and walk you all around [?]
Kendrick keep getting chased by cameramen
And for the first time you've seen a Hoover Crip on the charts
As for me I'm still an amateur, venting
Looking for the right cannon
To capture your attention, I need honorable mention
Most of all I need to exist in the fourth dimension
But niggas say I sing better than I rap
Who give a crap about all them damn metaphors and diction? (fuck that)
Took a step back to reevaluate my steez
Went to friendzone alone and wrote a gang of trees
Labels calling for everybody except for me
Like I ain't got the recipe
Like this ain't my destiny
You know how much my family expect from me?
Especially considering I'm literally chasing a dream
Told G-packs I'm a slip through the crack
Get that cream, that's a fact yo
Whoever thought I'd get to write for Dr. Dre?
He probably thought it was trash and threw that shit away
But it's a new day, new possibilities
My time'll come sooner enough
No hostility, that type of shit'll slow you up
Don't get caught up in all of the marketing to show you up
He from Top Dawg?, he more like a pup
He ain't from the streets, where the fuck he come from?
Who cosigning [?], don't believe the hype
You niggas can't see me, can't call me on Skype
I'm all bite, no bark
A Benz to a Go-kart
All I do is go as hard as adult film costars
So on and so on
Never lag, never that
You can't see?, look
They told me to break a leg, so now I'm an amputee
Give me fifty feet like G-unit's sneaks
Soul brother number two times whoever you bring
Motherfucker
T.D.U.D


Everybody get the fuck down now
Soul in the building
Yeah, we taking everything
Everything you got

Hit the deck I need everything you possess
I suggest you cooperate for this tech
Send you to the doctor to operate
You complicate my scheme to get rich
I'll put this heat to your T, let it steam a little bit
Look, when the chips get low, my fifth just blow
Anything that I could pawn, come about that, dog
It's money to be made and if you got it I'm taking it
Just run it like a Jamaican and shut the fuck up, nigga

[Hook:]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash

Coming for you
Don't let me catch you slipping in that pretty whip you dip in
You would get pulled out
Like my dick in these women when I'm finna bust, don't test my clout
Your execution is a must, no doubt
For the longest niggas been taking my kindness for weakness
But this trigger is killing me and I'm just dying to squeeze it
Fire for hire, don't let your murder transpire
Thinking you will live forever like a fucking vampire
I arose from the dark to claim everything you own
And there's nothing between us but opportunity and this chrome
It don't take a genius to know I mean this, so ante up
Before I load the cannon up and blow your ass to Canada
Nigga

[Hook:]
And that might leave more than a rash
I'm coming for your ass
Please hand me the cash
Cause when I'm down on my last
I gotta re-up fast
Point me to your stash
Don't make me say it again
Before I lay you with Reagan, Benjamin Franklin, and them
Frankly I'm a menace
In fact I'm ready to blast
So whatever you got, run it
Like a 100 yard dash

I'm wild with it, pistol whip whoever's in the house with it
Call the cops, tell 'em like a date, I'm going out with it
Give me the goods, give me the hand me downs
Tell your wife to pull her panties down
I need those too, what you gon' do?
Don't jeopardize your life, for the nigga hard body made of cement
Plus I'm loaded like this clip, off of the Seagrams
Lay you on the floor like granite
Granted your granny watching, I'm grinning like I ain't just hit 'em
Better believe it, my head's sort of off, shit
I would have robbed Jesus for the cross if I caught him slipping
God forgive him for this long arm like Pippen
The cars honk but times is hard hard and I gotta eat
Give me the watch, the Sean-John, even your sneaks
Give me your socks, your drawers, your fitted, your Boost minutes
Give me your stocks, your bonds, your blunts, your bongs
Your food in the fridge, your iPod, your celly
You say I'm wrong but I'm deadly
That's dead wrong so I'm heavy
Like Chris Wallace, regardless
You're getting stuck up, pussy
Like a tampon with a handgun, push me
But I ain't on the swings, I got this infrared beam and it wouldn't miss a thing
Bow!

Chyea! Rose
I got you nigga
I want everything
I want the jewels, the watches, the bling bling, all that shit
All y'all little niggas getting your chains robbed
I'm on you
I'm just playing y'all, I wouldn't hurt a fly
Came out dope though
Carson arsonist
Yeah, it's funny that you say Carson-Carson arsonist
That's where you're from right? Carson?
Yes, yes sir
Where is that exactly? If I looked on a map, where would I be lookin'?
Carson is right in between Compton and Long Beach
Shout out to Carson, Del Amo, that's where I'm from though, DA


Guess it's got to the point
Where I just gotta spell this shit out for y'all, know what I mean?
See, y'all niggas hear the name Ab-Soul, right?
Y'all niggas think I'm supposed to be talkin' about mu fuckin'
The flowers and the earth or somethin' like that, know what I'm talkin' about?
I'm a real ass nigga though, on everything
Lemme break it down

[Hook:]
I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like the blood of fallen soldiers above

You put it all together and you get Ab-Soul-
Lutely, the best, salute me or meet death
Like Gaylord Focker met the parents of his girl Martha
We're staring at you, will depart ya
Thats the 38 special
Commentary from the King author not the knights of the round table sponsor
But amongst the dopest the west coast has had to offer since the '80s crack epidemic
I play drums for the contraband
Matter of fact, hit me
King Blue you a fool for this one
I ain't even gon' spit, just drool on this one
My saliva's way liver than yours, rappers
Shut your trap 'fore I set it
Y'all gassed up like your guns, unleaded
Yeah I said it, don't chat, no telling where we headed
Close shop when I open fire
Cause Soul known to carry the cannon like Mariah
Yes I uh
Bring it to you raw and uncut
No buts like an empty ash tray, what the fuck

Matter of fact, lemme break it down for y'all one more time, look

[Hook:]
I said A is for the apple on the tree I ain't far from
B is for the bottom of the bottle of hard rum
Dash to the finish line, chasing the S
Which stands for my favorite three letter word (Sex)
O is for all the ounces of dro I consume
U meaning a unanimous decision of whom
Is number 1, leaving the L which stands for Love
I spread it like a virus, it'll kill you if you buy it

I'm with your girl playing games like
Who could get the highest at the Hyatt, real fun you should try it
I got her wet, I'll send her back to you to dry it
You ain't the flyest or the king of the jungle, but you lying
And I can see it through ya iris
Drink like I'm Irish, think like a genius
Fall back I'm all that like Kel and Keenan
Add a bag of chips and the baddest bitch
I'll be posing with a black in my mouth, grabbing my dick
Constipation is an understatement I ain't ever gave a shit
You know you hot when
You only get 8 bars in a song and it's still everybody's favorite
My fault, my god, I'm a problem like a broke condom
A editor just told me nobody was in my column
Top Dawg 4th wheel and I'm still ill
Open up the car door that look like a steel mill
I hotbox like cable in the hood
And I'm good like wrenches with a sentence, understood?
And if it's not I'll leave you with this
Top Notch muthafucka, like snot muthafucka, I'm sick

Don't get infected
Bitch ass niggas
T-D-E


[Ab-Soul:]
Hey, welcome to DA nigga
I really thought I was a drummer for a second there

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Follow me home, see where I was rose
Like the one in 2Pac's song that grew from the concrete
Half a line in Del Amo on cross streets
Baby baby mommas strappin' babies in carseats
Niggas failed art class, still they'll draw heat
Design a murder scene faster than an architect with a masters
One out of three niggas you know slang, that's a accurate fraction
Sunday dinner denim for packin' a mac in
Cheese in the pockets of potential rocket scientists gone bad
Like good girls movin' too rapid
Had it not been for the social status we after, our
Minds could've been on more than after hours
Some of us become legends, some are labeled as cowards
Others fall in between, I say I'm a king
Now you can disagree or kiss the ring
Either way nigga's kneel to my feet, don't be late
And if you make it in time to hear the trumpets, I
Know you gon' love it cause I love it
What's that?

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Who wanna go 15 in a Del Amo park alley
Used to battle with the pep rally
Rest in peace Prospect, I miss you like a missile
I can vision you blowing up
I launch it in your memory soldier
Ask capital Z about snap capital G
How we used to wear triple A's and Footlocker T's
Two toned fitteds from Swap Meet
Prepaid Nokias would light up antennas at the AMC movie theater
Back when the bitches wouldn't holler
I was short 75 cent, he threw me a dollar
Can't forget J Silk, my ace boon coon
On me JT would've been proud of you
We used to mob to McDonalds every day after school
Or Shakey's for pizza if our allowance would allow it
I was wildin' saggin' with the crips I had no business
I learned, job or no job your ass better be with the business
I became an alchemist over instrumentals
I'm Jim Dear over here, that's the mayor say your prayers
It's C-A-R-son, daughter, father, mother's own
Turn my shakin' haters off and I'm right at home
And if you at home with me and hear the trumpets
I know you gon' love it, cause I love it
What's that?

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
My city blowin' them horns, it sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like
It sounds like

[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]
How you like your stay so far?
Is it all it's cracked up to be?

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
If you ever caught the Carson Circuit
Ditchin' fifth period to hit the mall, then I hope you hearin' this
I do this for y'all, cause y'all can relate to me, you're my family
If you went to Cheapwood, Frog Acres, or Bannana Lee
And still hit the ARCO on Del Amo in central for gasoline
Chances are we know each other well
Not the one for wishes or for fishes, more like good
If you touched ever Carson corner I once stood, then would you
Just open your ears and hear the trumpets, I know you gon' love it
Cause I love it

[Ab-Soul:]
Sound so beautiful, don't you agree?
Really feel like, really feel like I'm the king of Carson right now man
For real, nothing y'all niggas could tell me


[Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar):]
My nigga, do you have a gas can?
(The fuck I'm gonna do with a gas can, nah, nigga what?)
It's just been a long ass day, man
All I need is a gas can
(Na, try down across the street, I think that nigga keep one, I don't know)
I'm finna head over there and I'mma be right back
(Fuck what you doing, man?
Knocking on the door extra hard and shit like you just stressed out or something)
My nigga, I don't even know where to begin, dog
(What happened, man?)

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Look, I woke up this morning feeling fucked up
What else is new? Like God be like, "To hell with you"
To tell the truth, I ain't been to church in like three or fo'
Years, not months, have mercy on my soul
Threw on the wife-beater, put a fitted on my skull
Took a long ass piss, grabbed my shades and hit the door
I had half a blunt left from last night
I lit that bitch up like a lightbulb and got right
Started to orchestrate my day like a maestro
I should hit the lab, I got verses like the Bible
I heard hip hop need revival
It's been camouflaged like the mascot for Geico
In that bullshit, I took another pull quick
My mind flooded like a fucking swimming pool is
Went back in the house, raided my mom's refrigerator
But everybody's on a diet and my stomach ain't quiet
I said, "Fuck it", hit the shower like a jackpot
The weed got my teeth off-white like crack rock
Toothbrush from the 99 cent store
I got a million dollar smile, it don't make sense though
Threw on my army fatigue shorts and a T that say "Peace Not War"
Now everybody eyeing me
I don't know if I need an iron or it's the irony
And by the way, I'm at the gas station now
But not to get gas, just another black and mild
Shit this half a half a tank gon' have to last until Monday
And it's Tuesday, the bitches still want me like a bouquet
I hit my nigga Agent, he want to roll up two Ls like Cool J
I'm like, "Alright, cool, Jay"
But I gotta be at work by 3, it's midday
I can't go in smelling like weed, he said, "Okay"
Stop by the cheap tobacco store, two swishers for a dollar
And when he meet me, we finna get high, like a greeting
He told me, "Drop five", I said, "I got you next time"
Long story short, I bumped my head on cloud nine
And I'm chilly chill even when it's hot outside
Rode to the studio rather blasted
I spit like a dragon that'll leave a fan flabbergasted
That's when my gas and my check engine light
Clicked on at the same exact time I signal right
And that ain't right, I got shit to do today
Cause any day you could be attending my eulogy
Got to the studio when everybody left
I saw a note that read, "We went to go work on Detox with Weezy F"

[Break - Kendrick Lamar & (Ab-Soul):]
My fault nigga, I actually came up with the idea to write that
(You laughin' but that shit ain't funny man)
It was funny at first but

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew
Tell 'em the regular nigga said it and that it
A day in the life
Of mister soul brother number deuce
Damn he nice
I'm thinking if you only knew
You could fuck with it or middle fingers up to your whole crew

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar):]
Now it's 2:58 and I'm running late for work
Running meanin' stuck in traffic cause the Home Depot is finna jerk
I been in the same position before
Manager said it better be my last time, but it won't
I clocked in around 3:10 and I'm wishing I didn't
Cause UPS just brought in this big ass shipment
And for those that don't know, I work at a record store
And I make hot records (That's a sick ass gimmick)
Finished the inventory then I logged on Myspace
I had one download and 'bout 16 plays
5 friend requests from sucka MCs making a name
I signed out and had to question my aim (You weak nigga, that's all)
This old-timer walked in and we got to talking about Eric B and Rakim
And the perm on Al Sharpton
Osama bin Laden, Obama in the office
And he looked me in my face and said I'm destined for fame
Told him I do music, he like, "Whatever you do, do it
And don't blink, the moment you close your eyes, you'll lose it"
Word to wise, that was some great advice
That I took like I stole it, then my head sort of swollen
I guess that's why I shits on 'em like a cleansed colon
Told the rest of the shoppers we finna be closing
I locked up like Akon and hit the street
It's 8 PM, and I ain't had shit to eat
All day, KFC, snackers a dollar each
Bar-b-que and nacho cheese
I bought 4, ate 3, gave one to Top Dawg
I would've had one for Punch but he moved like a sloth
I'm back at the studio now if I lost ya
And everything's straight, you can thank great posture
Hit my lil momma up cause I'm trying to cut
But she on the rag and I don't mean a bandanna
She told me come through, she gave me head like Rihanna
And I deserve a standing ovation for my swagger
Chuck the deuce, headed for the car to finish off the night right
But it wouldn't start

[Ab-Soul & (Kendrick Lamar):]
Laugh it up nigga, laugh it up man
Shit ain't funny man, that's why I need that damn gas can
(Gas, nigga, you gotta put 5 dollars not 3 in)
Shit nigga I ain't got 5 dollars to put in!
(That'll get you one gallon, nigga)
Whatever man, bullshit dog, keep laughin'
(Tryin' to save that extra dollar for that menu
For the McDonalds menu nigga ain't gotta cut all the time
Nigga you gotta put the whole 5 in it)
You gon' shoot me 5 or what? Fuckin' bastard
(I know you're on a budget, but damn)


[Ab-Soul:]
Rude boy Ab-Soul
Top Dawg rottweiler
Just fall in this motherfucker like

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Just tell me when, I'm ready baby
I been ready baby, since 1987 sometime late February
I'm a boss I need an office and a secretary
Numero uno, you know, never secondary
And I'mma stunt even if a nigga never dare me
They say I'm legendary, but I ain't done much
Never heard of a knife, right, I'm uncut
That's raw footage, don't get it fucked up
And you ain't shot shit, that was Duck Hunt
I scare 'em, you saw me and thought you saw three
Cause I could put your life on pause like dogs feet
And you don't wanna Top Notch dot com-pete
Cause like this track, I got y'all beat
By like a hundred fuckin' points
I'mma have to celebrate and smoke a hundred fuckin' joints, light up
I feel like smokin' a nigga
Summer day supersoakin' a nigga, yeah him and both of his niggas
Can get it fresh out of the clip and a surgeon could stitch him up
Affirmative, permanent rest, but

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Say
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
No

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I get this funny feelin' around wannabe killers
Who supposed to move in silence, but be loud as sirens
And when it go down, they known to back down like, "Stop the violence"
And will probably cry if ever locked in a cage like Biron
I'm crucifying liars like Pontius Pilate
Whoever try'll vanish
I'm on a wack rapper diet and I'm famished
Hi, I'm so high I could kick the planet
Watch your world shift and then fix the damage
I talk bread like every second, I been a sandwich
And you're in the wrong profession, you're like a deaf pianist
And you could use a pill like fresh bananas
I do this in my sleep, smooth like silk pajamas
But you don't wanna Top Notch dot com-pete
Cause like this track, I got y'all beat
By like a hundred fuckin' points
I'mma have to celebrate and smoke a hundred fuckin' joints, light up
I feel like smokin' a nigga
Summer day supersoakin' a nigga, yeah him and both of his niggas
Can get it fresh out of the clip and a surgeon could stitch him up
Affirmative, permanent rest, but

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Say
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
No

[Verse 3 - Jay Rock:]
I swear it's days I feel like bustin' my gun
Niggas be pushin' me thinkin' I'm pussy
Until I clap, leave him on his back, from the mac
Empty the clip leave him stiff as a spliff, y'all don't hear me though
38s we don't play with those
AR hit your arm, have your homies like, "Where'd it go?"
I hate them fake rappers, better calm it down
Come to my town, I'mma show you how this llama sound
[?] holdin' my waste, Gucci belt buckle
Big ass [?] in my pocket, a couple of gs
In the club with Soul, yeah we puffin' the weed
Makin' it rain, money's nothin' to me
But niggas envy us, come and test us
Hot bullets hit your chest, fuck your flesh up
Duck, I don't wanna leave a body on my gat
Fuck around and leave a fuckin' dead body on the track
Damn, you don't wanna Top Dawg dot com-pete
I put a cease and desist on your heartbeat
Why? Because I'm motherfuckin' nuts
Me and Soul go celebrate and smoke a hundred fuckin' blunts
I feel like smokin' a nigga
Summer day supersoakin' a nigga, yeah him and both of his niggas
Can get it fresh out of the clip and a surgeon could stitch him up
Affirmative, permanent rest, what

[Hook x2 - Ab-Soul:]
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Say
Me no want nobody body on my guns
Me no want nobody body on my guns
No


[Ab-Soul:]
Yeah, got my nigga G Malone here, see he a g too
He understand what it be like
See I just wanna throw my swag on really
But Top and Punch, they just wanna see a nigga laid back
You know what I mean? Laid back

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
You imaginary niggas perplex me
You should see the corny shit they do to impress me
Actin' like bitches backstage who wanna sex me
Or baseball gloves all day tryin' to catch me
I run it like a track meet, but you never met me
Attract heat like black clothes or crack co-caine
My brain on the grain like a veggie (I'm uncomfortable dog)
You irritatin' like a wedgie
In particular I'm a don, mega like the maker of Friday
With nothin' to do and no job
This chrome that I hold will leave you holy like you know God
Sin City, murder in abundance
Where mothers look like they always smell onions
Ride by the elementary and kids cussin'
And it's nothin' new to us you could do to us
So get your weapon or player just get to steppin' up the stairway to heaven

[Hook:]
I'm a g from the floor
All the way up to the LA fitted up on my dome
They won't leave me alone (And I know)
You can't resist (And you don't)
Even exist
I see right through you niggas just like a ghost
Cause I'm a g for sure

[Verse 2 - Glasses Malone:]
They say I talk big shit
I can't help it, I'm on my sixth whip
[?] gotta say some slick shit
I'm so screwed up just like a [?]
Bobby B, I used to pitch sticks
Every pour I was forced just to take a few whiffs
That's why I'm part eclectic
High all the time and my art reflects it
[?] while we spark detectives
And money can't even get you marks accepted
You need to chill with the g talk
Cause half you rap bloods used to sea walk
Now all the fuckin' sudden you's a b dog
I been bangin' since hangin' by the seesaw
Niggas think bloodin' is a fad, on crip
Got my real blood homies lookin' bad

[Hook:]
I'm a g from the floor
All the way up to the LA fitted up on my dome
They won't leave me alone (And I know)
You can't resist (And you don't)
Even exist
I see right through you niggas just like a ghost
Cause I'm a g for sure

[Verse 3 - Schoolboy Q:]
Naw, I ain't into the tough talk
From the 1950's where we'd rather let our guns spark
Chill with your colored scarf, shots take your caps off
Close range with the burner, nigga, 'til your skull [?]
Get with shit, Top Dawg's one and only blue pit
All black four fifth dumpin' at your loose lips
Yeah I'm trippin', best believe a nigga crippin'
I'd even rob Obama if I catch the nigga slippin'
Catch a nigga dippin' nigga
Ridin' through the fifties on chucks lookin' crispy
Man I wish a nigga tempt me nigga
Bustin' 'til it's empty, done with the plan
Need to take a trip to hell and have the devil start prayin'
Hammer start sprayin', lead into my rifle
Make a nigga bleed just for fuckin' with my cycle
Bigger than the Eiffel
Tower, havin' power niggas softer than a flower
Time to make these cats devour

[Hook:]
I'm a g from the floor
All the way up to the LA fitted up on my dome
They won't leave me alone (And I know)
You can't resist (And you don't)
Even exist
I see right through you niggas just like a ghost
Cause I'm a g for sure

[Ab-Soul:]
Yeah homie, you already know how it's goin' homie
It's west coast homie, best coast homie, better smoke
Know what I'm sayin', left side of the map, know what I'm sayin'
Straight up, come to the hood, fuck with us
Know what I'm sayin', straight up
I be at the Del Amo Swap Meet right now
With the corduroy house slippers on with the back folded down under the
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, hey pass me a bigger rip


Long term is defined as:
To mature over or after a relatively long period of time
To earn capital gain derived from the sale or exchange of an asset held for a specified time
(This is Long Term)
Long term is defined as:
To earn capital gain
To mature over or after a relatively long period of time
Long term

I know it's short notice
But this is Long Term
Don't make the wrong turn
You're all trapped in my circle of doom
Be aware, success'll be circling through
I puff a square for my niggas who ain't here
To see me unbelievably make the unbelievable believe in me
Yeah, that's what I do times 2000 more than you
In 2000 I was cool
In '01 I had fun
In '02 I recorded my first song, and I was sprung
In '03 I was deep
In '04 I had flow
In '05 I signed to Street Beef for no dough
In '06 I met Punchline, damn I thank Punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchlines
'07 dude Dawg told me I was family
And now it's '08, Long Term, bon appetite

[Hook:]
This is Long Term
I hope you love it cause I'm thinking long term
I came, I saw, and conquered
And it's an honor
To share this with you, wait no longer
Mother fucker this is Long Term

Shout out to Top Notch, cause they gon' ride for me
That special pinhead who stay by my side, homie
Prospect holding a spot in the sky for me
That's on my life, real niggas never die, homie
Now all eyes on me, I see you niggas watching
Hoping that Soul sell out like a fucking auction
I'm in the laboratory working on a concoction
I ain't rapping, I'm a chemical reaction
To you niggas slackin'
Like suit bottoms, yo what's happening?
I'm back again, dope shop open like a cabinet
Chauffeurs could get arrested for trafficking me
Like I'm wrapped in vaseline and go for 18 5 a key
At 18 I was a G, sneaking in clubs
Breaking down dubs and the whole hood showed love
Never thought I would make it this far in this game
Now every bar is insane, but not the Long Beach game
And I don't need a big chain or Escalade on 6s
Cause I can roll with Juice and take all of your bitches
And you ain't never seen a top dog so vicious
I'm a star, right? Women hand me they wish-list
My reign is endless
You would need an umbrella that lasts forever to witness
My lyrical fitness
My physical's eminent
I know Caucasians that compare me to Eminem when he thought he was infinite
But this ain't 8 Mile and I ain't rapping
But ladies used to do me shady after math classes
Black lip bastard with black glasses
Bad habits backing up in the back of cab stratus ass magic
I'm Jay, more graphic, uncensored
So if your kids have it homie, it's promotional use only
And after this you owe me, like the letter after N my friend
I present Long Term, let's begin
This is Long Term


Hey, you ever feel life is like
Nothing's going good
You know what I mean?

I know it gets hard sometimes
Just know it's all in your mind
As long as your heart still beatin'
You've got a reason to smile

[Hook:]
Life is crazy
Never know what could happen 'til it happens
When it happens you'll be ready to face it
Time on Earth is precious, don't waste it
Life is crazy
One of your boys die, one of 'em have a baby
Today the sun shine, but tomorrow it's raining
And what could you do but see your way through
Keep your head up, baby, life is crazy

You could have all the money in the world, but be lonely as fuck
Nobody to trust, cause everybody out for your buck
Broke as a bitch, but the happiest camper
Why? Cause I'm still alive! Great answer
You could love Newports, but be dyin' of cancer
Have a broke leg, but be an inspiring dancer
Fight for your country and get shot in the head, dog
Or get caught in the Crip hood with red on
Win the lottery and lose your ticket
Buy a new Boost Mobile without no minutes
You could have a TV, but can't afford cable
Be the best emcee unsigned to a label
You could have a nice lamp with a blown lightbulb
Be married to a stripper at your local nightclub
Cause life is crazy and yes I could vouch
The truth hurts, can I get a, âOwwâ?

[Hook:]
Life is crazy
Never know what could happen 'til it happens
When it happens you'll be ready to face it
Time on Earth is precious, don't waste it
Life is crazy
One of your boys die, one of 'em have a baby
Today the sun shine, but tomorrow it's raining
And what could you do but see your way through
Keep your head up, baby, life is crazy

You could have a brand new Benz with no gas in it
Horny, but your girlfriend's practicin' abstinence
Win a silver medal and still be called a loser
Get framed for a murder and don't even know the shooter
Have Internet with no computer
Your daughter could be the victim of a sexual abuser
Your father could not really be your father, but a replacement
And you don't even know, he beat your ass like he made you
You could have a job and get laid off
Break both arms and watch people play golf
Paint a picture blind or spit a rhyme on mute
A chick say you're ugly, but your momma say you're cute
Somebody just scuffed your new Timbo's, shit
You could hear this song and think I'm talkin' 'bout you
Cause life is crazy and yes I could vouch
The truth hurts, can I get a, âOwwâ?

[Hook x2:]
Life is crazy
Never know what could happen 'til it happens
When it happens you'll be ready to face it
Time on Earth is precious, don't waste it
Life is crazy
One of your boys die, one of 'em have a baby
Today the sun shine, but tomorrow it's raining
And what could you do but see your way through
Keep your head up, baby, life is crazy


[Ab-Soul:]
Give me a little, little, little more volume on the vocals
Mic check, mic check one two
This is it right here Wave, this is it
Thank you for tuning in, hope y'all enjoyed yourself
Long Term

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Motherfucker this is Long Term, let me explain to you niggas
I'm here for the long haul
I'm fly as Curtis Pilot, you ever saw part of my Carson
Joggin' if y'all lost, but I been dedicated since back then
Started out with the double-time rhyme scheme I got from Twista
I couldn't quite convince the public, I was the one that'll put us up on the map
Throwin' away raps in a trash can
Fillin' my notebook up with my quotes, but the doors didn't open up
So I slowed it up
Found my niche, got my bars up
Black Planet freestyle chattin', get your guards up
Boys in Black had me hip to punchlines and all that
Came back with some hard stuff
What I was like, sixteen I think?
Killin' 'em, [?] box sealin' 'em, like the rooftop
Not quite a god emcee, more like Jay Reed, give me the oowop
I don't care who drop
Still found room for development
Before MySpace views were so relevant
Hey Soul, you ever think of sellin' it?
What? Your soul! Heavens no
Unless it cost that at Heaven's door
I pave my own way, no steppin' stones
My first break was playin' songs for Tory Crow
The judge looked out, we even shot a video
Shout-out my man June, can't forget my nigga Bones with the bangers
It's all love over here player
Before MP3 players could play us
I had a five-star tablet full of classics
At a time where every rapper was a gangsta or somethin'
Sort of became cliche some thought
From the suburbs where we do dirt and hope we never get caught
Hittin' a lie, why would I lie?

[Hook - Lori Writes:]
I've been watching you, to whomever this may concern
I can see your grind, what you got is well deserved
You gotta get up, get out, and get it, you can't always wait your turn
And it may not happen tomorrow, you gotta think long term

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I told myself like back in '05 I give this rap shit two years
But I'm still here
I've fallen in love with this hip-hop thing
Our relationship is real rare
The problem with a lot of newcomers is sad, but understood
I'm tryin' to make a great song, they tryin' to make it out the hood
I'm tryin' to be honored with the Pacs and Biggies
And they tryin' to see face on TV like, "Momma, see me?"
But it's a whole lot easier now
The Internet'll let the world play your media now
Your girlfriend cousin got a mixtape comin' out
And he got a beat you leased, but the producer is out of reach
This kid asked me how to make a name for himself
I told him I'm still tryin' to find a lane for myself
I could've lied to him and sold him a bunch of BS
But this is where the letter ends, before I go, P.S

What is long term?
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference
What is long term?
Long term is everlasting, long term is the thought of a future reference
Long term is everlasting


[Hook:]
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Speak the criminal slang
Lyrical homicide
Lyrically I'm worshipped, don't front the word sick
Sorry if I write like niggas with attitude
I'm the most anticipated
I'm what the west is missing

Sup y'all? I'm glad we could meet
I know it took a while for me to introduce my self properly
But this is me, I don't howl at the moon
I'm obviously a beast, I got fangs for teeth
Eatin' rappers like cabbage in your mamma's coleslaw
Soulbama, who you think your baby momma vote for?
I feel I'm the best that's done it so far
And that goes both ways, so far and so far
Half the kind of rhymes I write
Kind of remind me of like, lines in the Bible, I might
Be a disciple, but I ain't tryin' to spread no gospel
I wish y'all a great time under the sun
Life is short, live it like it ain't cause it might not be
21 years taught me that, nobody
Can take what I earn myself, 'til I earn myself
I was born to shine, like a firefly am I

[Hook:]
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Speak the criminal slang
Lyrical homicide
Lyrically I'm worshipped, don't front the word sick
Sorry if I write like niggas with attitude
I'm the most anticipated
I'm what the west is missing

And I'm in the best position to wreck rappers like tangles
From four angles, I see your plot unravel
I'm a lost angel, somebody got me for my halo
Around the time I wheelie'd my bike and watched cable
Exposed to the street and learned to roll to the beat
Had the gift since birth, but the curse was pre-natal
Ask my momma, she'll cosign I brought the drama
Kickin' her tummy like I punted for the Cowboys
Mat McBriar, the silent killer with loud noise
Tit for tat, I'm tic-tacin' Altoids
Fresh-dressed for the occasion to trample y'all cats
But you ignorant niggas ain't understandin' all that
Ask wizzle, I'm like a train in the clouds, I'm fly on the track
I'll take you there, but I ain't guidin' you back
The phase three metaphor reservoir dog off the leash
And y'all sleep, call the pound, I'm a clown and my

[Hook:]
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Speak the criminal slang
Lyrical homicide
Lyrically I'm worshipped, don't front the word sick
Sorry if I write like niggas with attitude
I'm the most anticipated
I'm what the west is missing


[Chorus:]
The Pain Is Gone!

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates but my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

[Ab-Soul:]
A minute ago, I was riding bicycles
And I can buy you Now & Laters with 5 nickels
When it was washing dishes and homework, cable and bullshit
I hit the block and never left
It was exciting watching life bring light to what I'm writing about like
A lamp in a cave, while I'm trapped in this maze
But Frankie Beverly wouldn't walk in my all-stars for a day
I watched kids play and think ignorance is bliss
Then I watched Kid-N-Play on House Party
And wished I was them
See you can say I'm brainwashed
Cause I came from an era where niggas don't care about nothing
And you're judged by how much your J's cost
But me being the rebel I am, I never gave a damn
Leave it to Beaver and the rest of you suckas
I'm complex like the magazine say I'm abstract
Like a trigonometry quiz and science lab rats
If I wasn't odd, you could see the pain in my eyes
I watched brothers kill brothers over system of legal tender
Deteriorating my loins with liquor looking for joy
I put my soul on a platter of joy
I do this for the regular people who out the ink route
Make it popular to be unpopular
Because if we all came together, ain't no stopping us
And it hurts me so, to think how they divided us
Like an island in the road
Just take control if you ain't know
And yo
Lock my body can't trap my mind
I got two decades of experience on my resume
Say I don't qualify and I'll call you a lie
I'm on a whole another plateau, you still tryna be fly
And that goes for the narrow minded who's ancestor was the pharaoh
He went from Number 1 to Zero
Let's Take it back

[Chorus:]
The Pain is gone!

[Punch:]
Nah she still on me
She stalking my innermost thoughts, I guess she want me
Because he primary fear is to die lonely
I got, no disdain for Ms. Pain
She leaves me love letters sealed with a kiss
Lipstick stains on the mirror
She helps me see things a little clearer
Couldn't experience joy if she wasn't near us
I remember throwing shots back til' I collapsed
Waking up hung over in the effort to give her the cold shoulder
It never worked
As soon as I sobered up, I couldn't avoid her tender touch
Like when Izakaya died
I couldn't look his mama in the eyes
Feeling like I contributed to his demise
Guilt stricken, heart victimized
Postpartum Syndrome, I'm blacking out
She's wishing it was me, she cried
Each tear was like a symphony orchestra
Beethoven over the organs, she snapping a tremendous proportion
Take this recording as the truth distorted
Through the eyes of a man who reaped the fruits of her courtship
And no fortune could ever overturn the misfortunes I absorbed in
The pain made me impure like foreskin, more that I can bargain
Fool, still I love her forever more

[Chorus:]
The Pain is Gone!

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Nah that bitch never leaves
Got me waking up in cold sweats, so I never sleep
Properly, I'm no Socrates, But my philosophy is
She gone follow me as long as I live

[Ab-Soul:]
And even when I die, she's going to follow my kids


What's poppin' nigga
Hey, hey, you goin' to that turnt-ass party or what?
Oh, absolutely!

I'm in the club with the squadron, mobbin'
VIP section, with VVS diamonds
Shinin' on a nigga like, âWhaaat?â
No jewelry I make a princess cut
Whenever I want I do whatever I want
I get whatever I want, I'm a spoiled bastard
Skinny nigga but a nigga's pockets fatter
Step my game up to the top of the ladder
Put another ladder on top of the ladder
Now I'm so high that the sky don't matter
I know no limits, I go the distance
Status quo ain't co-existing
Soul brother like no brother
No chastity belt that means there's no restrictions
I get up in it and get up out it
And get back in it, she screamin' and shoutin'
Like she caught the holy ghost, call me when she home alone
No I'm not Macaulay Culkin, but I'm pokin'
Hoes like I'm supposed to, give me a stamp
I'm finna go postal on this trip
If you feel the same way get your hands up like
12 o'clock, cause it'll never stop
Yeah and she glad she knew me
Can I get that baby? âAbsolutelyâ

[Hook:]
She never tell me no, she say, âAbsolutelyâ
How could she tell me no? I'm Mr. AB-SOULutely
I'm Mr. AB-SOULutely, meet Mr. AB-SOULutely
Yeah, yeah absolutely, yeah, yeah absolutely
âHey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutely
Hey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutely
Hey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutelyâ
Yeah, yeah absolutely, yeah, yeah absolutely

I'm in a Lambo now
Big chips like I'm finna gamble now
Paparazzi shootin' at me like ammo now
Never duck, never run, just pull a smile
Woo, woo, look at that nigga
He a multi-million dollar lookin' ass nigga
Hey and I'm sippin' my drank
She gon' give me that brain, nigga fuck what you think
I'mma tell you like a nigga told me
Chase that cream nigga chase that green
Don't chase them hoes, play your role
Keep 'em in line waitin' to get yours
Give 'em some work, give 'em some shows
Let they boyfriend pay for they nails and toes
Yeah, yeah, absolutely
Black glasses Gucci and the bag is Louis
Full of bags of ooey, I am a d-boy
All that shit right there for me, boy
Ab-Soul, the asshole
The gas-stove, I'm on fire man
I've been advertised, but I'm flyer man
I gotta necklace on, but I'm off the chain
Yeah and she glad she knew me
Can I get that baby? âAbsolutelyâ

[Hook:]
She never tell me no, she say, âAbsolutelyâ
How could she tell me no? I'm Mr. AB-SOULutely
I'm Mr. AB-SOULutely, meet Mr. AB-SOULutely
Yeah, yeah absolutely, yeah, yeah absolutely
âHey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutely
Hey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutely
Hey Mr. AB-SOULutely, hey Mr. AB-SOULutelyâ
Yeah, yeah absolutely, yeah, yeah absolutely

Lot of artists out here that's just out here
Just to say they rappers, you know what I'm sayin'
See us, shake our hands at the video shoots and all of that
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
I ain't gon' call on no names, but y'all know who y'all are
You know they can't really rap, but they
They always got mixtapes comin' out
You know what I'm sayin'? But like


I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Just a regular nigga doing regular shit
Yeah doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Only thing I ever seen with a purple label
Was a grape swisha, fill it with the purple kush
Pro fives all day, what you know 'bout that?
I know all my LA, niggas know 'bout that
I had the '87 with no system
Portable CD player adapter and it sound ok
Yeah it's a bucket, but I still make it around ok
I was a hustler making my rounds all day though
I keep the cool like a fridge in an igloo
Not too flashy and I ain't too ashy to class he, but that's me
Y'all niggas having menages, I was happy to score in the backseat
I had to get a job, y'all was pushing the packs
Y'all was on Melrose, we was on Am block
Y'all was shooting, we was going twenty-one no headshots
Enjoying it, you new rap niggas is spoiling it

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
I drive a regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressing the part in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
You niggas is living the dream
You niggas is getting the cream
Ab in the back, passin' a black
Which one of y'all don't know 'bout that?
I'm on my regular shit

[Verse 2 - Rapper Big Pooh:]
White shirt, black chucks
Some new tattoos, am I cool or what?
A few karats in the ear
And I make music that you need to hear
Cups up, let's toast to the year
Young old nigga, I ain't just appear
To the public, my picture's unclear
Around my neck, I don't sport chandeliers
And I don't travel in the Lear
Business or coach class, West coast I'm here
It's no benz's pulling up
No bitches in the back of the 'Bach trynna fuck
I just stack up my chips
Young black man traveling on the road to get rich
Then get wealthy, y'all don't smell me
Regular nigga now, ain't shit you can tell me

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
I drive a regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressing the part in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
You niggas is living the dream
You niggas is getting the cream
Ab in the back, passin' a black
Which one of y'all don't know 'bout that?
I'm on my regular shit

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
Okay, back to reality
You playboys makin' rap a fantasy
Hugh Hef could run hip-hop
How many of his hoes have y'all use his props?
In videos and whatnot, shows, entourage
How much your whole ensemble cost?
Look I'm sayin', there's nothing wrong with flossin'
But there's so much more important
Than what you sport in, how many mills you got
Or how many houses on the hill you got
They didn't love me when I was lucky enough to get new kicks
But now they all on some new shit, on who's dick?
Bargain shoppin', a walk-in closet
Until my money sky high like the mutant school
I like to give you what you're not immune to
You all look the same, I can't tell who's who

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
I'm just a regular nigga doing regular shit
I drive a regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressing the part in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
You niggas is living the dream
You niggas is getting the cream
Ab in the back, passin' a black
Which one of y'all don't know 'bout that?
I'm on my regular shit

[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]
Just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do
Yeah, doin' what I do, just doin' what I do, just doin' what I do

What else could you do? What else could Ab-Soul do?
Could Ab-Soul do the 9 to 5? Could you be a construction worker?
Or is it just, is it not gonna happen, like it's gotta be music
I mean, it's really all I got man
There's not too much else I wanna do
I'm not gonna say too much I can do
But it's not much else that I wanna do really, know what I mean?
This is really my passion, but I'm just gonna ride it out
Know what I mean? Whether I'm making minimum wage with it or whatever
Know what I'm sayin'? Shit, I'm broke, I still got a job right now


[Hook:]
I run the game (I run the game)
I run the show (Stop that)
When the curtain open, they be yelling Ab-soul (Go 'head)
And if you didn't (Know what?)
Then now you know (What's up?)
Asshole, Ab-Soul kick up flow
I got you

Back by popular demand, it's your man
Dot, tell them what I am -- (You's a motherfucking scoundrel)
Villainous, I don't care if you sensitive
I'm different -- my only proof of birth's a death certificate
Brain like a fried egg, dick long as my leg
I don't give a fuck though, but I love having sex
Hit my weed man up, told me all he had was stress
Rock, ask DT how he wanna handle this
Now I'm in the Nickersons but I ain't got no business here
Cause I could get killed cause of the colors on the shit I wear
Fuck it though, I'm in this bitch -- acting all hard
But watch me turn impotent as soon as niggas trip and shit
I only got one life and nigga I ain't risking it
I'll probably catch cancer by twenty-six
Smoke like a burning building, never choke and if I do
That's that killa, meaning, nigga that'll murder you
That's the fire on my chest dude
"Ab-Soul you smoke too much, how it affect you?"
One time, I got so high up in the sky
That I ran a couple laps then took a nap in the restroom
Get it? I took a nap in the restroom
I'm in the laboratory, sipping vodka out a test tube
And if anybody wanna throw shots or leave flesh wounds
Tell 'em I'll be in the streets with my cleats

[Hook:]
I run the game (I run the game)
I run the show (Stop that)
When the curtain open, they be yelling Ab-soul (Go 'head)
And if you didn't (Know what?)
Then now you know (What's up?)
Asshole, Ab-Soul kick up flow
I got you

Show-stopper, Carson globetrotter
Rhyme like popping a Glock, get low like Flo-Rida
You know that nigga Soul keep one in the chamber
Motherfuck a judge though, there's no justice for brothers
My nigga B Slim in the pen like permanent ink
And like my first LP, I'm waiting on his release
Machete sharp on you niggas every sixteen
I should charge per bar like a store that sell dumbbells
I ain't finna kiss the bride, but I'm finna unveil the truth
Niggas be trash like junk-mail in the booth
After who? Y'all know that
So I think I'm wasting a gift if y'all gon' rap
Am I the shit? Read my black ass lips
Like confessions of video vixens we all wanna hit
Kick it like a creative recreation on some everyday shit
And I don't even own a pair, but it's fair to say I

[Hook:]
I run the game (I run the game)
I run the show (Stop that)
When the curtain open, they be yelling Ab-soul (Go 'head)
And if you didn't (Know what?)
Then now you know (What's up?)
Asshole, Ab-Soul kick up flow
I got you

Hit you up like Pac
Then when you get to heaven ask Biggie who shot you
I pity you rap dudes, you niggas in my way
You're talking to the father, don't play Marvin Gaye
Better yet, I'm the author-slash-martyr with a probable cause
To ball harder than Coach Carter starters
Pack more green than the team that gave the boot to Brett Favre
And you could hear the horror in my aura
Monster, like the one under your bed
Say your prayers 'fore I shed through your epidermal layer
With intentions to hurt you like a technical foul player
Even in a scrimmage I make you hemorrhage
I got a scheme to get richer than movie screen depictions of Bruce Wayne
No bats, just game
In fact, you niggas wanna know why you're lame?
I gets more fly, you stay plain, how 'bout that?
More figures than your calculator could count
I got more flavor than garlic on niggas' recording
I hate y'all, I'm sick of rap
Punch, hit the space bar

Largo termino...
Long term, bitches
If you can compare yourself to anybody else in hip-hop who would it be?
And this is not comparing them to be side by side
This is somebody that you see great music inside them
And every time you hear them it makes you wanna work on your craft
Man, really I mean, I mean K Dot man, that nigga's a monster
K Dot?
That nigga's a monster
Uh, he's probably the only rapper still that gives me the chills at this point
Aside from like Hov or someone like that


Better off alone
Better off alone
It's real natural, supernatural if you may
Nobody to hold
Better off alone

Time is of the essence, that's how the saying goes
Can't stop for nothing, I gotta go
Gotta kick that shit and reach my goal
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
I don't know who I trust, I don't know who I know
I don't know who to hug, I don't know who to choke
Cause niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
I don't fuck around like sex on a merry-go
No, I bet my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas
Cause see

[Hook:]
They can't hate what they don't know
And they can't take what you don't show
I be better off alone
Say I be better off alone
Cause when I'm by myself I surprise myself
I could get where I'm goin', I could drive myself
With nobody to hold
Say I be better off alone

I'm movin' in slo-mo with little to no dough
It feels like everything I do is a no-go
And I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo
I ride solo
Cause I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo

My lady got me stressin', but I canât blame her no
She need more time, but I'm always in the studio
Random niggas beggin' for me to feature on they songs
I wanna tell them no, I'm workin' on my own
Success'll make ya true nigga true colors show
Sometimes your foes is friends, sometimes your friends is foes
Yeah niggas be funny style and I am not a joke
Like Cedric or any comedian you know
No, I bear my soul like a 40 calico
Aimin' at your skull-and-bones tell the reaper hello
Nice to meet ya, but I ain't no killer
I stay low like Shawty, far away from you niggas
Cause see

[Hook:]
They can't hate what they don't know
And they can't take what you don't show
I be better off alone
Say I be better off alone
Cause when I'm by myself I surprise myself
I could get where I'm goin', I could drive myself
With nobody to hold
Say I be better off alone

I'm movin' in slo-mo with little to no dough
It feels like everything I do is a no-go
And I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo
I ride solo
Cause I got friends, but all my friends could be so-so
Or the po-po and I never know, so
I ride solo

[Hook:]
They can't hate what they don't know
And they can't take what you don't show
I be better off alone
Say I be better off alone
Cause when I'm by myself I surprise myself
I could get where I'm goin', I could drive myself
With nobody to hold
Say I be better off alone

I like this right here, Punch
Feels right, know what I mean?
It's like one of them type of joints where you just
Spill your soul, know what I mean?
Just put your soul on a platter, know what I mean?
Or platter, excuse me
Supernatural, real things, real feelings, real emotions
Know what I mean?
Top Dawg Entertainment
Ab-Solo
Yeah, that's my new nickname, Ab-Solo
Dolo, let's get it


You know what I mean?
I think that, as soon as the trend leaves, you know to be a rapper
You know, which is coming soon, you know
We can get back to just, you know, gettin' new flavor, new talent
You know what I mean? People that's really out here doin' it
Cause we really do it, know what I'm sayin'
I live this
You're now listening to the beautiful sounds of Sounwave and Ab-Soul
Hey yo wizzle this shit sound real beautiful right here man
It's that real backpack rap shit right?
The cats that spin around on they head, they'll feel this
The niggas that walk around with they backpacks
Sayin' they love hip-hop
For real

5:30 in the morning I'm up
Cooking like a chef, rolling up a blunt
Momma say I need rest, I just need a puff
To put my mind in the clouds
With the birds and the planes and such, that's how I do it
Hit Wave up, lets make some music
It's therapeutic like lotion to bad skin
Heard there's a party later on, I should attend

[Hook:]
Cause I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
You might find me in the club with a mixed drink
Talking to the woman of your dreams, but just think
I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
Ab-Soul, sincerely yours
This is my song and that was the chorus

As you can see I make music for the people
Real is relative and we are all equal
I be in the lab like a scientist mad
At the world and I chemical react, to rap
How real is that? I'm on the grind
Like a synapse, keep that in mind
It's all facts, don't enter the line
Or you'll miss it
Much like a lover in the distance
Plus I'm persistent, gotta keep it moving
Like a army brat foreign exchange student
Keep a certain level of class, your ass truant
Hit the road buddy, I'm a home study
Cause I don't get out much
Like a maniac straight jacket strapped up
Now that was a stretch, but nevertheless
I'm in the booth like concession stand
Workers and I'm the truth
And she wanna rendezvous, but

[Hook:]
Cause I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
You might find me in the club with a mixed drink
Talking to the woman of your dreams, but just think
I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
Ab-Soul, sincerely yours
This is my song and that was the chorus

(You coming through tonight Soul?)
Of course!
That was Punchline from headquarters
He must have something for me
Beats by the batch, I can run through tracks
Ali can record me
Critics saying I'm the next Sean Corey
But I'm just Ab, like the muscle in your stomach
Trynna make history
Sit up and listen
As I kick victory in the mouth like women
She my main squeeze, like lemon
Add a little lime and you got yourself a Sprite
So I ain't thirsty for a function tonight
I'mma get it in, me and rap, she all I need
Cause you know me

[Hook:]
Cause I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
You might find me in the club with a mixed drink
Talking to the woman of your dreams, but just think
I don't get out much (I be in the studio)
Y'all ain't about much
Ab-Soul, sincerely yours
This is my song and that was the chorus

So what type of sound are you? What is Ab-Soul sounds?
I just say, human music
Cumin music
Human music, like my nigga K Dot said, know what I'm sayin'
It's a real thing, real feelings, real thoughts, real situations


[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm a soldier mane, thought I told ya mane
I aim and flame ya, I'm the pro-to-pane
Niggas sizing me up like I'm buying a tux
So I interrupt, crease 'em, iron 'em up
With the nina, not talking 'bout the two singers
Cause a leprechaun wouldn't even press his luck
I'm sure to pluck any chicken with a rhythm I could fuck
I tell 'em call me up
Like is it on or what, can I cut 'til dawn, or what?
A slut say she want a slice of all of us
Intelligent, say her marble's marvelous
She go down south like black colleges
I'm a psychologist, I tell her I can adjust
Anything in the world that be bothering her
Everywhere I go, guarantee she go
Pussy pop on the low like a silencer

[Bridge - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Hook - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Back to the realist shit, niggas ain't raw
You grilling, I'mma menage a woman and I
Barrage, be intimate, a massage beginning with
Caress from her tongue, deep throat raw
Lot's of trauma, ya baby momma
Brain is crazy: Jeffrey Dahmer
And I'm finna shoot like a dirty llama
Big truck kicking up dust: conquer
Chocolate seats: Willy Wonka
Passenger: Pretty Woman
Directed back, bring ya compass
You bringing Carson, you bringing Compton
Y'all bring the nonsense, we bring the real
Like pro tools, never gross 500 mil
And we out in Brazil, in the green like Blankas
Bonkers, tell 'em Top Dawg is here!

[Bridge - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Hook - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
I think it's that give us that back
Whatever war you bring, send me to Iraq
I rap like my tongue was sitting on a match
You struck by lightning, frightening, gotta be a Heisman
Trophy, lowkey, the one and only
Slay a ho, play a ho like an oldie
Yup, and I'm dope like Opi
Um, so I'm out when the police
Come, like a nut, I'm a nut
For the bucks like a shotgun bust, and I bust
Venom inside the brains of young dames
Like Mr. Dash speaking to his kids on Jay-Z
We running the game
Y'all slipping like run in the rain
Ya bitches running away from y'all to us
In God we trust, at y'all we bust

[Bridge - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Back to the realest shit, cop a car, mash that
Crash that, then I'm back at the dealership
Diamonds on my necklace, diamonds on my left wrist
Diamonds on my right wrist, damnit I'm the brightest
Back to the realest shit
You an exclamation, fuck an explanation

[Hook - Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar:]
Better watch yo lady!
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
(Boom!) Bounce (Boom!) Bounce
Better watch yo lady!


[Verse 1:]
See, I just wanna take my chopper
And aim it right at that copper
Just locked up my partner
...they can't stop us

I'm prolly all alone on this one [x4]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

I'm prolly all alone on this one [x2]
Prolly all on this one [x2]

[Hook:]
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel
Re...
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel
Re...

[Hook: Alori Joh]
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again

I might all alone on this one [x9]

[Verse 2:]
I just wanna grab that heater
Run right in the cathedral
Aim it right at that preacher
For miseducating the people

I might all alone on this one [x4]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

[Verse 3:]
I just wanna take that banger
And aim it right at my Maker
For placing me 'round all this danger
I can't even trust my neighbor

I know I'm all alone on this one [x5]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul & Alori Joh]
Inhale, exhale
Inhale, exhale

I know I'm all alone on this one [x3]

[Hook:]
Who's bold enough to rebel?
Re... bel
Re... bel

[Hook: Alori Joh]
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint, that's the jam
Turn it up, play it again
That's the joint
That's the jam
Turn it up
Play it again


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
My only fear is fear itself
I ain't afraid to die, more afraid of myself
Niggas looking at me like I don't hear myself
Like I don't know pain - I been here myself
(This life will drive you crazy)
Only if you let it
I'm just an American expressin' - Just give me credit
Won't be surprised if before I rise, I'm beheaded
These are the days of our lives
Nightmares of a thief comin' takin' my life
I go to sleep thinkin' I may never wake up
In this reality, at least I keep my bed made up
I just wish they all could see what I can see
If we could stop it with the violence and apply a lil' logic I believe
We could thrive to be a promise, see - Civilisation
We may die individually, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time, until it's our time

[Hook:]
(Don't be so afraid to die)
Until it's our time
(Don't be so afraid to die)
It's not time, till it's our time
(Cause we'll never die)

[Verse 2: Ab Soul]
All I see is confusion and chaos
Blatant disorder, authorities pickin' on the minorities
Unfortunately, the land of the free has little to offer me
And got me awfully thinkin' about offin' me
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being broke and even worse
The upper class acts like they want me off this earth
(This life will drive you crazy)
Only if you allow it
That's only if you a coward and you're sure to get devoured
To no avail, tuck your tail, and all you do is give them power
Who's gonna take a stand, who's gonna be a man?
Who do you work for? Please help me understand
You could be the victor in a situation
We may die individual, but as a nation
We'll rise, nigga, change lives, nigga
Break ties from the everyday lies, nigga
It's not time, until it's our time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Punch]
Pardon my immortality
I'm Martin Luther shooting back at the balcony
Escapin' in a Lorraine until they call in the cavalry
Out from 184, oh lord, nobody blast for me
If it takes me to be a martyr to push the envelope farther
Nigga show me to the slaughter
I gladly sacrifice what is percieved
Sow my seed, so my seed can live it's dreams
My spittin' image, see my stitching in his genes
According to my likeness, this breath of life is priceless
My enlightenment's the ancient Chaldeans
Penetratin' America's culture, to it's very being
It's not political though, it's more critical
Spiritual warfare, you can murder me in the physical
But I advise y'all to keep me alive
In the event of my demise, I'll be bigger than life
Beautiful death, nigga

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
Tragedy after tragedy, it's sad to see
America killin' her babies like Casey Anthony
We try, we try to cope and hold on to our sanity
Poppin' ecstasy will surely shorten life expectancy
We travel the seven seas in hopes for a little peace
We promised pie in the sky, I'm dyin' to get a piece
Put down your piece, I'm wish you all a beautiful death
Peace


[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Black lip bastard, pass me your password
So I can hack inside your brain, see I too have gone insane
Before I fall I'm sure to curse you all in Jesus' name
Lead shower, and a pebble hour bitch stand the rain

Look inside my parking garage and see a collage
Of every person I despise since the moment I turned 5
Calculate my steps and strategically took my time
Even falling off, I land on the ass of Nicki Minaj
Eat that pink pussy like it's Friday
Bust one, Roman Reload, then smoke to Sade
And somebody tell Rihanna too
I need that vagina too
Don't fucking take me for some kind of fool
I'm kinda the reminder of knowin' Compton ain't kinda cool
Good kid, mad city, mountaintops couldn't see my views
Counter-tops, we hop over, hit the register then we move
I hope this shit can register on a regular soon
Before I climb this pedestal and make you catch my fucking stool bitch
K.Dot, leave 'em grieving on evening news
Even when society break even, I'll break rules

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I told niggas, caught wrecked, and then I towed niggas
Fold niggas like clothes and drawers nigga
Homie chose to go toe-to-toe, I had to break his leg
Like a cliche to rock a show, is that over your head?
Niggas stretchin' the truth like they choose to do yoga instead
Either that or that or they depressed, eatin' yogurt in bed
Solar system, grab a space shuttle and stay subtle
The bass bit the bait, I'm straight, you a gay couple
I ain't thirsty for the deal, wait and make em' pay double
Anxious when I'm banking on the table I need a muzzle
You're basic like cable to a satellite dish
You was runnin' LA, now you out of there like Fish
What more can I say? I'm a bastard with black lips
Black shirt, black shades, long black dick
I'm awkward dog, I'm trynna bargain shop at Saks Fifth
Swung two axes and knocked the Earth off axis

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Figg side, black nine, black lips, smoke time
Fuck this rap shit I'm actin

Suckin' on titties since I was 8
Hoodie with my shades I ain't trynna be fake
So don't be talking to me pussy
Runnin' your gums like you be loc'ing
When the world know that you're nookie
Rookie, softer than if you fabric
I won't have it, when the gun drawn get rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tatted
Know my niggas movin'
You hesitatin' to hit the lick, what the fuck is you doin'

[Verse 4: Ab-Soul]
Perpetratin', bitches poppin' percocet and percolatin'
Freelance for God but do the work of Satan, whatever works
I'm clever with the words if you haven't noticed yet
Lightyears ahead, I'm bright and I like to get oral sex
Soul brother number 1+1, gettin' fed like where drugs and guns come from

[Verse 5: Jay Rock]
All we do is do it, shittin' on the competition
Taking heads off, this Hannibal Lecter music
You niggas don't move me, you niggas just movies
Cut straight to them credits and hit you with' a uzi
Peel off in a dooney, truck bed full of toolies
Get home, smoke, and poke on some coochie
I'm just fuckin' around, enough with them fairy tales
But I bust heads for real, go head -
I'm Jay Rock, you norm' niggas beneath me
How you gon' dance with the devil, with two left feet?
Peep, thinkin' you sweet but you weak
Talkin out of turn'll leave all of your teeth in the street
Momma taught you better, never clash with a giant
Unless you David, remember my nigga, I'm not goliath
Feel the wrath of this titan, hit some water call it Poseidon
Wig out, then hit your ass with a trident
Money on the table my nigga, you know I'm all in
If rap was a drink, you wine nigga, I'm all gin
Hunnit' proof, recruit a hunnit' troops who love to shoot
No fluke my nigga, you know that's what us hunters do
East side up, Watt city mayhem
Choppers that sprayin' from AM to PM
I'm the silent assassin of the four-headed dragon
Black Hippy blastin' a 50 out the back of the Benz Wagon
Toe tagging wack rappers off GP
You can't see me, your vision ain't 3D
You smokin' on that seaweed, we rollin' up that kiwi
In the backwood lightin', we high for like 3 weeks
You payin' for that pussy but we always get freebies
Top Dawg that ho and throw it like a frisbee, it's history
You know the night and day is ours
Top Dawg Conglomerate, HiiiPower, bitch


[Intro:]
One time for the women
Hit ya two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
That's right

[Verse 1:]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just living how I'm living
Patron with a lemon, Pinneapple in the Ciroc
Vanity, more homes than the Sherlock family to roll through
Smoke up, fuck with a broad or two
I'm broader than you, (Murda!) I'm slaughtering you
She ain't gotta be a genius to see it
I just hope the brain make me say Jesus Christ
No religion, I'm just so explicit
I coexist in places you would never know existed
(What, what) Soulo here
Take a photo like a 4-seater
Top notch to my fucking socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, that's reasonable
If she pop a Xanny and give me the panties

[Hook:]
She'll never leave me alone
Shit, I swear I just met shorty like 40 minutes ago, and it's a go
Man I hope she don't think I think she a ho
Got me harder than sneaking a bitch in Bohemian Grove
One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
The bitches

[Verse 2:]
Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just living how I'm living
Hennesey and Coke, 1800
We mixing dark and light like the 1800s
And we getting blunted, what it do? Yes, indeed
Bet I got some weed like Schoolboy Q
Let the festivities begin, we in here (what), we in here (what), we in here
Where them hoes at? I'm sincere as Nasir
Belly of the beast, I might feast on my dear
We night ride like Paul Revere
Spilling Mai Tais all on her brasiere
Top notch to my fucking socks
Say I'm not, you smokin' rocks
She on my jock, put the key in the door
If she pop a percocet and give me the sex

[Hook]

Hey baby, I been thinking of you, hey baby, I been thinking of you
Hey baby, I been thinking of you, hey baby, I been thinking of you
Look at my mind, floating away
I get so illuminati

Motherfuck the government, motherfuck the system
Motherfuck you I'm just livin how I'm livin

Control [x3]
Stimulate the hoes
Control
Educating my niggas
Control [x2]


One time for your mind

[Verse 1:]
He with the homies, he with the homies
No squares in his circle, nobody phonie
He with the homies, he with the homies
We don't love them hoes, let's get this money
He got a main chick, been with her for a while
Love making, and making out
His fellas in his ear, "you acting like a queer"
You going on dates, we tryna get this cake
The pressure be setting in
If you a real man, you would fuck her friend
Head saying no, other one saying yes
His girl girlfriend been with it, it's scandalous
Unfasten her clothes, is what you gonna tell his soul
The thrill of it all got him off, case closed
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"

[Hook:]
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard
Tired of living, living, living
By this double standard, standard, standard

[Verse 2:]
She with the girls, she with the girls
Hair done, nails done, no care in the world
She with the girls, she with the girls
They all wifey material, yes sir
She want a boyfriend, she been missing out
On love making and making out
But she ain't having the best luck
Everybody who chop it up only want a cut
One of her girlfriends got one
She been jealous of the relationship since day one
But last week he made a pass at her
She knew she had him, her ass a little fatter
Unbutton his jeans and then she fell to her knees
She finally found company for her misery
He hesitated, and she say "why you push me?
If you don't get this pussy, then you a pussy"

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
See the moral of the story is
She a ho, he a pimp
Old girl'll forgive her man
But her girlfriend's cut off like Edward's hands
What's fucked up is he got at her
Bitches call her a rat, but shit she's heard worse
To my niggas having bitches, it's what you just do
To the bitches having niggas, this what a slut do
My auntie told me always treat my lady right
My uncle told me only love 'em for a night
You can see the immediate disconnection
Between a man and a woman, the reason for aggression
For example, you heard of Amber Cole
But you don't know that nigga that was getting dome
I'm saying we heard of Amber Cole
But we don't know that lil' nigga that was getting dome

It's just my interpretation of the situation

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I got seven hundred dollars from my last show
And I would spend it all on you
So baby won't you fall on through
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
It's been a little while since the last time I saw you
What's up with you and ol' dude
I hope everything is all cool
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...

[Alori Joh:]
Can you feel, what I feel
When I feel, What I feel
Empathy... Empathy...

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Lady if you would just give me the time
You could just leave all your problems behind
You got a past, but that's in the past
And we all know that, you can't press rewind
I understand, where are you and
I lend you a hand, if you wanted mine
Pamper you and stand for you
The man to, make everything right

[Verse 3: Javonte & Absoul]
I guess things ain't going as well as you expected
But baby don't stress it, I hope you learned a lesson
Empathy... Empathy...
Empathy... Empathy...
I tell you I've been down that road before
If anyone can feel you then it's me
So won't you let you garments hit the floor
And let me let you feel me
Lights please, lights please
Light-skinned, mighty fiesty
Oh oh, I see, I see
You like me too

[Hook: Alori Joh & Ab-Soul]
Can you feel, I feel, I feel
Empathy


[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end
Up happening, I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive and put me after Em
I'm a fucking genius
Gripping my fucking penis, living this life
You can't tell me nothing
Still ain't really got no money fucking right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearing Polo drawers
Put 2 chains on and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild
Too damn proud
Been killing this since Cam made Oh Boy
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Rest in peace, you just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say when I wanna say it, okay then
Further more we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin' but it pays great
That is until you lose appeal
And your release date gets date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fifth and a loaf of bread
Feed the people, food for thought
Because we are equal, who'd have thought

[Hook: Ab-Soul & Kendrick]
They wanna share my light [x8]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light [x2]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
Now I feel like I'm runnin' laps around Jay-Z
Nas ain't seen nothing this nasty
B.I.G. & Pac got it coming when I pass too
You got the mic, I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPoWeR on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for 10 bucks too
Too I'll when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch and that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though
Like Cold get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes
On P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty
The best author ever to breath
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losing no sleep
No, no at them no doors
Just know "No" if it's no dough
So high but I'm Soulo
Two cups and I sip slow
Taking my time
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show
Now let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time I drop line for line
But only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine
And cop 30 nines and cock back and kill
See the truth is, they wanna know how close me, Dre and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this to be 2Pac
But truth I give two shits 'bout
Expectations or critics hating
Shit, I just put moms on vacation
Bitch you never know my new location, it's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the motherfucking King dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness
The Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tip like Kinta Kunta
Black is back bitch I'm the the coupe-da
Black on black crime resent the shooter
Black, black, black, I intend to mute you
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game so please don't ask me about no pressure
Bitch see the grip on my fingertip I can hold this coast together

[Hook]


[Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid (and Ab-Soul)]
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Me) Your body's calling
Your body's calling
(Gimme some of that, gimme some of that that)
Your body's calling
Your body's calling me

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Alright, I know what you like, I know what you want
I know what you need, I know how to put you out your misery
A-B (dash) S-o-u-l
Infinity when it comes to the possibilities
Anytime you're in my vicinity
And I'll beat it, yeah I'll beat it up, yeah I'll beat it up
Just like it's my enemy, all night
I can't resist, I need it like my pancreas
If you dismiss and no give me kiss kiss, it'll be hard digesting it
Gimme some of that, gimme some of that
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
Back it up til a nigga say that's enough
Mirror on the ceiling, everything looking up
Sweetie, I'm trying to get it in like a suite key
Your skin like sweet tea, I need thee
Look sweet thing, you remind me of my jeep, your body's calling
She got work but I think she finna call in, cause I'm all in that thang
And she probably think I'm in love the way I'm falling in that thang
Soulo

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
This strange thing got me leaning
This reefer keep on steaming
And I believe that everything happens for a reason
And girl you got me fiending
I don't care about your religion
Cause I just can't resist you
God damn lust demons

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock, Rock
Leaning like a motherfucker, I be pouring
(Black Hippy Shit) higher than a motherfucker, I be blowing
I'm off that Amber Kush with a bad little bitch call it Amber Rose
She be loving the crew and I be loving her too
She got a thang for them rap niggas I suppose
She feeling my energy
I feel on her thighs, she fill up the Henessey
Now we on the sofa, in a minute I'm a be bending her over
She know my motives, tryna get behind me like a locomotive
She trained, she on the right track
Yeah she got that boomerang then I'm coming right back
She ratchet nasty
She got a ring on her tongue and a ring on her clit
Got my hands on my YKK, sip it down, now she all on my tip
She told me, look at me when I work my magic daddy
She pulled a rabbit out a hat
Made my dick disappear, in thin air
Then she brought it right back

[Hook]


[Hook: x2]
One time for my niggas poured up yup, bachelor
We get screwed up like the neck of Frankenstein
Purple weed, purple drank, purple swag, purple tag
We be getting dough, We be getting dough

[Verse 1:]
Just copped a pack of backwoods, I'm sitting high as hell
This OG kush suits this honey very well
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got her foe, that's right I'm tryna get dough
Hit my nigga AJ, heard he bought an 8th
My nigga Legend blessed me with a cup the other day
Hit my nigga Carver D, Dough boy it ain't crack?
Tell him it's a pole party, ASAP
Bumping out the speakers, coffee cups with lids
This way nobody accidentally ashin' in my shit
Got a few two liters and it's about to go down
Then again it's the prescription of choice
Just call us the Finnegan boys
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2:]
I got this funny little dream of buying out the bar
Then flexing in my section like a fucking star
They ask me what I like to drink and I say I'm alright
Then all you see is my purple sprite, glistening off of the strobe light
No jolly ranchers, this ack? is all I need
I hope it ain't clichÃ© to shoot Pimp C a RIP
As well as DJ Screw since I made up this tune about lean
But as of late, all I see is poe like Section 8
The homie say he's got a few tings
That's three 16s and a whole lot of cream
I crack a ceiling, drope a douce now I got mixed emotions
From here on out, it's slow motion
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know, but you have no idea
The lights are low, the mood is right
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
Who got a Sprite? Who got a Sprite?
I got a foe, who got a Sprite?
I do all this shit, just to say get off my dick
You think you know

[Outro: x2]
Coming down, still sipping
Draped up dripped out, still sipping


[Intro:]
Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

[Verse 1:]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
I can't even take a piss without a nigga trying to take a pic
I just want to fuck a few hoes, take my pick
Backwoods with the hash in 'em bad bitch, skinny jeans, fat ass in 'em
You ain't never seen a lime of light
I might fuck around and do a line tonight
Codine cups, paint a picture so vivid
Fucking to the Weeknd, on the weekend
That ain't too provocative, is it?
If it's not, that's just a warning
You know I got it if you want
No, I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No this shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something

[Hook:]
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights
It's always something
The cars, the clothes, the ice
It's always something
The stars, the moon, the lights

Why everything supposed to be bad, make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would

[Verse 2:]
I wish a nigga would try to take my shit
Cause a nigga wish he could do it like this
We in the world of material vixens in your videos
Hermes belt, shirt will make your ho melt
Issey Miyake all over my body
My heart beats off beat, still the life of the party
YSL, iPhone wireless cell
I'm high as hell, by the end of the night
I might need bail if a nigga test my mic
I ain't a bitch for nothing, end of discussion
And I couldn't tell you how the world function
But I'm headed to the function
This shit ain't about nothing
No that shit ain't about nothing
But it's gotta be something
They say I'm so selfish
I ain't think about nothing
Unless it's making me something
Matter fact fuck that
I ain't worried about nothing
No, I ain't worried about nothing
It's always something

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
Uh, It was all a dream, I swear it never happened
I wrote like Edgar Allen, I was po' like Edgar Allen
Let me hit the weed, you know I really need that
Missing screws, bending rules like kneecaps
I don't even know what's real, I'm just being real
Making moves, you just another human being; being still
Play the fool, you jealous dudes are just a plate of food
Tell the truth, I'm the coldest cat, sabertooth
Blaze the booth, blaze the buddah, this ain't hookah
You hit this shit a few times, you might see the future
Ask my nigga Blocka, we be rolling up that Blanka
Just retire, if I light this fire I might blow your block up

[Hook:]
Enjoy your mind trip but don't trip on your mind
No man is safe from the war going on outside
That's right, you ever been conscious in a coma?
Please don't tell my mama this ain't marijuana
I might be tripping off that DMT
TDE, Limitless like we on NZT
I made my dreams reality, so to speak
Or so they say, I could still be asleep

[Verse 2:]
The black sheep running with a pack of wolves
Diamond in the rough, tell Brock I need a pack of woods
Two white cups full of codeine
Plus I got two white sluts down to blow me
Can't you see I'm floating, like root beer and ice cream
My synapses act like lightning, probably why I'm so enlightening
Probably why these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm lookin like "who the fuck invited them?"
They failed in testing like what's inside of them
(Soulo, Soulo) Say it like you mean it
My demeanor is the meanest, I'm gettin meaner by the minute
It's mine, I spend it, my mind is spinning
Your time is ticking, the sky's the limit
We in a space where matter don't matter
Just spirit molecules and geometric patterns
Shitted in a crater last time I sat on Saturn
Got a letter from Andromeda, they tryna shrine my bladder

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm in a whole 'nother realm, go to hell
Last nigga tried to scratch the surface broke a nail
Last nigga tried to cross the line got crucified
We overseas, back-to-back, never wore Chanel
The new nucleus never sitting in a cell
Genius idiot, best description of myself
I'm in a fucking lab coat rhyming as high as shit
When I die, donate my organs to science bitch

[Outro: x3]
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, three eyes, three eyes
You got three eyes, but you can never see us


[Intro:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love

[Verse 1:]
Pants still saggin' to the floor, saggin' through your turf
Like I own this fuckin' earth, I saw my fuckin' life
I'm just livin' fuckin' life, This ain't house Party 5
But what's poppin' for tonight? I got a 'lil more dough to spend
This Rest in Peace up on the LB like Nate did
Y'all ain't smokin' y'all jokin', Nugs big as Chuckie Cheese tokens and I'm tokin'
Bomb House on Skid Row ain't this potent, holy shit
I'm God-Sent, admire my skit, callate la voca in the presence of the most high (power)
Most high (power), Most high (power)
Yea you heard me right, true achiever, new ADIDAS still tryna earn my stripes

[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]

[Verse 2:]
It's easy to assume we doin' decent, true indeed
I'm not from here, I'm of Heaven descent
Were you the Prius, sure it's one, it's two, it's 3
You'd have this music down to a Tee if you was me
It's 36 O's in a Ki, it's only one in Ab -Soul
Still open do's, Don't forget the dash
I might leave you with a gash, I ain't doin' no more shows unless I'm gettin' cash
Feelings full of Hash, city on my back nigga
Fucked around and put the llama on the map
Carson, Californication no travel agent
But every day's a vacation and mothafuckas hate it
I flew in, but I ain't complanin'
And everyday I'm rainin' got the most precipitation
Soul-o, Top Dawg Administration
Top Notch, Crock Pot Hot, where's your apron
Stop, watch, grab a stop watch and pry patience
And watch us pop across the population

[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]

[Verse 3:]
Do that shit, we done that shit
You new to this, we run that shit
Go and tell em Soul told em, lick a scrotum suck a dick
Down for what I'm up against, clownin' when you see me
Stylin' jokin', smilin' sculpture poker face, through these black shades (Smokin' on Haze)
In the middle of the bar, at least I think so I can't quite remember where we are
All I see is stars nigga, All I see is stars
I don't know if I'm on the red carpet or on Mars
Shout out to my bitches givin' it up on the first date, Between 21 & 38 (Great)

[Hook:]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]
For all my niggas doin' drugs, fuckin' hoes and showin love
Do that shit, we done that shit, you new to this, we run that shit [x2]


[Intro:]
(Soulo taught me...)
See yeah my nigga see
See yes this where that sci-fi met swag my nigga
Like the Holy Bible and a Gucci Bag
My nigga, swag!

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Oh you the kid, I'm Joseph Kony
Chip off the block, it's puffy socks in my Saucony
I touch stock, she suck cock
She dancing Secret Sundays and I'm 'bout to pray
I'm smoking dope, I'm smoking dope
She got that magical vaginal let me hocus poke
Row, row, row my boat gently down your stream
She into Alexander McQueen but she ain't met the king
(Soulo, SOULO, Soulo, SOULO) kiss the fucking ring ho
TDE we got the belt, "hold it down if nothin else"
And this is my new single, cut the cheese it's bout to melt
Lean in my cup, pinky up like Dr.Evil
Currently we seeing deeds like Adam Sandler
ScHoolboy Q, OG, and dirty pineapple Fanta
And I ain't never been a motherfucking lick 'less I'm right around the clit
Druggys with' hoes, O's and 4â²s

[Hook: x2]
I'm smokin dope, yo, could smell it on my clothes
SOPA tryna censor internet, we tryna get this dough
I said look back at me when you hit the pole
Swag's so mean, on them fucking hoes

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Oh that's your bitch? Well bruh she on me
I made her lick my sack, then work the top, then fuck the homies
Got the block hot, 'cause I sold it off
No I'm not Weezy, bitch I'm weezy from that chronic cough
Yeah, I'm smoking dope, you can smell it in my beard
Have no fear, saviour of the gangster rap is fucking here
Word around town, SOPA tryna shut it down
How that sound I'm from the underground
They're gonna make me slang a pound
Figg Row (Figg Row) Figg Row (Figg Row)
Bitch, what you know about Figg Row (Figg Row)
This is original gangster, Uh, uh, uh, yeah
Smoke it, chewed it, sniff it, smell it
Inhale it, sip it, whatever
Just mix dope with your flavor uh, uh, uh, yeah
In interviews they always asking me about a lisp
Knowing damn well I'm looking like I'm slinging bricks
Ever seen an ex-student get a half a ticket
Think I'm lying? just ask Jimmy, that check was mine to...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q]
Soulo ho! Groovy Q!
I'm high as fuck, look at me too
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Fendi on, I might throw a fit
Deadline, hoodie on like Trayvon
Heard it through the grapevine
We got extra pills, lean and shrooms
Life for me is just weed and brews
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it) Don't stop! (Get it, get it)
Don't stop! (Get it, get it, get it, get it, get get)

(Soulo taught me)


[Intro:]
This is a story about control, my control
Control of what I say, control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way
I hope you enjoy as much as I do
Are we ready? I am, because it's all about control
And I've got lots of it

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Soulo ho, the one and only
You niggas know me, your bitches want me
Determination, I got a grip, 9-5 locs I am not a Crip
Blood, sweat and tears, hotel tiers
Your short term tall tales won't sell here
And Ms. Aiko told me let my soul sail here
Let me get a 'hell yeah'

Open your eyes
You niggas know what it is
It's about that time
Soulo ho?
You niggas know what it is
It's been a hell of a ride
You niggas know what it is
We live one hell of a life
So Soulo ho?

[Verse 2:]
Manipulating minds, reciprocating times
Split on my
Said I was the underdog, turns out I'm the secret weapon
We can see you half-stepping, I should somersault
Some are salty that I made it in the way I did
Cause I really did everything I say I did
Let me tell you why I'm vexed
The same reason why I'm stressed, the same reason why I'm blessed
I stopped playing, and I started planning
I stopped playing, and I made it happen
We mapped it out, and now the map is ours
Raised my stats off of records, check an almanac
Thank God punchline knew I had a knack
Down two die to get my point across like craps
Control System, cut off your radios, cut off your television


[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though
Kick your game, spit your flow
Can't fuck with this Top Dawg shit though

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Wish I could see out Haile Selassie' eye
Maybe my sovereignty would still be mine
If all the gangs in the world unified
We'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight
I said we'd stand a chance against the military tonight

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Babylon, Babylon
At my window all I see is Babylon
On the news all I see is Babylon
And all niggas do is just babble on
Money and hoes, want money and hoes
If I sold dope, I'd have plenty of flows
I was from the projects like Jay Rock
I woulda more than likely slang rocks
All my life I done been around Crips and Bloods
Pimps and thugs - just to name a few
I do drugs, Mama say it's in my blood
But she don't know what the fuck I've been through
To creep through the back door, the typical black boy in the good old U-S-A
Before I pushed rhymes like weight, I used to wanna play for the NBA
Fuck I'm doing talking bout pineal gland
Ancient ways it's Sumerian
Ain't nothing wrong with a righteous man
This why I had to write this man
For my niggas on the corner
Selling water to somebody's daughter
Fluctuating prices man
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I-I just wanna be free
I ain't tryna be nobodies chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Extra pills, Extra pills
Them AK Clips they extra peel
Smoking on some of that extra kill
Purple Urkel, that Jaleel
I put that on errythang
If we could link up erry gang
And niggas is willing to bear the pain
We'd put the White House lights out today
Okay-kay-kay
We guarded like we the black KKK
Don't forget my AK-a Mayday
Pee on your P-H-D or your AA
Dear Barack
I know you just a puppet but I'm giving you props
You lying to the public like it ain't nothing
And I just love it, I hope it don't stop
I don't give a damn, nigga bang that block
I don't give a fuck, nigga bang that Glock
I seen an image of Hitler in the picture
When the twin towers dropped
Peep the concept
You've got progress, you've got congress
We protest in hopes they confess
Just proceed on your conquest
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't finna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobodies chattel

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Extra pills, extra pills
Nose 'Candy Rain' like Soul for Real
My baby need some enfamil
So bask in stuff like Oprah green
Pull around, come back, oh forreal?
Talk blue off low for some teal
Get lined up like homeless meals
Filling, if I know how being homeless feels?
Okay-kay-kay
Don't try to stop it, get in my way
You'll get stomped like a Broadway play
AK-melee, make her obey, okay?
Feel my pain, going insane, I'm ashamed
Cause I ain't got shit but an EBT card from a fiend
That owe me and it's in her daughter name
How the fuck is they pose to eat?
How the fuck am I pose to eat?
Got a nigga in the streets, no health care
Tryna slang weed just to put shoes on his feet
So fuck you, you don't give a fuck about me
Can't get a job cause they drug test me
Got a nigga stressed oppressed
Got a feeling in his chest
And the world's stripped of happiness
I ain't got no gavel
I ain't tryna fight nobody battle
I just wanna be free
I ain't finna be nobodies chattel


Your momma told me read the Book of Job
They shoulda called it the Book of Soul
I came into this hurtful Earth in perfect health
Caught StevensâJohnson syndrome when I was ten years old
Internal and external fever, 80%
Fatality rate at that time, ain't that some shit
Severe pink eye, my eyes swollen shut
For like two or three months, it's still bright as fuck
Oh, and I even lost my lip skin
Grew back darker than its original pigment
Skin disfigured from boils and blisters
Unidentifiable by my little sister
Come to think of it, I could've got a crazy check
The shrink thought I'd be traumatized, but I'm alright
My first years of Junior High School were not alright
Them dimes wouldn't give me no time, no, not a nod
I mean not even you, we eventually got cool
But I was nobody, you was the hottest hottie in the school
Or the world to me, not saying that cause I'm your dude
I'm glad I got to watch the woman that you blossomed to
Ironic we always had the same classes
I copied off your work, and you ain't always had
The right answers but it worked, mama, thanks a lot
Probably wouldn't have even graduated had you not
Somewhere down the line, we became an item
The love was in the air like this flight I'm lighting
The first few years was so exciting
Got deeper in this rap and started pushing shit back
My money got funny, you wanted to go on dates
I had a Soundwave beat tape tryna beat Drake
Could've spent every minute with you but I had to get it
For me and you, you sing too so you knew the business
I know it was hard but you stayed down
My fam had doubts, you told me you was proud
I did some things, you did some things, always came back together
We knew the only way to make it work was work together
Seven whole years, seven whole years
It was supposed to end with our grandkids
Luckily for me I'm used to being cut short
I'm such a nice guy, why, Lord?
Why Lori? Why'd you have to take her from me?
I guess He needed your angel face for all of heaven to see
Your picture's still on my mirror, and it's so scary
I swear, I still ain't looked at your obituary
So now I'm so doped up, I think I'm flyin'
I hope the spliff'll never finish
I guess the Mayans wasn't lyin'
2012, my world ended
You used to say that I could see the future
You was wrong, cause you was in it
And I was just with you the day before
You said you loved me, I said I loved you more
And as much I wanna cower and bid the mic adieu
And fall off a fucking tower tryna find you
I gotta stay cause I remember that day
I looked you in the face and told you
"Nothing can stop me, not even you"
Stick to the plan, I'll meet you at our spot
If reincarnation is true and we don't get too lost
Even if you forget me and everything you left behind
I never lied, I love you in a place where there's no space and time
I close my eyes and I can still hear you singing loud
We never got to tell them who The Love Religion was about
I ain't finna stage a cry in this rhyme
Signed, sincerely yours, I live to let you
Shine

[Interlude]

Everything I love the most gets taken away
My momma and music is next
And if that happens before I turn 28
Then I'm going out with Kurt Cobain
I still believe in God, we just ain't never spoke
Unless we talkin' symbolically, then I might agree
But if you really wanna look at it that way
Then, hey, man, God don't like me
I refuse to believe that, but what's acceptable
Is anything's possible, but nobody's special
My ma took my TV, Clem took my radio
Now I'm on TV and on the radio
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul
Don't be dethroned by these systems of control
Just keep your fingers crossed and get them locks off your soul

(Soul!)


[Intro:]
B-O, what up my nigga?
E3 I'm a get you on these backwoods last thing I do nigga
Yeah
Oh shit nigga! Oh shit nigga!
These niggas done did it again
Tae Beast why you do that man?
Why the fuck you had to do that man?
This shit sound like a 100 birds under the Carson Sheriff Station
I told Rizac I get off my stash
We really out here my nigga!

[Verse 1:]
When I roll through the city it give me a rush
Yeah I'm high off life but I'm rolling blunts
And they couldn't wait for Soul to reappear
Click, boom. T.N.T., TDE, we in here
Mm, mm, mm! I can smell fear
From a mile away, you might as well get from round here
I run the town like Roc Nation, no exaggeration
Bet I rise like Lazarus, use your imagination
Fascinated by you faggots hating
Get an occupation
You in violation, provoke annihilation
Flow like the Nile river, yo it's now or never
You had a release date, but now it's never
Yeah, welcome to the Control System
I'm stimulating the hoes and educating my niggas
I wiggle through potholes, my destination is vivid
To the end of the road I'm driven
Y'all trippin'
Soulo

[Hook:]
And we stunting like
Ab-Soul, abstract, asshole
Give the people what they need
Damn right, let 'em know
You got some kind of disease
I'm the illest in the business
If you ain't with the business, mind your business
And we stunting like
Ab-Soul, abstract, asshole
Give the people what they need
Damn right, let 'em know
You got some kind of disease
I'm the illest in the business
If you ain't with the business, mind your business
And we stunting like

[Verse 2:]
Like I ain't never had shit
Cause I never had shit
Same Chucks, two years straight, doing bad shit
Sick, twist two spliffs out my dime bag shit
Pissed, tryna get a good response out this bad bitch
Which one of you niggas wanna call my bluff?
Wish granted, call his ass granite, now he mopped up
Never been locked up but I keep a sentence
Winners win and sinners sin only to ask God forgiveness
In this world of luxury cars, illegal tender
Johnny want me like Wyclef Jean gone til' November
Pop my collar like I'm Don Juan, green to my slippers
Just remember that they don't want me to get ignorant
Sinister literature, given from this wicked minister
Witness your future diminish
No present from Saint Nicholas in particular
You're just a thing of the past
I'm a diamond ring in the trash
No reason to brag, it's Ab

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Can't lose, you niggas must admire defeat
You lying like Nala nigga, you know where to find a nigga
Del Amo, Carson in the house
The View, The Village, Scottsdale and right back around
Can't forget about The Patch, matter fact
I got some homies off Grace Ave., we go way back
Been running round since L train cut up at our people
Rocket was my role model, Lil' Rocket my number one O-migo
With fifteen in the back alley
Hop fences and skip school
Fellowship with the gang members, and goddammit I still do
But just imagine if Einstein got high and sipped juice
Broke rules, got pussy, beat up rookies on Pro Tools
You probably call his ass Soul Brother #2
And I just took a number two
And ain't this track number two?


[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going

[Verse 1:]
Starving artist, rib-cage showing
Give me the loot or give a semi to shoot
Then after, pass the Absolut
I'm trying to hit a lick, probably knock out your tooth
I'm fully equipped with a [?]
Finna get a nigga for every cent if that makes sense
Uh, head shot, you're dead Ock
If feds knock alibi [?] I was on [?] block
You niggas ain't ready for me to get in the mischief
Grimmy with it I hope the motherfucking disk skip
What?! You niggas think you better than me?
Cause you got more cheddar than me? Huh?
You ain't a spitter cause you got a lot of followers on twitter
My body of work would probably embody your Godzilla
I ain't a jerk, I'm an asshole
An I don't wanna hear you rap unless your cash flowing

[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going

[Verse 2:]
Shit, and I'm a mad muthafucka with a loaded clip
Do the math muthafucka!
That's 15 bullets in a nine and one in the chamber, hit you right between the eyes
And even if you live you can't defy the odds
Catch you while you're checking your safe, SUPRISE!
Oh, you thought I was playing with you?
Your man look sleepy so he gon be laying with you
I should've told you muthafuckas straight from the start
Got the flame, if I aim it'll burn you to ashes
Got the blunt rolled all I need is a spark
And watch the paramedic roll up with elastic
Stretcher carry your ass they'll bury you fast
You venereal and a dick head, how bout that?
Blowing more O's than a Cherrio cereal bag
Serial killa for the skrilla; maniac
And like when the camera take a picture I'm finna snap
Your fucking head off your neck then reattach it back
Brainacs get they mind blown
Can't have a migrane when your mind gone

[Hook:]
When the chips are down, the funds are low
And nobody's around to pull you out of this hole
Can you hold your own?
If you ain't got a dollar to your name can you maintain?
Can you hold you own when the going gets tough?
The tough get going

[Verse 3:]
Down to my last and my ship is sinking fast
I ain't looking for the sympathy, I'm looking for the cash
I ain't looking for my enemey but if he in the way I put the pistol in his mouth
Let him get a taste
Fore you eat say grace, you know I'm coming with the blammer
Not to shoot, just to use it to beat you like a case
What's the root of all evil? A baker said the cake
Gardner said the green, you know what I mean?
I'm sick of digging in my pocket for nickels and dimes
Somethings got to change or I'm resorting to crime
P95 in my palm.45 in my waist
You got a diamond? Run it or nobody's safe
Bill Gates is rich and Ab-Soul is poor
I'll rob his old ass from his head to toe
And as a matter of fact I'm finna blow a bank up
Mindstate of a nigga that went bankrupt!


[Verse 1:]
"Herbert Anthony you need to get you life together"
That's my momma bothered by how I live life like whatever
They say I'm pressed for time, but I don't press the issue
I just stay on my grind, chain smoking marijuan help me free my mind
What a coincidence, like feeling guilt trickin by your innocence
In a sense I'm livin in my second childhood
Don't pay a lick of rent, rhyme, eat, sleep, and shit
And when you twenty-two that don't sound good
Maybe if I went to school it'll be cool
I've have something to fall back on if this rap don't crack
Perhaps I'd have a better story had I sold crack
Let's go back, to Carson high fluctuating my goals
Writing rhymes through the lecture knew I should've took notes
Sometimes I think I'm running in place, chasing hopes
Rejoice my name as Ab-Soul or is it average joe

[Hook: x2]
All this commotion goes in one ear, out the other
I'm still gone make it, one way or the other

(Quit acting like a kid herb, gone be a man
It's a man's world, how you suppose to feed your fam
You need to act more like an adult, pull up your pants
I know you do music but what's your plan B man)

[Verse 2:]
If I knew when I was younger would I grew to know
I coulda tackle things more different, coulda been more defensive
Coulda been more responsible, coulda been more persistent
But I didn't and I ain't repenting
My parents wake up in the morning to a cup of coffee
Then go off to work it kills'em when I'm still in bed snoring
Only if they knew, their young boy was in the stu
'Til like 5 AM cookin up classics to make them
Proud it's house niggas that could stay in
That was rather rash, but you can replace this scraps with straight cash
I told jay I'm a buy you a house one day
I probably send Katie & [?] to college too
But right now I'm broke as a joke, I should do comedy
Dude, I need a job, somebody hire me fast
So I could win my girl over, she probably cheatin on my ass
You motherfuckers better try and snatch her while she up for grabs

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul talking]
It's like real difficult to articulate it
It's like you got your goals, you got your aspirations
Your dreams, and you chasing that, you pursuing that
But in-turn it cost for you to sacrifice alot of your availability to go out their and get this paper, nah mean?
It's hard to say you a man still and livin at your momma house

Yo, I had a conversation with my step-pops
Basically inquiring the time frame when I'm a pop
I told'em I ain't know but I'm determined to blow
Not like a fluffer, more like plaques that's platinum and gold
That's on my great-grandmother
He shook his head and said:
"I don't know much about the music industry but what's been said
The people ain't making no bread, let's be more realistic
How you gone take care of a wife? how you gone feed your children
I'm on my knees everyday tryna provide for ya'll
I bought that car that you dippin, but you don't chip in
You shouldve went to UCLA, like your cousin Jay
He got a big signing bonus, every year like 80k"
I looked him in the face and said "it ain't about the money
And honestly buying an education sounds funny
But have a little faith in your son, I'll come through for ya"
He said be a man Herb, that's all I really want from ya

[Hook]


You could find me in the hood poppin'
Or in the club stuntin'
There is no
Other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin'
So
I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Defy the odds when I step out the house
Pull a chick lookin' like a nigga fresh off the couch
Then I pull up in that white thing
But I don't mean it as if its something to brag about
Shit, my car's just white man
Sharp as a tack, in track to get at the club
Bottle service reserved
Go on and po' you a cup
I sip until I throw up
My hands dance in the cut
By myself I ain't lying
Attracting all of the sluts
I got a chip on my shoulder
Like there was chips in my pocket
There ain't a cent in my jeans
But you might smell the ganja
I must be living a dream man
You say I'm her dream man
So why take advantage of her
Fuck her to dreamland
[?]
Absolutely, but I love it ya'll
Still drink that cheap shit
That smells like rubbing alcohol
Still going half on a sack
Hitting pretty broads
Taking off pretty Vickys
With the matching pretty
Bras

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Give em' the chills
Rollin' on hot wheels
It ain't mine, it's the homie's
I'm just keeping it real
Say I'm phoney baloney
Even words tryna bone me
I got the hood on my back
Ain't gotta tattoo it on me
But as a matter of fact
I'mma tattoo it on me
I know you thinking I'm immaculate
That's accurate, homie
(Word Up)
Like the magazine with all of them posters
I keep a Halle Berry in the ashtray full of roaches
(To smoke up)
Pass the light
I'm finna have me a night
If your wifey's hitting the club
Before she leaves, hold her tight
Look her dead in the eye
Tell her you love her to death
And hope she don't come home with black and mild on her breath
It's Ab-Soul, the best dressed nigga in debt
Got chicks fresh outta high school, adult swimwear
(Yes)
I know I make it look simple
Like it ain't really nothing
Cause it ain't really nothing, no

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)

Keep it cool, they know I'm hot
(And I)
Do what it do, running the spot
(And I)
Don't want no problems
I'm just really tryna party
Ain't a dollar in my wallet
And nobody tryna rob me
(So I)
Keep it cool, they know I'm hot
(They know I'm hot)
Do what it do, running the spot
(Running the spot)
Don't want no problems
I'm just really tryna party
Ain't a dollar in my wallet
And nobody tryna rob me
(So I)
Tell myself its too good to be true
These niggas like, "Ab, I bet it feel good to be you"
But I'm just living my life, like T.I. and Rihanna
Making grown women melt, like ice in a sauna
And you know I got my shades on
Mackin' a model that keeps pronouncing my name wrong
I don't cuff her, but she respects my authority
So when you lookin' for a G

You could find me in the hood poppin'
All in the club stuntin'
There is no other option
And you can't tell me nothin'
The camera keeps flashin
So I'mma keep flauntin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
(And I)
I hold it down, they know what's up
The party ain't stopping
So I'mma keep frontin'
Cause what you don't know is I'm a baller on a budget
(And I)


[Hook:]
I've tried to do right
Seems as though the only way is selling my soul
It's getting hard out here
Does anybody feel me?
Cause I'm drowning in shame
Trying to maintain
Wide awake chasing my dreams
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Sometimes I gotta ask myself what do I do it for
Is it to cover up the fact I'm really insecure?
See music made it possible for me to be somebody
So if you had to say yourself
Is my intention pure?
Am I the next Shakur?
Or an intention whore?
Am I big in this prom or am I premature
Does anybody feel me or am I too far to reach
Like the edge of the world, from Redondo beach
Some say I manifest destiny when I'm on these beats
Others say I ain't flashy enough to shine
You need a chain at least
And you can be more hood
You got niggas on both sides
You acting like you ain't good
Well you from Carson right
[?] was tight
And you hot
But can you make another soul on ice
Everybody trynna tell me what I shouldn't and should
But will they still wanna [?] it up when I go 'wood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Punch]
My niggas searching for a pot o' gold
I can [?] to cool my heart to stone
Pumping cement through my veins
Taking everything for granted
Who can recognise my pain
Y'all niggas never did hear me
So I quit calling out to niggas
Let y'all deal with it, I figured
Why cast my pearls to swine
If you don't know about grapes
I couldn't tell you 'bout wine
I couldn't tell you 'bout these lines
They just hit me like rain
Without a cloud in the sky
On a summer's day
Ay, I guess it's how I was raised
Accurate knowledge, while my peers frolicked and played
My product was in some ways, disrupting my coming of age
Future looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
I'd never cover my face
I look death in the eyes, didn't blink one time
I never felt more alive than that day
But who's to say I'm different
And when I speak niggas scared they ain't listening
And that's beyond me
But I believe just four more minutes
And the truth was stranger than fiction once reality get to kicking in
It's like the modern day Noah's Ark, they took no note
Their bare heart came back and bit them no their hope floating
That's why I'm fishing through a sea of niggas
They don't hear me and I don't see 'em niggas

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
You see, it's like the Titanic scene
With the rescue boats
Slash dramatic in that
I can save y'all with quotes
I dropped the gym adrenaline accelerated my pulse
And I can say it's dope but what do I really know
Currently the word is that I'm too abstract
I can barely get my engineer to mix my tracks
I'm trynna provide you with facts
Trynna keep it real
But y'all not interested in that
You're more concerned with my appeal
You rather see me on youtube, unconcealing and still
Or on WorldstarHipHop, with diamonds in my wristwatch
Or a media take-out
Victim of a media stakeout
Cursing them out so bad
Most of my words were blanked out
I hate it when my name is mentioned with the same niggas
Who other than their DNA are the same niggas
They in the same circle, fuck the same bitches
Shake the same hands, man I'm trynna expand
For me it's gotta be to catch a flight back to Carson
I'm a need a passport for it
If you don't wanna hear me do your boy a favour
And press fast-forward, and listen to the emotion in the chorus
No this ain't a [?] outfit
But if it was I wore it
Come from a different cloth, rippin my bars
Pause
With my bare hands I can move the earth
Just cause I said it in my verse
That's the power of words
You may not ever get what I was trying to accomplish
I might not ever get to do a song with Jay
And hear him brag on Hot97 about how I'm so [?]
I'm ready to throw in the towel like laundry day
But I feel as though I've reached the point of no return
Like an expired thirty day warranty
And I deserve to be the best artist you heard
And I put that on, [?]
That's my word


[Intro:]
Yeah
Uh
One Time 4 Your Mind
Uh
Hah (Yeah)
Let's...
Drift away baby (baby)
Yes
Uh

[Verse 1:]
I seen mama make a left on main street
Had to flag her fine ass down off instinct
I'm in the Mitsubishi Mirage in dire need of a car wash indeed
She in the lil' clean Camry
I'm hoping she'll look closer than what she can see
About me, I caught her at a red light
She rolled her window down and greeted me with a smile, Sunny Delight
I'd drink a whole glass of her ass
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
That's what my conscious told me, So I said boldly:
"What's up with you and me?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and the light turned green (green, green, green)

[Hook 1:]
No my car ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

[Verse 2:]
I was tryna brush up on a honey at this kickback
Drunk throwing shots back, pretty face, ass fat (ass fat, ass fat, ass fat)
So I got behind that (behind that, behind that)
She didn't mind that
She slow whining, I'm co-signing
I said, "I hope they play Birthday Sex"
She said, "It ain't my birthday yet!"
I said, "I don't give a fuck about that"
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
And then my spoke conscious spoke free
I grabbed my Motorola Razr and said, "Lemme get your math, ma?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and pulled out her 3G
Ahhh

[Hook 2:]
No my phone ain't new!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

[Verse 3: Not In Music Video]
We had a performance at the club
I'm hype man, I figure I'd get some love
I'm off the orange juice with the Goose
Spotted a hottie on the dance floor getting loose
Approached her like, "You just my type
I had to holler before I hop on the mic"
She said, "Is that so?"
And I said, "Fo sho
I know I got shades on but I can see your glow"
I felt a connection cause baby got close
(Gotta get the number Ab, don't let your chance pass)
My conscious talked to me and laughed
So I said, "After the show you tryna come to the spot?"
(Hahahaha) She laughed to herself and said:
"You know Jay Rock? Oh..."

[Hook 3:]
No I ain't that dude!
But if you gimme your number baby
I'll get back at you
And we can drift away
We can drift away
Drift a-way baby, baby, baby
We can drift away

[Outro:]
Yeah I know Jay Rock, yeah, yeah
Yeah, we- yeah, yeah I'm his hype man
(Man?) Yeah, I'm his- you know what I'm saying though
Is you know... Uh, uh, yeah, Oh, I...
Have a good night


Guess who's back up in the mix, with my big black shades, read my big black lips
The night is still young like a nine year old kid
Finna hit the Dale's Liqour, and cop another fifth
Of Hennessy, for my personal pleasure
A took a sip, a little head dripped, so I wipe my lip
Luckily it didn't spill on my tee, I'm well-known for that
But the bitches still holla
'Till they go whores, like Kentucky Derby
The power in the Porsche, all I need is to kick back
So I can just chill like a six-pack, of coors, of course
As soon as I walk up in the door I'm yelling out

[Hook:]
Somebody spike my Sprite
So I can feel larger then life
I call this House Party 5
What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
What's popping for the night, What's popping for the night
I call this House Party 5

Yo my party don't stopping up I hit 'em up
I said wuddup, I said wuddup, he said (not much you)
You know what I'm 'bout, what's going down for the night
(Party at Ashback house), I said what
He said (yup), shit y'all be fucked up
Stepping out, like an accident, roof level
Outta elevator in a skyscraper in the clouds
I hung up, ran to the bathroom to clean my Air One's up
I would rock the Timb boots but they all scuffed up
I looked in the mirror, seen my swag was up
Don't play swag out, so I had to adjust
Fast forward, I seen so many cars pulling up
Hoes pulling down they skirts, niggas with
"We can't lose" on they shirts, you would assume they take it to the dirt
Some of my niggas real killers, put you down to Earth
And they down to Earth, and we Chris Rock
The party like it don't stopping up

[Hook]

And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, and the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up
Now put your hands up in the air
If you tryna put it in the air
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got homies 2 stepping to the right of me
We got Hennessy, got Nuvo to spare
If you trying to go, we can take you there
Got bitches shaking ass to the left of me
Got the homies 2 stepping to the right of me

Yeah, another round on me
Look at this women move her booty around on me
It's 2:15 in the morning but we up
Finna hit the Dennies, tell 'em hook a scrambled up
Pissy drunk if you didn't know my nigga, no my nigga
Higher then a spirits, of the un-living
In the mist of everybody fucking up the homies house
Think B.I.'s party and bullshit, a fight broke out

[Hook]

And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Don't stopping up, don't stopping up
Yeah, And the party don't stopping up
It don't stopping up, it don't stopping up


Uh, Soul Brother Number...
Rapper! Ha, Whats Good Big Homie
Ya Know I Got That Flava

(Good Evening Ladies & Gentleman
This evening takes great pride in presenting)

Uh, Soul brother number 2
Here to take number 2 on any number 2
That's who's ever after me
Don't get my spot confused
Like a gang of dalmatians in the same room
I never sleep; you snooze, you lose
I'm on a consecutive leap
Slick wit it, sippin' a 40, No WD
Splendid, ended my name on your brain
Like a paragraphs first sentence..(MANE!)
Please see the passion in this young man
Burn this bitch down even if I got one fan
Like, You hear this, you ears will sun tan
I'm an army tank, you're just one man
And niggas talkin' bout they label offers
Knowin' damn well them labels off ya
You know you got it all wrong
When you start equating your success with Drake and Trey Songz
Soul

[Hook:]
Where you need to be?
Where you need to go?
What you need to see? lemme know
(Baby I Can show You...show You)
We only got one life
Live it to the T
But, Take It From Me
(Don't let time control you..trol' You)

Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?

I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like

Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?
Whatchu Livin' Like?

I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like
I'm livn' like

[Rapper Big Pooh:]
I say I'm livin' like the world can't hold me
Mama can't scold me, like a lawn chair niggas fold me
Flow sounding moldy & dated
Rap game I hate it
But at the same time I'm in love deeply
I'm in love indiscreetly, stop looking for them neat raps
Go ahead get ya wet naps
Chicago poetic justice with my wave cap
I know some people mad at me cause I ain't wave back
Double Impact; No Jean Claude
Niggas got stories but most of them fraud
We are all flawwed
Only difference is I display mine
If I say your music whack, that's a hate crime
You can debate I'm better than the next one
Each fan text one, I could a have million
Me and Ab building, Me and Ab killing
I wish you would fight the feeling

[Hook]

King of my stomping ground
I don't fuck around, like a Tupperware top I shut shit down
I wear the underwear here, it's best you know now
When Queers interfere I can feel it in the air
They ain't gotta make a sound
Ain't shit sweet
But the swisher full of weed where my thumb and my index meet
You don't quite cut the criteria
We keep trees on us like LRG, Cause
Mass hysteria walkin' across the street, cause
They never seen a nigga so concrete
And You can understand that right?
You look a little dumbfounded
Believe whatever you looking for I done found it
I can show you the real and I can tell you the grind
But even T-Pain get this shit overnight
And If, nothing else remember this
The smartest man in the world know we don't know shit

Tommy Black, Wassup
Tommy Black, Wassup
Soul Brother Number...


[Verse 1:]
You mighta caught me walkin on annalee
On my way to work, I ain't no jerk, you can wave at me
Faithfully I strafe from all the make-believe, pray for me
This the shit they make-up make me think maybe it's maybelline
They will not disable me, even Kane afraid of me
Now niggas wanna network like A&E
City on my back like a superman cape would be
Ab-soul, asshole, why you act an ass for?
You ain't even got your own pad you a tadpole
It's a future ahead of you, why you looking back though
Frontin like you in the front when you in the last row
Microphone check 1, 2 are you hearin this
Curtiss king will tell you I'm a lyricist, lyricist
Been a trip before I caught a flight, alright?
Why you think I'm always smiling, I'm nice
Rapper's delight, that titles suffice
I don't even think you existed but my idol is christ
I too have a passion for what I feel is right
That's why I get high as a Wright brother and write

[Hook:]
Cause I just need'em to remember me
Before I'm dead and gone write my name in history
Mentally, I'm meant to be, infinite, energy
Martin Luther King of carson, peace to my enemies
And cause this is Long Term 2
And every one of my dreams will all come true
This a journey we all go through
And if you can't cut it then it's all on you

[Verse 2:]
I had to be about two
All I remember was Charlie Brown and Dr. Seuss
Momma read me a bed-time story every night
Comprehended so well I thought it was all true
That's all truth, 20 years later
I became a wordsmith like a kid from will and jada
Took a fifth of henny to the head and thought ahead
Why they worrying bout my buzz, I ain't a insect
What the fuck, ya'll got me fucked up
(What the fuck, ya'll got me fucked up)
Don't get a nigga mis-conscrewed
Cause I get loaded like a brand new pistol, ahhh shoot
Long as you knew that I'm on the pursuit
Of greatness 'til I lay in a tomb, I'm raiding
The game is weak, knowing it's painful and not short
However long it take just know I'm not going

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
(Heaven ain't far Soul)
Yea, I swear to God I wrote this on annalee
On my way to work, I'm late, I know my momma mad at me
(PEACE) to all the homies formerly know as casualties
Prosect, I miss you man I do this shit for you
I revise my timelines see how I do
2000 I was cool, '01 I had fun
'02 I recorded my first song and I was sprung
'03 I was weak, '04 I had flow
'05 I signed a street beef with no dough
'06 I met punchline, Damn I thank punchline
He saw more in my music than metaphors and punchline
'07 DudeDawg told me I was family
In '08 you became a fan of me
'09 I went around the country in a rock band
Now it's twenty-ten ya'll, get a catscan dawg

[Hook]


[Intro:]
This shit right here is like... Heh
This, this shit right here is like the calm before the storm
Like little kids playing in Japan before Hiroshima got bombed on
Yo

[Verse 1:]
I'm sick of holding back, Jay told me go harder
How else am I gonna prove I'm the number one author?
Sometimes I wake up in the morning mourning for my father
And the more I think about it - the more I get stronger
It didn't kill me, it contributed to the growth
I take five dollars - contribute it to the smoke
I rather get high while I'm living at the bottom
But even when I ride you gon' see my red eyes
Like the last flight to the night
See I done soared through the air like fighting a knight
I've seen bad times and I cherish the good
My sentences give life, man, fly me a kite if you would
I'm so introspective
All it took was a pen and a little reflection
But what does it to take to be number one?
Will one of you motherfuckers please answer the question
I'm starving out here, and I haven't prayed to God in so long
He'll probably try to charge me for a blessing, am I wrong?

[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all

[Verse 2:]
I never gave up, niggas want me to raise up
But I'm a kick it 'till my fucking flower bed's made up
Tear a fucking stage up every time we hit a venue
Eating all rappers - Vibe magazine is like a menu
Shall I continue? You said yes didn't you?
Seven star general, all for being liberal
Cause how is it that what I'm saying give you a visual?
I promise all competition candlelight rituals
Quite the individual, deliver the mayhem!
Like swine born in the springtime, I'm borderline psycho
When I come up with lines to bite your
Fucking face off, ya'll ain't trying to face off!
Ab-soul, divine with the rhymes
Bring sight to the deaf and sound to the blind
Ya'll do it for the light intertwined with lime
I do it cause on the mic ain't none of ya'll better
TopDawg, ya'll mice, taking all of ya'll chedddar
Am I right?
Fucking right, yeah

[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all

[Verse 3:]
Cause 2010 I'm trying to ball nigga
Like shooting jump shots in the mall nigga
Cause my skies are gray
You could say I'm a goose in a pond of some hard liquor
I tend to go overboard with the metaphors
Still walking in the shadow of my team
Jay Rock finna blow - 2010 fo sho
And K-Dot and C4, but what about me?
It's kind of hard to say you top notch
Parking your bucket in front of your mom's spot
Still getting dime bags on credit
Girl wanna go out, all you can afford is iHop
It's fucked up right? That's where I'm at with it
I'm finna crack like a egg hat, stand back

[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all

[Verse 4:]
And in the midst of the bullshit
I'm still nothing to fool with
The type of nigga bitches wanna get cool with
Primarily cause of my future in music
They seen me shake Nipsey Hussle's hand
I hear them whisper to themselves, "he's the fucking man"
I do one song with Glasses
And I'm the talk in all the high school classes
In the studio with Game
Just soaking up game like I'm standing in the rain
So when I'm in the booth (MAYDAY)
Better yet I'm finna make it my new AKA
Yea, Willie B what up?
Shit's hot sorta like a temperature nigga, keep it up
Uh, and please turn your speakers up
Cause Eric Wright couldn't make it look easier
Rest in peace my nigga
But since you've been gone I've been killing these niggas

[Hook:]
Hold on, Mayday
Ab-Soul you driving them crazy
Ah ha, Fooled you
No matter how heavy the situation we pull through
Yeah, yeah I do it for the love
I do it for ya'll
I do it cause I'm the one
That's it, that's all


And grab a glass and move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Yeah, yeah move your hips
Go ahead, move your hips

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
And do what I wanna do to her
And she would never tell me "No"
She would tell me go far as I want to go
Anything I need just let her know
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (moe)
She would even catch a tiger by the toe
Just to put a smile on the face of Ab-Soul
And that's so amazing
That I know...

[Chorus:]
She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
My dream girl...

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
That'd be nice (That'd be nice)
Because she let me take full control
She don't ask no question she just rolls
With the punches and she hold no hunches
I can't wait 'til I doze off
So we can pick up where we left off
(All-I-Need-Is-Her)
That's all...

[Chorus]

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
Maybe I should fall asleep (fall asleep)
She said "What took you so long?"
"I was starting to think you'd moved on."
I told her "I was busy writing a song."
She said "Bout what?"
I said "Bout you."
She said "Don't lie."
I said "Baby, it's true."
She said "So what, let's do what it do."

She is the one that I've been waiting for
All day I wish I could be with her more
Wish I could physically feel her for real
My dream girl...

Grab a glass and move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Just move your hips
Grab somebody and move your hips
Grab a glass and move your hips
Just move your hips
Do it like this
Like this ma, left to the right
Left to the right, I said
Like this, left to the right
I mean left to the right
Boom...boom
It fade out...
Cut...
Did I get it though?


Blue Chucks with my Locs on
Hoping that the blood homies don't take it wrong
And wipe me off the face of this earth
And for the record, I am not banging the turf
I ain't got no record, I ain't never laid a nigga to dirt
And other than a nine to five I never had no work
But that don't mean shit, I could still get murked
Any given Sunday, in front of a church, chuch
Tabernacle, chapel, if I ain't on the block I'm somewhere behind an apple
Bottom model blotto, poppin' Old English like senior citizens speaking
And me and legend blowing big kush
In a little coupe the same size big foot's foot,
And now niggas looking up to me
And I ain't even tall, It's hard to be.

Under the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off

See, The Pressure ret everywhere were
And if it bust a pipe, it can take your life
Right before your eyes, and your homie's too
You had to run it cause the color of your tennis shoes
And I hope you got a spare pair
And a fresh pack of newports to calm your nerves,
Roll up the herb, that's my first name
And I get high until I die, that's on my Daddy's grave
You niggas wearin' a mask
Trying to masquerade away from the facts, of your past
In past tense I pass this like classes, a took a Curtis magnet
I remember one time, one of the homies had a black burner in a black jacket
Shit, who predicted he'd get hit before twenty one
Black Jacket is, trying to count your cards quicker than us
I'm air tight never flinch when the

Under the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off

[Jay Rock:]
When the pressure was on
Niggas talk loud but they break wild, when the weapons are drawn
I should hit ten in his dome, cause he a snitch he don't represent this gangster shit
Shit, he don't know it feel to see your homie's cap peeled by the black steel, for real
I can still see the blood spill its ill its ugly nasty
Uh, still keep the cannon in the back seat
What, puffin' the blunt, fully trucked
For any nigga that wanna lay in the dust in the ford trucks
Trust, I ain't with the B.S., I'm out the E.S.,
With a bad bitch
Pro Club 1x tall, no V-neck
Show me where the cheese at, I ain't talkin' Cheese-Its
Use to serve rocks out the block, Al Paci-ess
Now I crush mics on the song
Life's a gamble plus a nigga never fold when the

Under the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off
I said the pressures off


[Intro:]
You came in and flicked it
You was flicking it you know what I'm saying
(On fire, on fire, on fire)

I'm trying man...

[Verse 1:]
Bitch I'm high as a motherfucking satellite, who got a light?
I'm outta sight, outta mind pimp, matching dimes
Don magic wands, roll the greenery
It's what I need: where my shin and thigh meet
Huh, yeah I'm such a fucking stoner
Everywhere I dwell you can smell the marijuana odor
What the hell? (What the hell?) That's that fire, man
Call the fireman, or the supplier man, tell him slide a gram
(Solo, solo, solo) You know we smoking that dower
Two titans back to back call em Twin Towers
(Haa, Haa) And anytime I'm on the ground
I stop, drop, and roll... then burn it down!
If that's exactly what you're doing right now
Put your lighters up, and wave them round and round
Puff, puff, give: real shit
I'll probably run through seven pounds, Will Smith

[Hook:]
Pass the blunt, Pass the blunt
Man you tryna smoke or what?
Four deep in the Hooptie finna roll the windows up
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
White paper [?]
That was dutch and swishers, even Philly's filling up

Smoke something bitch [x8]

[Verse 2:]
Black Hippy, sticky in the piece pipe
No I'm no [?] but I'm throwing up the peace sign
Smoke fill the room every time a nigga inside
And when I'm off this I feel like the H.N.I
See no seeds in my product that's a no-no
I'm three dollars short and I'm a need it for the lolo
I owe the weed man down the street, also:
I got the munchies and I haven't ate, Ocho
(Fuego, fuego, fuego) Ab-Solo
I hit the blunt then pass it the horseman on my polo
Daddy Fat Sacks (Smoke something bitch!)
I mean till that motherfucker burn your fingertips
Watch your lip, concentrate
Let's see how much more you can take
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)
And when your bitch call tripping, pimp man this is what you say:
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)

[Hook:]
Pass the blunt, Pass the blunt
Man you tryna smoke or what?
Four deep in the Hooptie finna roll the windows up
Pass the blunt, pass the blunt
White paper [?]
That was dutch and swishers, even Philly's filling up

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Got something in that optimal swisher got me feeling right
I'm feeling like, Transformer forming in the highest height (Yesss)
Michael Thriller night, moonwalk in flight (yea, yea)
Heaven or hell, I be good in paradise (uh, uh)
I give you satellite (uh huh)
Or some other shit, Prada Louie printed shits
Getting money growing off the tree, Dough dough
You never smoke but always want the trees, Popo!
And that's a no-no, I get your son
I take his lung, I let you keep the photo
The swisher burning keep me earning everything in slow-mo
[?], kick it like a dojo
Wake and bake, elevate
Let's see how much more you can take
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)
And if this month I earn a thou then fuck it I'll buy a vowel
(I'm blowing O's, I'm blowing O's)

Smoke something bitch [x8]

[Outro:]
Soul (soul, soul, soul, soul, soul)
(Hahaha) Lil round, tripping


[Verse 1:]
Game keep changing, Tats on faces
Look close, you can see how rats run races
You find it's all about the cheese at the other end
They forgot the simple shit, like strengthening your limbs
I listen to the radio and I begin to cringe
I eat MCs, find a spot inside my fridge
When y'all was tricking off, taking bitches to the bridge
I was sparking up a cig, tryna tighten up this bridge
The hook is real catchy and the verse is interesting
Now all I need is a feature from Drake or Lil Wayne
I never move hoes, like say a Gucci Mane
I'm broke as a bitch, and I spit like I'm insane
But what a nigga gotta do to shock the whole nation
Sign to ROC nation, become a fucking Mason
Monopolize, prophesize an abomination
I'll Do it, but you thought it was just music?

[Hook:]
Passion
What the fuck happened
Somebody talk to him
Motherfuck rapping
(Oooooh, where's your passion)

[Verse 2:]
This for my niggas that log on to All HipHop
And listen to niggas they never heard cause they love Hip Hop
I got so much drive I never need a pit stop
It's scarier than a whole hour of Alfred Hitchcock
I'll probably make your bottom lip drop when my shit drop
I'm in tip top condition
With a hustler's ambition
Ounce after ounce, me and Jizzle keep twisting
Until we get twisted like the caps on snitches
Just know our little passion will take you a long way
Like Pussy & Patron can salvage a long day
I dive head first in a verse and swim away
And pull a pen out and throw a grenade at your brigade
Like a Skin Head, you're a barber that can't fade
I'm up all night trying to come up with something crazy
So while you sleeping like a baby
I'm a seal up the deal, no relation to the navy

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Uhn
I wake up in the morning and compose a rhyme doper than the last time before I even opened my eyes
Open-minded to the truth, but not naive to what is fiction
I probably love this more than my bitch, say I'm trippin'
Leave your ass in a ditch, if you can dig it
You mad cause I found my niche and you didn't
Too fucking bad
Fuck with Ab
And so you know, every sentence, it is from the Soul

[Alori Joh Sings]

[Ab-Soul randomly talks]


"This Northwood, this is where I slumber at. You know what I'm saying?"

I got my mind on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush... Rush

I was on Avalon, in a Avalon
With the window down, two notche for TV on
Yeah, thatâs what he be on
California sunshine, heater on
I laid the text but sometimes niggas read it wrong
Still a slave to the page, no beeper on
If the sky tell lies then let me lie (where?)
In the same home that the reaper own
Fire, feel the degrees rising in this song
Keep the degree pollutin' your speakers till Iâm gone
Became a tree, mama your seed is growin'
Niggas see me, see where Iâm going
Uphill, and I keep going
Through the red lights, through the roadblocks
My headlights blind the opposition
Ainât got 200 on the dash but Iâm doing half

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
Iâm always in a rush

Rolling down central, in a bucket but Iâm feeling presidential
Breaking down swishaâs, filling 'em with indo
Hoâs trying to date a nigga like info's
Iâm flying right by 'em like holla back
Hoping they wonât see me through the tinted windows
Bending corners like I ainât got a bookmark
Ainât got the most paper but Iâm booksmart
Iâm speeding through life like fuck it all (My nigga)
I got my word and my fuckings balls (My nigga)
And thatâs my word Iâm a fucking ball (My nigga)
Control the earth so I can have a ball (My nigga)
Iâm moving at a fast pace and I ainât slowing up for Nathan
Paparazzi follow me but they canât keep up the tape
You ainât talking longterm and you ainât talking my language
Donât trip, we still popping like a stainless
Fo' real

When I roll through the city it gives me a rush, rush
Swear to god it makes my adrenaline rush, rush, rush, rush, rush
So when you see me in the street Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a (yeaaah) rush, rush, rush
Iâm always in a rush, rush, rush, rush, rush (yeaaah)
So when you see me in the street
Iâm always in a rush

Del Amo, Del Amo
Eyes on the prize, wheels on the roll
Eyes to the skies, bless my soul
Rush.... Rush


Do it sound tight?

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Considered a fuck up all of my life
Too smart for my own good all of the time
In kindergarten I got a kick out of pissin' on my classmates
And I recall getting ass whoopings every couple days
I had a Power Ranger bike I wheelied in the street
Got grounded for a month for spray painting it green
I went to middle school and started slacking in my studies
Before the they rise and aimed the gang bangers were my buddies
I wasn't fit for it I needed a tailor
I still went for it
It wasn't out of anger
I needed to be accepted in my neighborhood
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion

I ain't shit
I must be constipating
Cause I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

[Hook:]
Things ain't always what they seem
If you look close you can see
What's your perception of me?
Is it good? I wish it was

Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
In ninth grade I started off on the right track
Got a few A's but then I bounced right back
Wasn't aware my main thought was what I should wear
Now that I think about it nobody really cared
I grew up in the church but barely paid attention
Read up on Malcom X and started questioning religion
Became a rebel
I still believe in God
I just doubt the authenticity of Jesus and the Devil
I got my first car and started smoking black and milds
The smell is like a bell and Hades, hella loud
Then it was Newports and Kools on my way to school
My girl hated it but still kissed me in the mouth
I started ditching class more than I attended
I was walking a path that I had not intended
It looked as though I was mad, becoming relentless
My mamma couldn't tell me nothing
End of discussion

I ain't shit
I ain't attracting no flies man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

[Hook:]
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I got kicked out, crept back in
If I wasn't fucking I was fussing with my step-dad again
Oh yeah I rapped, didn't take it that serious
But I flowed like an ocean among my peers
Dreams of going off to college in my younger years
Then the whole thought of it sounded nuts I had dumbo ears
Did about a semester then I was outta there
Said if I get one song on radio, I'm outta here
Knowing that low ratio of successful entertainers
I chose to go at people with skulls, but they was brainless
Started smoking weed as soon as purple kush was famous
Shifting my setting eventually as I went through changes
People I seen my whole life appeared to me as strangers
Created a voice through my music and now they speak my language
I was in Jay Rock video for less than 15 seconds
All of a sudden niggas that I looked up to see me as a legend
Now I step in clubs and some bitches give me hugs
But back in P.E. tennis a nigga got zero love
I'm just a hard headed loser
My mamma was trying to save me from stalling out my future

Cause I ain't shit
I don't need no toilet paper man I ain't shit
Naw, I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit

[Hook:]
Cause I ain't shit
You may think I'm eating
But I ain't shit
Naw I ain't shit, I ain't shit, I ain't shit


Longterm is defined as...Fuck it y'all already know

Chyeaa, the long awaited, highly anticipated (L-T-2)
Haha it's human music; nothing more, nothing less
You know what type of nigga I am, I just borrowed a dollar from the homie
I'm back...I know you missed me

Long Term the sequel, my swisher sweet is equal
My cup is full of brown like the skin color of Hebrews,
And this is not a test, no I'm nothing to mess
With, just find a cliff, and please don't watch your step
You know just what I rep, Top notch to the fullest
And TDE's my fam, for each of them I catch a bullet.
I'm strolling on Del-Amo Boulevard towards the Arco
To get another Black & Mild, my lungs look like charcoal, Yea I know-
Your whip is like one of those in car shows, I still got '09 tags on my Mitsubishi mirage
No gas, need new break pads, new tires to inspire to get money like Arabs.
Jewish lawyers, NASDAQ stock holders
But for now I'm broke, I need a fix, I be borrowin' the homie's clothes to go to events
Just so I'm camera ready when they be takin' flicks, I admit

[Hook:]
I'm still a regular nigga, doin' regular shit
Got my regular car, got my regular bitch
Still dressin' the part, in my regular fit
Like being regular is some irregular shit
I ain't changed for shit (no)
Still walking 'round with a pocket full of motherfuckin' change
(I'm on my regular shit!)
Homie! [x4]

No chain, no watch
No diamonds, no Glock
No rap sheet, no new drop whip, no top
No Gucci, no Louis, no shopping on Melrose
I asked for the bitch number, she looking like "Hell naw"
No record, no street credit, I'm probably in debt
No work, Herb never move right off his step
No G-4s, no clearports, none of that
I got a standby ticket
As for the flight, I just missed it
I'm trying to stay optimistic
In the midst of the struggle
Cause y'all make it rain, but I just slipped in a puddle
See my life is simple: I rap and smoke weed
Eat when I can, have sex when I need
Grab a fifth of E-
And J and I'm straight
I don't meant to be vane but hey I must be the savior
And if you're playing this tape, you're playing it safe
But I'm getting escorted by the armed forces to home plate (Soul!)
I am only the antonym of fake, if you're antenna is up, then you may feel the same
I see your 24's and them motherfuckers great
I even like the green and red stiches on your J's
The LV on your belt buckle, Audemar arm
Purple label, VIP table, Chandon
Black car, model braud always on the scene
5 Star continental breakfast, presidential suite
But to be the best, do I gotta have those things?
Is that the only way that I'mma make these hoes sing?
Make these niggas feel me and put on my whole team
Shit, that'll compromise my own dreams
A fortune cookie read; I had a future in music
I wonder how many people got that very same message
An A&R told me that I look like a star
And before I let it get to my head, it's best I confess it

[Hook]

[JaVonte:]
Just doing what I do
Just doing what I do
Just doing what I do
[Ab-Soul:]
And this is Long Term 2 nigga
(I'm doing what I do) Lifestyles of the broke and almost famous
(Just doing what I do)


Uhh, whattup Brown? Whattup Blue?
Yeah, look

Thou-thought it was love, not just a mockery of
We been close since snot noses
That's some old shit, yeah no shit
You chose your path. Me? I was focused on this rapping
You was trapping and I wasn't mad
You was nickel and diming, all the while
I was getting pennies for rhyming
You was eating at Tony Roma's, I had only Top Ramen
I can smell the aroma when you pass
It ain't only the potent doja you just passed
Cause now you tryna go legit, and pick up a mic
All cause you heard So Far Gone and that shit sound tight
You see me buzzing in the streets so you figure a feature
(Should) give your name a boost like the prepaid cell phone would
I lay my verse and the verdict was:
Homie got off, but Herb murdered Cuz
And instead of studying my tactics
You turned dyslexic and now you're looking at me backwards
That's straight madness, we were compadres
And now this, what can I say?
Guess that's what happens when your stick pass the shorter end
The strongest niggas start to bend

[Chorus:]
I thought it was love
I thought it was real
I thought you were being sincere
I thought you'd forever be here, yeah
I thought it was love
I thought it was love
I thought it was real, yeah

[Brown:]
She knew his track records
Took a chance on his past
Cause he was sure to
Make her laugh when she was sad
Enjoy the company, especially when her legs were spread
He was a guilty pleasure
Loved it when they were together
But nothing lasts forever
Been talking for a minute
Feelings start to develop, at first there wasn't any
She's entitled to a title but he isn't ready
For commitment, not yet
A year and a half passed in the relationship
But finding messages in his phone from miscellaneous chicks
Lies on top of lies
She was blind, didn't realize
Notice that ignorance is bliss
She put too much time and effort off into him
For it to end up like this
So she forgives what he did
But she doesn't forget
Everything that he puts her through
Through it all, she don't want it to end
Started out as a visit
He was merely a friend
Now her heart was his home
Where she felt he belonged
Was scared of being alone
Held those emotions within
She went through his phone
And she caught him again
She said

[Chorus]


Yeah, come come now
Soul brother number two, I'm the one now
Sun up to sun down, still kickin' that shit
Put your gun down
I come in peace like a extraterrestrial being
Eat me a meteor and walk across the moon barefeet
But don't nobody rhyme like this no more
Call me the 2010 Rakim
I got soul, there's more in store
Feel like a CVS, open 24
Spent nights tryin' to overshadow my shadow
For niggas tryin' to block my light like a solar eclipse
I bring a knife to a fist fight and when I cut a record
So when I cut the cheese, shit you know what it is
Mr. Absoulutely the most incredible at this
So adjust your bass, your treble and then

[Hook:]
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Yo, turn me up some
Turn me up some, turn me up some
[x2]

Finna break this blunt down and burn me up one
Then sip on this Remy 'til it turn me up some
For me it's more difficult to be simple than it is to be complex
As a lot of apartments
You niggas comedy, I'm laughing at you probably
We are not the same, there's no strand of monotony
Between you and I until we die
Revelations say you either fry or fly
And it's hard to find God when you ain't never seen Him
It's pie in the sky and there's bodies on the cement
And I know you lookin' at me like, "You don't speak English"
I bring the heat like a phoenix, a son under Phoenix sun
And I'm rootin' for the Lakers when they play the Phoenix Suns
I ain't really into sports, that's just where I'm from
Long Term Two
And if it's in your possession then follow the directions my dude

[Hook]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Come come now
Pac told me fuck the world, I'm 'bout to cum now
I've been a pro, but now I'm profound
Propane on posers, restraining from the doja
Imagine if I smoke, I probably come up with a quote
So heavy you'll forget every album you heard from Hova
Or 2pacalypse I'm Hub City's novelist
Come and get your scholarship, I'm taking kids to school
A pool full of spit, dive in, I'm 'bout to drool
You'll drown trynna backstroke on concepts that I wrote
I was a black sheep, but now I'm just a goat
And I'm 'bout to elope, married to the game joe
This is hip hop at its finest, where'd you find this? In a Ziploc
Til the wheels fall off, fuck a pit-stop or what not
Where my tear drop? I murdered it
My pot-holes is turbulence
I'm in the sky wit it
When you listening to Kendrick, just

[Hook]

This for my niggas that really rap all night
No sleep, do it with your eyes closed
I can see your vision from Del-Amo
Poppa took the television, but left the radio
Ill niggas, wack niggas, what's the ratio?
Is this shit degrading or inspirational?
I'll have you know I must've wrote about a thousand rhymes, a thousand times
I give you my word

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Cause I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
I just gotta be heard
Said I gotta be, yes sir I gotta be
Heard, heard, heard, heard

[Hook]


[Beat The Case]

[Ab-Soul:]
Doeburger!
Head swingin' like Rambo, he be spittin' like he pullin' triggers
Make a enemigo an example
(And I bet I beat the case)
Lot of guys with the gavels, look em' right up in they face
While a nigga under oath, plead the fifth, then ask if I can smoke
Burnin' dirty money but I keep a little something for the clean escape
And the rainy day after
Don't forget a nigga live where the heat wave at ya
And ya safe ain't safe
And heat don't wave back but life is cold that way
Ay man

All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Got my chopper went to [?] bullets flying out the case
Only witnesses are gay, nothing sneaking on the tape
All I do is get the.. uh, yeah
Shoot you grabbin' in the bag
Shit you makin' it ain't half, of what I made up in the past
Groovy Tony with the moves, uh
My bank account done ate a moose, uh
Why the car ain't got a roof, uh
Crib still ain't got a boost, uh
Black hippy with the caps lock, when my album came..
Best album out in hiphop and I'm still heatin' up the crockpot
Platinum plaques that I ain't hung yet
You got opinions no achievements
Type of niggas make me laugh, uh
Hit the gas and turn to flash, uh
Palms itching like a rash, uh
My trigger finger be the stash, uh
Bitch I'm blankin' out the face, uh
(All I do is beat the case)

[Ab-Soul:]
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case

Let me set the record straight
You got 10 commandments, 33 amendments over 20,000 laws
Raise your hand if you think you'll beat the case
Motherfuck a Bill of Rights
I need a bill of Miller's Lite
Phenergan up in my sprite
I ain't sippin' Miller Lite
I like to say my lighter white
Lit the spliff and went to space
Then I'm playin' with the white
What an interracial day
I made her write a different light
Got gerped up by the jakes
Had the work tucked, guns in the truck
Licenses suspended, but remember...

All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat it, beat it, beat it
Like a runaway slave
Get your king popped, MJ, I'm dangerous, keep away
The doctors say what an odd autopsy
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
All I do is beat the case
I ain't never go to jail
I ain't never gon' tell
All I do is beat the case
[x2]

[Straight Crooked]

Ruffled up a couple feathers when I called Barack a puppet show
Now that Trump is POTUS I know this election is just another Muppet Show
That ain't even none of my business though
Whatever's your cup of tea
Even lil' Niemah voted for Hillary
I'm a entity, never mind my identity
My king Slim hit me with a quote that sticked with me
A criminal's best asset is his liability
(That was crazy, lie-ability)
Do What Thou Wilt nigga (Soul!)
Cause these niggas a have you swim across a ocean just to drown you in a lake
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Word, word yea
Make sure I was straight
I had to be a little crooked just to make sure I was straight
Don't [?]
The righteous will remain righteous and the filthy will remain filthy
In a sense, we all guilty


[Ab-Soul:]
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

(Turn it up a lil more, uh, uh, yeah)
Soulo Ho the prophet
I'm a fiend like Bassy
Money like I'm Saudi, agua from the islands
We went from Pintos to Benzos
Plain and simple, let's race a little
The bar needs to be raised a little
I led the way, but never raised the pencil
Might pay your rent if you suck good dick
And you know what our time apart meant
Pardon me, if I'm arguably
The hardest nigga on the beat
Me and Bas is bosses, throwin' their boxers
I can own fifty dollar boxers
I just wanna spend hunnid stacks everyday
I went digital
Yo shit we don't dig at all, we just dish if off
You know I gotta eat
My bitch got cakes and I'm getting that brain
That's food for thought
Uhh, got the loud and it's lit
Got the loud and it's lit
You smoking that reggie, you niggas ain't ready
Be quiet and quit

Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

[Bas:]
Bassy on a mission
Stackin' dough like it's a photo moment
Haters hate us only for the moment
'Cause your bitch wanna take a photo, homie
Soulo rollin', got an onion on us
Where my city dolo like Vanilla Sky
Smoking like we 'bout to cross the border
Got a couple shows up on the other side
25 in a row, shit
Shows jumping we've been hittin' licks
Money flowin' like we flippin' bricks
Now I don't know if I've ever been in this town
Flip a switch, killing niggas like I pulled the plug
Quarter pound of piff to fill the lungs
Got the whole crowd yelling, "Feel the buzz," it's lit
I call her, one DM
I land around noon, but I fuck by 1PM, FIENDS
Practice what you preach, preach love
Careful what you eat, half of it's diseased
They don't want us here

[Ab-Soul:]
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say
Everythin' been did, each and every which way
You ain't never seen it done like this, you ain't never
You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this
Try say somethin' new, it ain't nothin' new to say

You ain't never, you ain't never seen it done like this

What the tongue can't taste
What the eyes can't see
What the ear can't hear
What your nose can't sniff
Put your hands in the air
P-put your hands in the air
What the tongue can't taste
What the eyes can't see
What the ear can't hear
What your nose can't sniff
P-put your hands in the air
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

Peter Piper picked the pack of pickled peppers
Soulo found a pound of loud and lit it up
Bet this resin never leave my finger tips
Helen Keller would've felt the shit
But tell me what is it you niggas wan't
Really, tell me what is it you niggas wan't
Are you niggas dope or you just doin' dope?
Is you niggas dope or you just doin' dope?


[Ab-Soul & Mac Miller:]
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I say I love my mama, Lord knows I does
I love my family, my cousins, that's my blood
I love this music, it come from up above
I love my niggas and I love my bitches
I love everybody that's listenin'
If you rich or poor, so what?
The whole world we livin' in
Everything that's livin' in it
Trees down to the bugs
Can't forget about my plug
'Cause last but not least I love drugs
I love drugs
I can't help myself, I think I need some help
I can't help myself, I think I need some help

[Ab-Soul:]
They say the apple don't fall far from the tree
Apple a day, it keep the doctors away
I wonder if my father got more faded than me
But I can't ask him, 'cause the doctors couldn't save him, baby
My mama clean as holy water, hallelujah
We total opposites, I'm dirty as this Fanta mix
We Qualitesters, we can't find no Hi-Tech, I ain't lyin', nigga
Act stashed on the low for the high, nigga
Whole squad full of them codeine fiends
OG by the OZ, and I still owe the weed man down the street
Monster magic off them Xannies, I might have me one
Mix it with the syrup, Perc' on top of that
Then I'll be numb, if I don't wake up, tell 'emâ¦

I love my mama, Lord knows I does
I love my family, my cousins, that's my blood
I love this music, it come from up above
I love my niggas and I love my bitches
I love everybody that's listenin'
If you rich or poor, so what?
I love the whole world we livin' in
And everything that's livin' in it
From the trees down to the bugs
Can't forget about my plug
'Cause last but not least I love drugs
Last but not least I love drugs
(Purple still comin' in)

Molly got me rollin', got me rollin', nigga
I got the sniffles, need a box of tissues (Blow it!)
I got some issues, I ain't talkin' about a newspaper
Talkin' about the issues that come with this new paper
My new bitch in the next room in the nude, nigga
Broad day, blinds openâsee the view, nigga?
Cornea, so scarred can't look myself up in the eyes
But if I could I would say: "Who is you, nigga?!"
What's become of Herb III's son?
Wasn't for these abortions I'd probably be on my third son
That was they decision, for the record
Just clearin' my conscience
That don't make it better, nigga
You know I know better, nigga

[Ab-Soul & Mac Miller:]
I love my mama, Lord knows I does

You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
Think I need some help
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh, so fresh, no
I think I need some help
Junky so fresh
You ain't never seen a junky so fresh, so fresh, no
I think I need some help
I love my mama

You ain't never seen a junky
Lords knows I does
I think I need some help, I need some help
I love my mama
I need some help, I need some help
Lord knows I does
Can you go find me some help?

(That's what I'm sayin'. That's why you don't need a Xan, cuz. I said time flies... Didn't you hear what I said? I said time flies. Time flies, love fades... Goddamn, man!)

[Ab-Soul:]
Married to marijuana, addicted to cigarettes
Codeine's my concubine, cocaine confidant
Adderall Admiral, absolutely, give Danny credit
Perc' 30 flow, exactly how Saudi said it
Season pass to Xanny land, Hennessy in my piss
Can't forget I'm psychic off them psychedelics
And for the kids lookin' up to me for what I've seen
No, I don't need any of these things to do anything
Soul

All my brethren, I pray for your mercy
And that you alleviate my pain
You that dwell in the glory of God
Listen to the sufferance of this
Your humble servant
Grant me health, well-being, and happiness
Amen


That's just a snare; don't be afraid of the snare

I'm an evil genius, disobedient, villain you hate to love
Mischievous, mysterious, miscellaneous
Used to make love to complex simplicity all the time
Now she my star and I'm her sky and I ain't afraid to die
I don't give a fuck!
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)

Indecisive, enlightening, frightening idol with the light
Sensitive Eye of the Tiger, fire flame
Dylan times 5 by the way
Skydiving tidal waves
Writing rhymes and oxygen
Scribing sonnets silently
That inspire men and brightening environments
That I have not been in
Obviously opting not to sing songs in sobriety
Subsiding the poison imploding our society
Functioning addict with clammy hands
Leaking my paraphernalia everywhere
Told Lori I'll never do coke again, but she did what she did
And I'm here again, I ain't pointing no fingers
I'm still a man
No, I'm more than that
You would know if you scrolled through my older tracks
I'm just the Romeo mourning his Juliet
Hadid incomplete without Lou Reed
And do me a favor and save all that satanist shit
You pagans gone pay for this shit
I studies theology, ancient philosophy, astronomy, astrology
The current state of the economy
Washington D.C, fossils and dinosaurs
The origin of our species
Monatomic gold
Flowers grown in feces
Christ Conscious, Pishon, mocking Jesus
The chicken came before the eggs, the thesis
I bet she's an evil genius

Disobedient, villain you hate to love
Mischievous, mysterious, miscellaneous
Used to make love to complex simplicity all the time
Now she my star and I'm her sky and I ain't afraid to die
I don't give a fuck!
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind (I don't give a fuck)
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck
I'm young mind fuck

Heaven is missing its angel of fire
Your passion is needed right here on this earth
When the Lord calls for you after you die
I'll wait past my lifetime for you to return
You be my star
I'll be your sky
You can hide underneath me and come out at night
And when I turn jet black and you show off your light
I live to let you shine
I live to let you shine


"Hey Soul"
"Wassup G G"
"I finally figured out..."
"Thank God for girls"
"God's a girl"

(God's a girl, God's a girl, God's)
I ain't gon' lie, you got me cryin' with a hard dick (amen)
How I love you so much that I hate this shit?
I get it get it, I (don't stop)
You ain't doin' your job if you don't say (oh, my god)
Come have sex with Jesus
Come have sex with Jesus (Soulo)
Come have sex with Jesus
You ain't doin' your job if you don't say (oh, my god)

Every single time, yeah
And all I got is goddesses, I'm a heroine addict..
That's it, that's it
Yeah cause I.. I really wanted to talk about like
You know, it's crazy how you know like you know, how Jesus is in the bible and he don't get no pussy at all
A 33 year old virgin
Yeah it's crazy
Like all the drugs are girls
Mary, Molly
Yeah for real, they're all named after girls
And they're really like female plants and shit

Yes Lord (Black Lip Pastor)
We in Frankies castle with the pack though
Motherfucking pack
Top want me to go to rehab
Told him I would go too
Probably just relapse
Cause that's what ill niggas do
Won't even pop a bottle without poppin a pill
Can't have a meal without picking up the bill
Should be more concerned with my health
But I'm gonna die trying to get this wealth
Pay attention nigga
I've been going platinum, they just trying to take it
Fuck boys acting up, like an adult film audition
I'm just eating these rappers up
Sending artists to the mortician
I'm just with my niggas hanging, case of champagne
Need some water but I'd rather me a martyr for the cause
Nigga y'all niggas still don't get it
Juvenile never went to juvenile hall
It was 400 degrees on terminals
The homies playing with the strap off safety
And my lady at the time she stayed on gun lock
The irony in that alone is crazy
I come up with shit like that that's why they say I'm crazy
Maybe
I'm with the shits, I'm off the shits
(YMF)
Rockstar lifestyle might not make it
But I guarantee she make it to the penthouse naked
You niggas been outdated
Like the bitches I dated way way way way back when
Now I'm getting brain in the tenant's Maybach Benz
It's rented but I'm in it nigga
I didn't pay back
More insufficient funds in the last 5 months than you gonna make in this whole year
On the mountain top about to cry cause it gets so lonely up here
Is anybody out there?
Can anybody hear me?
In this jaded generation of complacency siri don't even take us seriously
But that's some other shit just being honest with you
Right hand on the bible with you
My ancestors came on the mothership
So I got to take it farther nigga that makes sense

My head in the clouds
Getting head in the clouds
By an angel in disguise
She an angel in disguise
D'evils gonna be my demise
I swear that God's a girl, bitch


[Ab-Soul:]
Check it out, hey
This is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And if you roll another blunt and keep your mouth shut
I'll tell you how I became the wicked nigga they call Young Mind Fuck
Black out, black out
(Youngin' from Del Amo)
Black out, black out
(Belt by Ferrigamo)
Black out, black out, black out, yeah
Ay, black out

They speak highly of me when I raise my voice
I gotta shoot a fucking free throw to make my point
My wittiness leave 'em stuck in the wilderness
You need a backwood to roll to this joint
I'm Robin Hood in Robin jeans, you follow me?
Never mind I'm tired of tight analogies
Still in pursuit of happiness in the midst of the madness
With middle fingers to bitches with badges that go oink
(Yeah! Yeah!)
I'm on the fence with Common Sense
My logic is sound, talk of the 90746
No shit, Sherlock
Remind 'em of Han Solo on the battlefront
Everybody behind Soulo and they backin' up
I just threw my two-step, let her back it up
Go on back it up, go on back it up...
You dry snitchin', I'm sliding in something moist
You annoy these women, I anoint these women
You stressin' on my schedule and appointment with 'em
They let me cut so much, I bring ointment nigga
I'm lubricant slick baby
I'm hornier than the brass section of the band, you understand?
Pick your poison, it's your choice

Hey, I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
(Lil homie from the hood)
Yeah, with a belt by Ferragamo
(Yeah bitch I look good)
Hey, just doing want I wanna
This ain't marijuana, please don't tell my mama

I'ma black out, black out, black out, black out
You telling white lies while I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Pale white horse when I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Spark the white lighter then I black out
Even white lives matter when I black out
Bucket of black paint in-front the white house nigga

(Yeah! Yeah!)
I hope I'm in Obama's iPod
Yeah, 'fore I had a desktop
Was looking for a shortcut to be an icon
But this time it's for the money my nigga
Me and the Ichabod Don got itchy palms
And I just left Emmet's with a jar and a intercom
I'ma act an ass and have a donkey to pin it on
I'm winning no matter what the decision's depending on
I'm sinister, picture a ticking bomb in the Pentagon
The typical shit I've been on, remember the pen is gone
Your pinnacle's penny pinching, I'm getting nickels for my thoughts
Like Slim Shady in Balmain jeans
Difficult to say I'm vision impaired, all I seen
I'm Yamborghini High, A$AP M-O-B
Your 16 is pint sized to me

Hey, I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
(Lil homie from the hood)
Hey, with a belt by Ferragamo
(Yeah bitch I look good)
Hey, just doing want I wanna
This ain't marijuana, please don't tell my mama

I'ma black out, black out, black out, black out
You telling white lies while I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Pale white horse when I black out
Black out, black out, black out, black out
Spark the white lighter then I black out
Even white lives matter when I black out
Bucket of black paint in-front the white house nigga

[Da$H:]
Young, no shame, Kurt Cobain, bastard son
With a gun in palm, money, pussy, crime sitting on my mind
No emotion, orange bottles how I deal with mine
Cracking bannies, only time a nigga cross the line
Wrong hand signs'll turn a function to Columbine
Yeah, So, B.o.B's top gunner
Front runner, never die clique, the thing you are not brother
Polo Ralph Lauren is keeping the Glock covered
Pour up medication by the brick
Sipping oil like we're tryna sink a ship
So, Teag, uppers and the downers in the mix
Now the film heads talking 'bout a script
Living my days is a gamble
I guess that's the perks of the set, bet
Ain't nothing certain but dirt that bitch wearing that skirt
So I guess that I'm flirting with death
Need the type of cash cow to get Trump whacked out
Here's the question you should ask
What's the Soul without the Da$H
Never had the option I could back out
If it's 'bout the cash then I act out

[Da$H & Ab-Soul:]
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Black out, black out
Yeah, so


Say hip hop (hip hop)
Say hip hop (hip hop)

[Ab-Soul (Kokane):]
A-L, Now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the Lord my soul's a G
H, wait if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
Cuz He is and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

[Ab-Soul:]
They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Nuclear power plants and missiles, real warfare
This where the wealthy need welfare
I'm an immortal man on healthcare
My cautious conscience give me nightmares
I stopped dreaming many eons ago tho
I paid my dues and rocked the bells like Quasimodo
On the low tho, Soulo only artist on crown without a solo album in the stores tho
I got my opinions
What do you suggest?
It's been a drill to be ill, you ain't really sick
Who you a-mucinex?

[Ab-Soul (Kokane):]
A-L, Now I lay me down to sleep
L-A, I pray the lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
'Cause He is and I am Him (Soulo)
Yes He is and I am Him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

Muthafuck the government
Muthafuck the system
Muthafuck you, I'm just living..

[Ab-Soul:]
Aye man, I'm sorta a rock and a hard place
Like a guitar in the Hard Rock Cafe
They argue about me in barber shops when I got cropped
Hmm... What a paradox
I'm borderline crazy with a stamped up passport
Getting past TSA with shit stashed, smelling like a hundred ashtrays
Little white kids asking for my autograph
Hey man, I'm off half a xan, off to my aircraft

[Ab-Soul (Kokane):]
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G
H, wait, if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
'Cause he is and I am him (Soulo)
Yes he is and I am him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them

Muthafuck the government
Muthafuck the system
Muthafuck you

So I say, so I say, so I say, catch another plane
Represent my hood in every state up in the USA
I'm feeling good today, feeling good to be from D.A
I had to do it

[Ab-Soul:]
Back to the music, back to the fact I'm actually stupid
Stupid meaning genius, come suck Jesus' penis on Venus
Back to reality, sadly I'm actually Jewish
Or whatever you wish to call me, I don't wanna offend nobody (l'chaim)
Just remind them all, that it's real
Like when the Ark of the Covenant is still
Foolish humans this is faith without the H
The work is never done dummy, the lazy will be late
A stewardess who was familiar with my music said: âYou must be living the lifeâ
I looked at her with my red eyes like:
"I ain't going on no vacation
I ain't going on no vacation
I ain't going on no vacation
'Till I fulfill my vocation"

[Ab-Soul (Kokane):]
A.L. Now I lay me down to sleep
L.A. I pray the lord my soul's a G
H, wait,  if I OD before I wake
I pray I resurrect with a hangover on the third day
Godbody
'Cause he is and I am him (Soulo)
Yes he is and I am him (Soulo)
He is and I am him (Soulo)
They ain't me and I ain't them (Soulo)


[Ab-Soul, SZA & Thundercat:]
I said leave me lone, leave me lone...
Leave me lone, leave me lone, leave me lone...

I'm conflicted to my amazement, I'm just amazed
Slim, silver spoon in my mouth
Spoiled little Carson kid with chandelier up in my shed
Future's looking dim and Ab-Soul wear shades
Cause Punch told me to punch him in the face
Make a statement we enslaved the salvation with my waking words
I kept the Soul in the alphabet, the alpha-male in my era, I'm here to baffle them like the Baphomet
They ain't know what the cover of my second album meant
I mean the booth if I'm asking you where the bathroom at.
Before the whole wide world eye balled Top Dawg
They wouldn't even give this cat a rack to perform
Sure Lori was more than empathetic but the seven hundred I got took her to Lori's instead of iHop
My high-school sweetheart turned my ticker so bitter
Still staying strong for Ray, CJ, and all our little sisters
Vaneesha just had Jameel, that's my third nephew Cory's adorable and Cody still missed you
All my thoughts are lavender and pastel green, if you was Newey you would know what I mean (weed)
Hundred proof Absolut in the back of your Acura
Donny Hathaway on repeat
My mentor asked me what happens after Control System
Well hate to tell him the system control's me...Please

[Ab-Soul & SZA:]
Leave me lone, leave me lone...
I said leave me lone...

Spit crack, they don't want, they can't take it
Long lost members sergeant pepper's lonely heart club band Getting high with a little bit of help from my friends
The rifles to my rivals all my homies got a homie that bodied one of my homies, yo that cycle is psycho
A coward killed my brother Georgiano and his momma and I'm complaining bout a album
What is my problem?
...

[Punch:]
Guess I'm a really pervis in the face
He survived by the God's grace
Ironically hearing my uncle share the same birthday
Is it fate or is it faith?
I just might be in your hood still
Lonely soul itching for a love that I've once known but I've outgrown it
I told Famous be patient, I'm in the hills
While this world is caving in and I'm living a vacation
Or so it seems, to the wig it's all in
What does it take to find a coffin to make these niggas crawl in?
I tried to stall him but I ain't have no alternative
I told him to think smart, he told me get it how I live
Point taken, lord
Why have we forsaken us?
Blasting that Satan for salvation, feels Pagan
Graced in the Land of Canaan
But my new world translation speaks of a different arrangement
When Death meets death eternal breath fills my lungs
Death forever paid in the name of God's son
Currently wasting away in this wicked system
Scared to pray for forgiveness cause I ain't sure if I repent it
Oh what an existence
In fact is this really living?
Drowning in my own expenses while tryna make Soul listen to my infinite wisdom

[Ab-Soul, SZA & Thundercat:]
I said leave me lone...
Leave me lone, leave me lone...


Try to relax, try to relax
I know you're anxious, baby
I know you're anxious, for me
But you just gotta try to relax, try to relax
I wrote the majority of this rap on a bean bag under the JMZ train tracks, the Bro P on the motherfucking boards, homeboy
(If you don't know, now ya know nigga)

Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doin' what I want to
You know what I'm up to
I hit the Bodega for the backwoods
Pack of dutchies if you lucky nigga
Cups with the ice just doing just doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
(Git up, git out and git something)
Aye, you know what I'm up to

I swear to God I wish I wrote this fucking verse on Mother's Day
That ain't got shit to do with this or does it? Fuck it, Anyway
I've been miseducated, mislead, misinterpretated, misunderstood, mistaken, misjudged
That's why I'm a misfit, up to mischief
On a mission, in a missionary
Hittin missionaries (missionaries)
That was all mises, terms with 'mis' prefixes to be specific
All you feminists should be on my dick for this shit (word)
But listen close, this where shit get tricky
What all these words have in common is that they're all iffy
Hence misogyny, obviously
I'd switch the 'y' in 'mystery' with 'i' if I could (I would)
If you was Huey you would know it nigga
But you're not so I guess y'all good
So one time for the women, two times for the ladies, three times for the bitches
Don't forget about the bitches
Adam's rib ain't adding up, this story must be more extensive (YMF nigga)
Meiosis, mitosis and some mo' shit
Noah had motion in the ocean before his boat did
And you know why, I love my mama so much
And I can't watch my lil sister grow up, so I

Went from Del's liquor to Deli's in the Bronx nigga
I'm just a youngin from Del Amo
With a belt by Ferragamo doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to
I hit the Bodega for the backwoods
Pack of dutchies if you lucky nigga (cross your fingers)
Cups with the ice just doing what I want to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
Yeah baby, you know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to, You know what I'm up to
You know what I'm up to
Baby, you know what I'm up to

I, Soulo, still a member in good standing of the he-man woman haters club.
Do solemnly swear to be a he-man and hate women and not play with them or talk to them unless I have to,
and especially, never fall in love, and if I do may I die slowfully and painfully and suffer for hours, or until I scream bloody murder


[Portishead In The Morning]

"Light from the brightest supernova of the 20th century reaches Earth from 168,000 light-years away. At the University of Torontoâs observatory in the foothills of the Andes mountains, 30-year-old astronomer Ian Shelton was looking at photographic plates in the wee hours of Feb. 24, while listening to Pink Floydâs The Wall. The plates covered an area near the Large Magellanic Cloud, when he spotted an exceptionally bright spot"

I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make, make me take my life back

Demigod with a record deal
Everything's puny to me, you a newbie
I'm from Niburu, microphone check 1, 2, 3
Master of ceremony no matter the territory, I'm cozy
Oz a OG, my brain playing ring around the rosy
The fried egg in my head defies science
I'm Bill Nye, going to great heights to stay the highest
Call me Soulo hoe the prophet, but do you really comprehend it?
Is it prophet meaning messenger, or prophet meaning expenses?
Pick it... ah, forget it

I'm the brightest silver lining
'Cause I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make, make me take my life back

"When he walked outside the observatory"

The philosopher getting stoned
It's no doubt in my mind I found the philosopher's stone
Thought these were just songs that I write? You're wrong
Move my mouth and move a mountain with ease as well
Dead ass, I'ma live forever like the HeLa cell
My nigga [?] said "Ab you a genius but you gotta go stupid
Sometimes in order to win you gotta lose it"
My goal was to hit the hitters to glitches in the system
Do we really want to go to heaven? Ain't no bitches mentioned (this is a man's world)
I ain't a sexist, I enlighten sisters too
Oh yes, it's Bohemian Grove baby, not groove
One time for the women, two times...
I'm from another galaxy, I'm actually an android
Look me up on your galaxies and your androids
The devil was created, he is not a creator
And energy can neither be created or destroyed
It's YMF nigga, YMF nigga
If I ain't the messiah, I'm a mess nigga
YMF nigga, YMF nigga
If I ain't the messiah, I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
I'm the brightest silver lining
Don't make, make me take my life back

"That spot did turn out to be supernova 1987A. When he walked outside the observatory, the object was visible to the naked eye. The plates covered an area near the Large Magellanic Cloud, when he spotted an exceptionally bright spot"

[HER World]

She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands
She's got the whole world in her hands

Ay man, there's more than one reason why there is only one
Remember that first or end before you've begun
I rhyme like I'm God's only begotten son
She so loved the world she gave Soul the world
That's why I just have fun, and use my third eye like I just had one
God gotta be a thot, the blood from your erection come from your brain and your feet, so you can' think and you can't run


Raw backwards on all you rappers...

[Ab-Soul:]
What's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
I'm low-key, like a locksmith
Working on both knees
You nosy, wire tap bands
Got fur on where my toes be
I'm cosy
Act like you know me
Wicked as Aleister Crowley
I just might OD
Overly dedicated, just like my homie
Second to none in the first place, I need a trophy
Doing whatever I please, it's like fuck your feelings
Man I got so many flows, them shits come with ceilings
What's my name? They call me Ab-Soul, the abstract asshole
I'm levitating, way too crazy
Way too wavy for your sandcastle

Ay man what's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
The backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

[Zacari:]
We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Ab-Soul:]
I'm going loco
This nigga Soulo back in this hoe though
Oh no you watchin' Hulu, I run the show tho
Is it music? Voodoo? I don't know
But don't confuse me with D'Angelo
I'm the angel of
Spooky, hope your army got lots of armor
Cuz we don't die, we just multiply, divide and conquer
Remember when the battle mongers called me a reject
'Till I had all this heart and honor, demand my respect
Now I walk through C-A-R-son like I'm a hero
Steps ahead and stacking bread up, speaking of heroes
47 shit, fuck it, fly to the Beast Coast
Just to sag down Troy Ave. quoting King Steelo
Pass the pot, let me skill it
The temperature is scalding
The novices make me nauseous
I was like a swami of Jay Electronica until he
Figured Dizzle wouldn't admit that he would body him for a milli
I told Kenny keep quiet, I'ma get him
We don't need dirt on your hands getting the key to the city ya feel me
Hurts when your OG, who is supposed to be a G-O-D
Is standing next to King Kunta feeling like Toby
Moos what I gotta do boy?
I'm just waiting on your cue to take him to school boy!
Fuck all this wordplay
Top, tell these fucking stooges I'm dangerous, keep away!
Mayday

Ay man what's happening? Another baptism by pastor black lip
I'm mashing across the masses
My movement massive
The backwoods with the gas in it
You roll the raw, I spell it backwards
Throw that wack shit up in the trash can

[Zacari:]
We don't wanna hear that wack shit no more
No more
No more, no more
No more, no more

[Ab-Soul:]
I'm Wiccan like a wicked witch I need Alia Zin
To read Genesis
'Cause this one for my fellow Thelemites
About that fucking life
You fucking right, I need to
Stand up for my fucking rights
Out of sight, out of mind
Still leave insight in your brain
Got your synapses doing jumping jacks and all kind of things
I mean check my subject range
Agartha, Dopamine, choppers, stick talk, Benihana, PF Chang's
Revelations reiterated
This revolutionary
Shit you bump that gives you goosebumps
'Cause the truth is scary
Do What Thou Wilt
I'm not talented, I'm skilled
I'm the darkest knight, with the shiniest shield
Would've attended to university, but it was silly to me
Because the whole universe is just a city to me


[Ab-Soul:]
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law
Yeah
Love, Love is the law, love is the only law
You should, you should do without

I've been slewing through the mail
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female
ASAP
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Hey
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time

I get the feeling that you only playing hard to get
Cause you ain't forget how much I love a challenge
I know we were divided to restore the balance
Hope I still get you wet while you bending over backwards
Watching over me in ecstacy expecting me
Ya number is 6 and 50 interestingly
I hope you're still blue, with golden ovaries
On your tippy toes for me, just how you posed to be
They spoke of us in Cairo quite some time ago
How these atoms adapt to this it's incredible
They love to go to sleep, but hate to be awake
Treat the eye of horus as if it's just a symbol
Unattainable, they read the wrong rights
They see the signs but ain't see what the sign saw
But luckily love is the only law
Love is the, love is the only..

[Mac Miller:]
I've been slewing through the mail
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female
ASAP
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Take your time baby

Cause all my thoughts are lavender and pastel green
And you the only one that know what I mean
You know what I mean

And they say our separation was sacrificial and all
But I'm in awe
These hybrids getting high but they don't get it at all
The pain of division is nothing
The joy of disillusion is all but I'm in awe man
I know that you were my discarded woman
Like to say you everything but nothing
But you nothing but my everything
How shall I explain
Aye man

I've been slewing through the mail
Fishing for a feed, to feed my female
ASAP, yeah
Nature is a mother, and life is a bitch
I am convinced, yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Yeah
God coming she just taking her time
God coming she just taking her time
Take your time baby

One time for the women
Two times for the ladies
Three times for the bitches
Can't forget about the Queen

[Rapsody:]
Queens, we are nodding back
Understand we are his back and
When he puts the arc in your back understand
That we took him to heaven where those golden arcs are at
Golden as sundrops, Queen
When he looks in your eyes you show him where the stars are at
And your beautiful, beautiful darkness
And in return he replies that girl I'll be your night
Your knight in shining armor
Cause you're my heart, queen
And lying on his chest our hearts beat box
And you and I are queens
We remind him that he can be all ours
Cause we all Gods
And God is Queen and God is love and
Love stays above all
Heaven, stars, queen, God, God

Love
Love
Love
Love is the law
Love is the only law
Love is the only law
Love

Ay yo Bentley, remember that chick you brought by the studio?
You thought that was your woman, your woman
Ain't your woman, she's soul's woman
It's love tho B it's love
Yeah


Look
It go 1, 2, 3 (turn it up)
The Devil's after me (little louder)
4, 5, 6
She's always throwing sticks (yeah)
7, 8, 9
She misses every time (little louder)
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
I'm more than a man
(Ey ey, yo man, g-g-get your hand out of my pocket)

This time around
We taking atheists to church
Serving serpents with sermons with curse words
You can do all things through Jesus Christ
All the time God is good
And God is good all the time
24/7 all day
Every week
Numerous funeral services
For PaKK music beats
(Do What Thou Wilt)
The front line is behind me
And I have no fear
My heart pump the same blood as Jehovah's son
Or Joseph if you wanna go there
Hail Mary
Coming up with lies
To tell fairies out of nowhere
Can't help my selfish desires
My life is 'bout the vices, nigga (yeah, so)
It could all be so simple
But its complicated
I go around the whole nation
Saying stop the violence
But its ten times hard enough alone
Fighting temptation face facts
Still wicked as Aleister Crowley
You niggas know me
No, you niggas don't know me
I take that back
Noticed the dead man that's chalked out
On the bottom of the brim
Of my deadline snapback
I used to shop at Lids
But I'm still over niggas heads
Like ceilings and bright ideas
I'm just an awkward Carson kid
With chandelier up in my shit
My soul on fire got this threatening nature from Ras Kass
An atom is a molecule
Adam was a maricon
But if he would've never ate that apple
He'd be mad sad
And would've never pulled the leaves off of Eve
And seen all that ass
Like a true mack
True dat, true dat, sit tight
Listen, listen, hear, and understand
Or just give me some insight
You get on your knees every night to pray to a man
That you barely understand or have even seen with your eyes closed
Then turn around and do the same thing
Get on your knees then put a ring on the woman that you wanna call your wife
Something ain't right yo

(Soul, let these motherfuckers know)
Way back when I was in grade school I learned about history
But what about her story, did anybody ask?
With all disrespect
I think the American flag was designed by fags
I had it locked before the spotlight
I got a gold key and Benjamin Franklin's kite
Nigga I'm bright
This HiiiPower shit is limitless
You tryna fuck a model
And I'm trying to deflower Queen Elizabeth
Just to be precise, who knew that Genesis really meant
The genealogy of ISIS, this shit ridiculous
The chicken came before the egg is my hypothesis and
This ain't a album, this an algorithm, yeah
We went from picking cotton for men in wigs and stockings
To liberation and renaissances
What is this nonsense?
And we don't speak on sexism much as we really should
The black man could vote before the woman could
You singing hymns in church, I'm looking for the hers
In 66 books in the bible, they ain't let a lady say one word
Hilary Clinton is out somewhere trying to get ahead in the Senate
I'm getting head and I'm sinning
Nigga I'm threatening nature


[Wifey Vs. WiFi]

[Ab-Soul:]
Man, I hate quoting Jay-Z, cuz is just too tight
Is he a Blood is he Crip? Is he that, is he this? Will he do it? You know, it!

(Uh, ay, man)
Now every time I say "it" it's in reference to my dick
You can suck it if you want to
Every time I say "it" it's in reference to my dick
And you can suck it motherfucking bitch

Listen bitch
When it's in you the sentiment is incredible
Winter fresh even, I even undress your winter clothes
When it's out, instead of worrying about where it's at
You'd rather rack your cap about where it's going or where it's been
Where are we going? I'm beginning to see an end
Don't bring Larry King in this
Sniff the evidence on my clothes
And go through my cell phone and
Now I'm in jail for leaving out a few details, oh well

It's wifey or WiFi, (ay) wifey or WiFi, (ay) wifey or WiFi
Got some niggas in the pen that really gotta face time
She just bitching cause I missed her Facetime
It's wifey or WiFi, (ay) wifey or WiFi, (ay) wifey or WiFi
Got some niggas really having issues in the cell
She just bitching cause them other bitches in my cell, oh well

Oh well
I guess she wanna go to war then
I guess we should  warn the warden
Oh well, oh well

Alright I want you to tweet me right now if you're using your third iPhone
It's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi
It's wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi, wifey or WiFi
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh I hit you with the hash back
Ay

My nigga lil' Riley got into it with his mommy
They be fighting all the time so I ain't pay it no mind
He said: "God, she could really be the devil" I said "Chill"
He smacked his teeth and shook his head and said: "No, for real!
You know I love her but she could really be a pain in the ass
Matter fact, fuck that, pull out your jack real fast
Real shit my nigga
Now glance at the keypad
This that mind boggling shit you like to throw in your raps
And this might be your best yet
Notice how every number represents three letters of the alphabet
Like 2 is A-B-C, 3 is D-E-F, 4 is G-H-I"
I said: "I get it, alright!"
He said: "Now trip off this:
Listen to me Soul
I know you off the shits but I'ma need you to get a grip"
I said: "Be serious"
He said "Dial M-O-M"
What a hella coincidence, it was 6-6-

[P.M.S.]

[BR3:]
All because of this penitentiary mind state. Is it my fate?
For God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?
I kept it real, and I ain't never been fake
I'm feeling like Biggie when he lost faith

See this penitentiary mind state. Is it my fate?
For God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?
I kept it real, and I ain't never been fake
I'm feeling like Biggie when he lost faith

Look, there's sixty seconds left
I'ma have to get back later
Ya boy chasing this penitentiary paper
Tell my momma "stay on point"
Your phone hit her on three-way
Then fuck it I'ma hit her on that other joint
First term nigga
But I did it like a vet
Hung up the phone, and when I asked: "Who had next?"
It was one of the lifers, all nest with no neck
Gotta stay with my striker, no nigga is no threat
I swipe my knife on the under
But I can still hear it in my ear when he said: "That's right youngster
Just stay focused
Sleep with your ears open
Beat 'em with a long-handled spoon when you deal with smokers"
I sag low when I walk the yard, hold my head high
Yaddada to them bay niggas
Me, I'm from the west side
Looking for a gram to steal
Cause I'm tryna' get high
Thinking bout my fake ass bitch on the outside
Out of sight, out of mind, shit, oh my
Long as the nigga make the paper when he doing time
Right look, fuck it I'm lying
I'm just retrying to hold out
Thought of some trick running dick in my bitch

My penitentiary mind state. Is it my fate?
For God's sakes, why did I have to lose the case?
I kept it real, and I ain't never been fake
I'm feeling like Biggie when he lost faith

Look, hold up


The goal is not to..uh..make my cup full
"What's the goal? What's the ultimate goal..?
One wrong move in this motherfucker

Look, I got two baby mommas
But I ain't got no kids. Nah, I'm fucking with you
They my lesbian friends
Real shit, they been together for over a few years
Every time I smell the sage burning man I think of them
Jade wanna be a surrogate and carry my kids
I'd probably give Lonnie cash if she will really lemme hit
We think she Nefertiti and I believe it
Unisex said that she turned gold to rent her DMT trip

[Ab-Soul & ScHoolboy Q:]
Cause I like girls that like girls that's in love with me
Just promise me you'll remain anonymous
She said am I faithful
I said I'm womanogamist
Womanogamist, womanogamist
She asked am I faithful
Womanogamist, womanogomist
Cause I like girl that like (I like girls that like)
From the whom to the tomb nigga
Put that womb in the tomb nigga (womanogomist)
I said from the womb to the tomb nigga
Keep that womb in the tomb nigga (womanogomist)
From the womb to the tomb nigga
Leave that womb in the tomb nigga

Amber Rose taught you how to be a bad bitch
This should be your favorite track, bitch (turn it up fool)

I'm a pisces
I got Aphrodite in my back pocket
On the ring of my keys
Hope her and her son Eros
Get where they supposed to go
They playing tug of war with me
And I can't bend no more
I'm too emotional for that
But I don't show it
If I'm two fishes tied by the tail
Then where am I goin
Hold that thought, next scene
Shit, it would be the morning
I give her morning wood then roll my wood up in the morning
Finesse this flow from Lucki Eck$
I'm finger fucking mother earth
Put my thumb up in her butt
Then roll like a was bowling
Getting comatose and high
They on my pole 'cause I told them
I guess if you was Huey you would know it
Christ died at 33 and she at 33
And she was born on two eleven, that's a robbery
Damn, she done stole my heart from me

[Ab-Soul & ScHoolboy Q:]
Cause I like girls that like girls that's in love with me
Just promise me you'll remain anonymous
She said am I faithful

Hey, hey, hey

Hey, man!

It's only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave
It's only cause I care about you
Put a smile on your face
Say the truth will set you free
I'll be your slave

Cause I'm a liar, a cheater, a devil in disguise and a deceiver
If I was you and you was me, I wouldn't believe you
The tricky part is my fingers' crossed, cause I could even by lying

And I don't wanna take the time
Said, I don't wanna take the time
To write down, what I feel on my mind, right now
I don't wanna take the time
Never even take the time
To write down, what I feel on my mind right now

I gotta wear shades everyday
It's difficult to figure me out
You're supposed to look a man up in his eye
They don't even know what eye is about
Is he non-fiction or not?
Is it politics or hip-hop?
Do What Thou Wilt
Love is the only law
Love under will, the law is for all
And then I said that I would carry the cross
That wasn't just a quote I stole from Nas (naw)
And like I said, It wasn't written
But still I'm taking over with this ether
And since he got a new bitch
He ain't dropped no new music, either
Told my lady I was an alien; she believed my ass
I said sike!
I didn't tell you E.T. was back

Only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave

If you are
That one girl, very far away
That'll come around when I'm in town
Even with your man from many years
With plans of church and wedding gowns
And other portions of the big picture
You'll leave out of the portrait
That you will paint for me after I perform my recordings
And I say the shit that stimulates your mind, body and spirit
Resonate with your receptors, you never knew existed
Your phone on silent
You got an alibi for your boo
And before you say bye, you say you love me
And I'ma say I love you too

Only cause I care about you
Wipe those tears from your face
They say the truth will set you free
Baby I'll be your slave

In the beginning, I created the heavens and the earth
Now, the earth was formless and empty
Darkness was over the surface of the deep
And my spirit was hovering over the waters
And I said, let there be light


[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Yeah, yeah...
I called you back I'm glad you didn't answer baby
Cause every-time we talk I always feel the static baby
Could be the distance, yeah
You spoke the truth into existence to degrade yourself
Told me keep it G as if you told yourself
Knew that I was on the move
I got to prove my theories to be true

[Hook - Ab-Soul & Jhene Aiko:]
I know it's getting hard to think about me
I know it's hard to see me on the TV
I know you wish you never met me
I liked you better when you didn't like me
Things just ain't the same no more
Things just ain't the same no more
Still think about you everyday
And I wish I could stay
But things just ain't the same no more

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I don't regret a second that we shared, hell no
In fact I often wish that you was here, right now, ow, ow
Cause' when Lori left me you was right there
Lord knows you had the right care
I wonder if you still praying to the East
I wonder if you ever forgave me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
I know I said it'll be just one time
But it felt so good that I came back twice
And I take full blame
But in this word of selfish men
You keep your heart inside your chest
And not in someone else's hand


[Hook:]
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Rolling around like "fuck it"
Now I got a OZ in this Benz, still rolling around like "fuck it"
OZ in this Benzo, rolling around like "fuck it"
Rolling around like "fuck it", rolling around like "fuck it"

[Verse 1:]
That shit weak, your bitch weak that's too bad, my bitch bad
Smoke weed, I got plenty, take your quarter back like McNabb
Sip lean, I got plenty, I drop a ace in a liter now I got a quinceaÃ±era
Ever had a chick to do it on the dick to capoeira
Kick game like Martial Arts kick game like Marshall Law
On Tekken the homies got weapons Martial Law could happen any second
Getting money, blowing digits only sexing sexy women
Only sexin' sexy women only sex is sexy women
That like to do them nasty things you know I like them nasty things
Can't fuck with them whips and chains I got a bitch that do, but I ain't got no gavel
Baby wanna know what's under my belt maybe cause I paid so much for the belt
Call the car service, get your ass home, but just yesterday me and Agent J

[Hook]

[Post-Hook:]
What's happenin'? [x8]
OZ in this Benzo
OZ in this Benzo
Just a lil' Carson, nigga [x8]

[Verse 2:]
You're so weak, you don't know me
Soulo so lowkey in Lord, legends, infinity
Oh God showed off inventing me
Me and K with the promoter
Drop the fo' up in the soder
I'm unraveling backwoods
And he's bending corners, just thought I'd warn ya
Whats happening?
I've been gone too long, but bitch I'm back again
Except this time I'm old
Had that Chevy celebrity the same age as me
With that gram in the glove-box, that's a 2 for 15
I mean

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You still weak, you last week
I'm next month, twist the next blunt
The homie got his chain took at the Mixed Nuts
Now we blowing big weed, lean mixed up
Nigga, don't get shit misconstrued
We gave y'all plenty time to dig our stuff
Getting women in the mood
We tell the truth up in the nude
Breaking news, breaking news
I'm enlightening like Pikachu
All I do is what you wouldn't think to do
Silk, don't you remember that [?]
South Pole Jeans, fat laces in all our shoes
A nigga turned into an oracle
Treat the damn booth like a urinal
Smoking a stogie in a terminal
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Rolling around like "fuck it"
Paul Jeremy, Doe and me trying to match a nugget
Pass the blunt to BC, AR, and AJ
King Rich, YM, Python P, I put that on me
I had a dub sack in my bucket
Capital C

(Eh niggas out here look silly, my nigga
Like bruh, if you don't know me look at my fucking Twitter, my nigga)
I just might be in yo hood
(It's your boy A-Mack out here man, Zanzilla, slapping niggas and bitches for fun, straight like that)

[Verse 4 - Punch:]
Niggas chased my uncle there, through God's grace the gun jammed
I found comfort in this pleasure, meaning I slept the best through gun sounds
These Days it's a little different, between me and my past I put a little distance
Egyptian cotton, thread count vicious
Started as a dream, manifested into little Kendrick
Now everybody feel it, even niggas who didn't know, they try to forget it!
Selective Amnesia, that's an Oxymoron, These Days
Niggas ask about pressure I grew up watching free base
Literally the face of my hood...
So basically I beat the case
I vanished but left a trace, just in-case a nigga gotta go back
Yeah, it's not for games if I say that

[Hook - Ab-Soul & SZA:]
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood
I just might be in yo hood


[Intro:]
6:19 in the morning nigga

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Let me start off with this statement
I'm the motherfucking greatest
I ain't even have too many haters
All my niggas knew I was gon' make it
From performing at Pep Rallys, showcases, talent shows
That I had to sell tickets for, just to get up in that ho

Now raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!
Raise your hand say Soulo Ho!

I'm rolling up in the tour bus
Just rolling up in the tour bus
Free said put the weed out they don't play that in Virginia
But I'm finna continue, pass the fire to my nigga Tone
Couldn't find a fire but this far from home
But we still trying, I mean we still chiefing
She thinks it's cool, she took a puff, she still freaking
I popped a bean, fell asleep, woke up, and started thinking

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
Man this shit pays hanging in the House of Pain
Now we sipping champagne on the motherfucking plane
Cause they Feeling Us, they Feeling Us, They Feeling Us
Are you Feeling us?
They Feeling Us, they Feeling Us, they Feeling Us
Are you Feeling Us?

Cause everywhere I go, man I swear they know my name
Make your girlfriend cry when she see me walk by
Cause they Feeling Us, they Feeling Us, they Feeling Us

[Verse 2 - Jay Rock:]
Yeah I'm liquored up, this a celebration
TDE the shit... thanks to all you haters!
I'm Jay Rock, yeah the OG, me and Soulo blowing OG
Hit the stage, then beat the case, then get the cake, then burn trees
Shake hands, kiss babies, show love, throw 3s
I was on the block with a quarter key, like what the fuck is a 16?
I was so anti-social, nigga wasn't outspoken
Till I picked up a mic, story of my life!
Uh, came with the piece so keep the peace
Uh, I ain't tryna hurt nobody
I ain't sweating no vendetta, champagne on my breath in the hotel lobby
You feel me? Damn right you feel me!
Got them sigh, she feel me and them paparazzi feel me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
I'm feeling fine and dandy
Staying awake off this Xanny
Knock knock off this weed can one of yall find another Backwood please?
I just know that I can be, an example of what you can be
Making a way for my homies, making it easy for my family
So mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
No mama don't frown no more, mama don't frown no more
Told me I'm smarter than you, you just gotta trust me yo
I stole from the record store, still selling, records though
Yeah...
(Love you Grandma!)
Ain't no shame, in my game
They know my name in Montreal, they sing my songs cause they relate
They Feelin Us, cause we can't be touched, thank God for Top and Punch
Ho-Ho-Hold on... Drop the drums
These bitches love Soulo, Del Amo to Soho
Fucking with them TopDawgs, you'll just look like toto
Do it all for Soulo, I don't even know them
Hol Up here we go again... Justin bring the chorus in!

[Hook]


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Hey Ali? Yeah that's right
I can hear myself good now, finally

[Hook - SZA:]
Is this how it is These Days?
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to move These Days

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Your soul sits on your third eye, Soul sits on the throne
Told you I was the third wheel, that's three wheel motion on chrome
Three's up, three's up, all around the world
We ain't shooting no jumpshots, but we balling, we balling
I'm from where they get jumped or shot 'til they falling, they falling
They ain't heard one word from God but he calling, he calling
I ain't never had a whole rack, til' I was 24 years old
At 25 I spent a hunnid' of those and still ain't got nothing to show
Uh, I guess that's how it is These Days...
Uh, I guess that's how it goes
Cause this world is dark and my Locs is on but I ain't afraid
ABC everythang, every M you end up with is owed
And that's simple math, I had to balance the good and bad
No masters but a mastermind, Master Kush up in my bag
Soulo in the backseat, in a thing with some tints on it
With a thing with some tits on her, and every nigga in this bitch own her
Soul!

[Hook - SZA]

[Bridge - SZA:]
These Days, in chains
You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Fuck
My girl died and I lost my mind, I'm off everything except Heroin
Blame God, don't blame her. All I did was take gangsters to church
Got your lady with literature under her Louis bag
Got your kid studying outside of class
Every project that I dropped she bought em, so now she read more than she Red Bottom
Ab-Soul, Abstract, Asshole I'm with the shit
I say cuz around Bloods and I say Blood around Crips, I'm twisted
Got Mary, got Lucy, got Molly, that's wifey, girlfriend and mistress
Ain't no going against me man make another plan, pop a Xan
Forget it
Hahaha, that's how it is These Days
Yeah that's how it goes
Cause we ain't choose this life it chose us, so don't show hate cause she chose us
I'm just stacking paper, get yours up
Lil' nigga finish your chores up
That's my word I got shows booked
Got that Purp I pour fo's up, stole the show this a hold up
Ho-Hol up, Soulo Ho, there is only uno
Puto uh, Top Dawg out of this world pluto on pluto, you know

[Hook - SZA]

[Bridge - SZA:]

You even lose when you win These Days
These Days... God's Reign
Scared to live, scared to live these days

[Outro - Isaiah Rashad:]
God's Reign
These Days...
Yo, y'all got some more trees?


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
(Money is the anthem...)
People treat you real nice when you got fifty dollar drawers on
(Get money, fuck bitches)
I'm tryin' man
(Fuck bitches, get money, get money)

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Who gettin' that dough? Who gettin' that cake?
Who gettin' that bread? Put a ticket on your head if you can't relate
Who gettin' that fetti? Who gettin' that cheese?
You know I gotta eat, you know I gotta eat
Who gettin' that paper? Who gettin' that guap?
Who smokin' that top shelf? Who gettin' top off top?
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Who gettin' them commas, makin' mamas do kama sutra
Best act like you know, I'm gettin' them checks, I'm spendin' them checks
THC through TSA on my back, don't get checked
Who gettin' them Benjamins? Spendin' them with executives
Business man, understand, I'm on fuckin' tour, you on the 10-6, I'm reelin' in
Currency, won't pass the weed but I'll pass the bitch
My stock risin', you cock ridin', I'm splittin' clits where the money clip
Who gettin' that money, money? Real mothafuckin' money, money
Thatâs all I do dawg, got cashed out
Got fucked up, then I passed out

[Hook - Mac Miller:]
Woke up early, kissed this bad bitch
Rolled me up a blunt, then I took a piss
Can't remember what I did last night
I'm just tryin' to spend a hunnid stax everyday of my life
Money is the anthem
Black girls in the bedroom, white girls in the bathroom
Fuck what I did last night
I'm just tryin' to spend a hunnid stax everyday of my life

[Verse 2 - Schoolboy Q:]
Who gettin' that dough? Who gettin' that bread?
Get money I pledge, what you mean you broke bitch, open them legs
Now let a nigga be, I think I'm gonna skeet
You know I love cheese, you know I love cheese
I'm high as a scraper, I'm smokin' that guap
Who leave guns on the top shelf? Who keep Glocks on Glocks?
Ain't nothing more important than a hoover
Who hoppin' out cars, unloadin' that pop, pop, yawk, yawk, move ya'
Fi-Fig- Figueroa, gotta a .45 right here up in my coat
You can have my ho but don't hit my dope
I'm burnin' up like a parliament
I'm 216, I'm suspendin' rent
You a bad bitch, come fuck me
Yeah you heard it right, I said fuck me
Put that on Crip, even ignorance is bliss
I love foreign tits and her clitoris
Beat the pussy down like my nemesis
Make the pussy drip like I slit her wrist, but
Who gettin' that money, money? Real mothafuckin' money, money
Thatâs all I do dawg, got cashed out
Bought a new bitch and a new house like

[Hook - Mac Miller]

[Outro:]
So before we go out, whatâs your address?

[Outro 2 - Puff Daddy:]
What? It ain't no more to it! Soulo eatin' now! Tell 'em Puff said so


[Intro - Ab-Soul & Da$H:]
Have some fun out there
Smells like fucking dope in here
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you
So, do the drugs don't let drugs do you

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Up jumps the Boogie bitch, I boogie board on these instruments
Riding the wave like a lie detector, if I'm lying I'm flying, nah
If I'm lying I'm lying, in dirt, that's a metaphor for dying
Miming like Morpheus foresaw me saving Zion
More fire, that's more fire, that's more fire, that's more
(smoke that weed nigga)
Set that mouse trap, you fuck around, yeah you fuck around and get smoked
Got that loud pack in these Backwoods like summer camp, burn that (roll that weed nigga)
We used to dub cassettes but now we poppin' Percocets
I don't be in no pain, I just like how it feels
I close my eyes and follow beetles in strawberry fields
Munchie munchie, Welch's fruit snacks and Mrs. Fields
Wicked as Aleister Crowley do you niggas know the deal?
(Son, do the drugs don't let the drugs do you)
Psy-Psy-Psychedelic savage and I'm telepathic too
Ask Al Boy and A-Mack about when me and Q did shrooms!
And that one ho was getting grooved in the next room
I flow like, Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind"
That's a colorful touch like homosexual hugs and I try to tell these motherfuckers all of the time (roll that weed nigga)
Don't forget my dash or you'll get left behind! (shake that ass up)
I'm fast, another one bites the dust just at the sight of us
They liking us, to lightening striking over Mount Everest
That ever so, talented establishment
TDE. Jay Rock, K Dot, ScHoolboy, me... Soul
(What up Zay? What Up SZA?)

[Hook:]
When I cross the street I look both ways
Gazelle frames, paparazzi in my face
Niggas talk more than bitches These Days
And the new drugs got a nigga trippy These Days!
Just Have Some Fun (got that Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Some Fun (That Dopamine, I mean dope)
Yeah, let's have some fun
Just Have Fun

[Verse 2:]
I just wanna teach you all about the mind
The power in it, the very power of mine
It makes sense I take interest in the third eye
Due to my lack of sight, I guess it's a sacrifice
Cause I've already envisioned what the world looks like
So when it's handed to me, I won't need to look twice
That's why I read a lot of books, so I got straight A's
Katrina cleared my absences so I could walk the stage
I never paid tuition, but I paid attention
That's why I gotta make it count when they pay admission
Took my third hit of DMT and then I melted in
(Met the devil in God's elbow)
And this is what he said...

[Hook]

[Skit:]
Hi, my name is Jimmy
(Hi Jimmy)
I'm a friend of a rapper
You may, you may, also know me as the white Ab-Soul
I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
I like Denim Jeans
And I'm an alcoholic...


[Kendrick Lamar:]
24/7, 365, motherfucker I'm still right on time
Oh you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horses mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you, my Plan B is to you win your hearts before we win a grammy
These Days ain't shit changed
Different toilet, same shit... and I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has-beens
Had it been for my past tense, I wouldn't be rapping
See these streets made me, broke me down, built me up, drove me crazy
Made me hungry, made you hate me, but fuck love
It don't make dollars it don't make sense nigga
By the way that's DJ Quik nigga
Respect or check it
These Days I'm a little more focused cause y'all cracked the door and I kicked it open,
yellin' get the fuck down or I will shoot
I told you [gunshots] not to motherfuckin' move!
Be another example, I'll take the whole industry hostage if I have to
I'll sabotage this game, a good kid? Yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
I seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
So These Days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothing compared
To hopping out a minivan, with a mini 22 3s and the homie TuTu
Two more YGs
Ain't nobody got time for that!
These Days it's only time for rap!
So Herbert Anthony Stevens, you make or break bread before we break even
Before they broke our records we broke records and wrote pieces, of history
So These Days? These accolades are meant for we
It's only truth that this shit was meant to be
T.D.E

[Ab-Soul & BJ The Chicago Kid:]
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam

Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam
Life's in a Traffic Jam

Life's in a Traffic Jam

[Ab-Soul:]
Shit... what more did you expect? HiiiPower
For the most part, we go hard for the respect
I'm obviously ominous to my competition and if I ain't better than Kendrick than nobody is then!
We shared our life with you, shared our light with you even in the darkest of hours
In hopes that one day, just maybe, one day the world'll be ours
Ha, and now they look up to us like towers for rhyming like we had super powers
They should've never let us in these offices...
Knowing good and God-damn well how well we've been ducking officers
Laughing at the scraps they offered us in the past
And now we toast champagne to the thirst we never had!
I had my ups and downs but I always left right
Rest In Peace Alori Joh...
TopDawg for life!

And oh yeah...
SOUL!

I watch that fire that we have gathered around and see that it burns similar to the fire that is inside you...

Real nigga shit, real nigga shit
Pill popping, peel a nigga shit

Tell me something I don't know
Real nigga shit

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
You know the name, Top Dawg, bitch!
No cat in this, I volunteered for these Hunger Games
I'm the one to blame for fucking up the frame
Of mind of many mimes but might I mind you these are minor things
My aim is to ill instill in the powers that be
The power in me, to move matter with my brain
Powder ain't my name
Money, power, and respect, powder in my

[Hook - Ab-Soul & BJ The Chicago Kid (x3):]

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]
(M-M-Maybach Music)
Three bands on my shades

[Verse 4 - Ab-Soul:]
Something and I pull up and I hop out looking fresh as Zanerobe leather sweats
Fucking bitches in the PH not the PJs (Saudi)
Blow a hundred thousand dollar cheque
Got them goons on deck-
Be quiet, real killers move in silence (they do!)
Them killers they be wyling, them killers they be wyling, yeah
Pop a pill and peel your shit, that's TMI, but that's R and-

[Hook]


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]

That's right make that spooky shit
Yo-y-y-yo-yo look-look
I Ride Slow

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Know not what I do
Lord do you have mercy on my soul? Far as I know I'm a poet or in an apostle
Smoking my dro, smell the aroma on my clothes
Rose from the dirt, so I'm down to Earth
(Oh I know)
You made a few bucks now you feel buck
Your chains gold, my shades all black
I can do this with a blindfold
This ain't rap this is find a mine in your mind blow
Your brains back out of your wave cap, I don't know Tae Bo
But I kick that, you're a Kit-Kat
Life's sweet but, way down the line you're just a snack

[Hook - Earl Sweatshirt & Ab-Soul:]
It gets cold on the road to the riches
(Yeah, I Ride Slow)
The cars and the clothes is expensive
(Yo, I Ride Slow)
These hoes with they nose in my business
(Yeah, I Ride Slow)
Nigga
(Yo, I Ride Slow)
These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil
Yo-yo-yo-yo-yo-yo
Insane in the membrane!

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I Ride Slow, live fast, small time to big cash
Cut corners, cut loose, cut class, fuck school
Had to learn though, the harder way
Pushing pennies but see a three's a 16 in my sport
Figure deal me I'm filthy I know it's greedy out here
I told you that but I made my way through it like Moses did with his staff!
Relax, and try not to step on the crack, that'll break your mothers back
On the surface I will certainly scratch
See Mac? He made this from scratch, just imagine what we could do with a flick of the wrist
Your puppets anyway, let's say I'm playing ventriloquist
Go this a way, go that a way, I'm scatter brain with this shit
What's that a K? Put that away, no weapons formed against, me... shall pass
Remember that? I'm biblical with this shit
The tales from the Crip, on the soul of Sunday schools finna flip
Oh! (blow)
The cameras gone so bring the acid tabs along and let's all gather round and sing my fucking song!
Yo, I Ride Slow...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Danny Brown:]
Check!
I Ride Slow, sparking like exhaust, smite a pyro
A psycho, Xannys in my cup before I pour a fo'
You nacho, mean a nigga put cheese on you
Pulling up no headlights but there's red beams on you
Apostle, smoking on this dope my brain colossal
Helps out the flow to do tricks like a brothel
Roll the lace with Angel Dust and pages of the bible
Survival tactics, target practice if you lacking it get drastic
Caskets If you niggas talking ass backwards
Up shits creek with a tissue paddle, OG Kush make a nigga chest rattle
Call your number like you just won the raffle
Nigga you Snapple sweet come after me it's casualty
Turn you into vegetables as if i dropped the celery
The reality is all you niggas fictitious, smack you
With the hand of satan cause you need some sanitation
Any nigga hating we gon' turn them to a raisin
One nigga, 30 clip, turn your brain into bacon bits
And I ain't saying shit cause I'm coming from Detroit where
I'm coming up short then niggas Ride Slow, AK-ing up your porch
(I Ride Slow!)

(I-I-I Ride)
(I-I-I Ride)

[Interlude - Doeburger:]
Niggas talking about all this lean shit, nigga I been sipping this shit since... been sipping this shit
(I Ride Slow)
Silly out here...
Niggas wanna tell me about 2 cups, nigga I gave this nigga Soul his first 2 cups nigga
I gave cuz his first cup of Lean
What you niggas talking bout?
(I Ride Slow)
Cuz older than me, that's what I be talking about see? fuck it
(I Ride Slow)
(These rhythms of visions of me living colossal, ahead of my time
In time you'll find that I'm a fossil)
Soulo

[Hail Mary melody]
La-la-la-la-la

What do we have here now? Run quick see
Come with me, come with me

Come with me, come with me
(Exhale Mary)
La-la-la-la-la
(I Ride Slow)

[Verse 4 - Ab-Soul:]
I heard they stopped making Actavis...
(You know when I heard that?)
While I was sipping Actavis!
Fast life, slow motion in my double cup
The screw give me drive like a flat-head, every fill up
I must be Captain Phillips
These niggas don't speak my language
Residue on my debit card, don't tell my moms
That it's a lot more than marijuana in her son
I walk on the dark side, only to shed light where they ain't no sun
Deadline Snapback on my mind, I ain't suicidal I'm just fly
My rhymes, Ciroc and Ayahuasca would you like a sip?
Enlightenment from a low life that's more than likely high
What I do with 8 zips nigga? You don't know the half
All these lines add up like a motherfucking graph
Rap as if I had 2 left feet, tryna walk a righteous path
So here's a question that I ask...
What's a negative with no plus?
A Benz with no bus?
A curse with no gift?
Who's God with no us?

[Verse 5 - Delusional Thomas:]
Delusional, murder marsupials when I puke a flow
Put my dick in witches from the Crucible
I'm hard to get a read on, that pussy shaking, Parkinson's Disease on
Pardon me I sneezed, blessing conscious as I speaks freely
Death is cold homie, breathe easy
Loaded gun in front of me
Shoot the soul right out of Soul, yeah you my homie
You do my murder

Ay-ay-ay-ay
Fuck off! Maaaaaan
(I Ride Slow)
(Stop sniffing on that God-Damn bleach is what you need to do)

How dare a man talk about the potency of my pack?
I snort dope, it's mixed with Crystal Meth and gastric bypass
Satan's blood in my flesh
Nobody is high as, and These Days the iPad
Will tell you that your life will be no longer than an eyelash...
And then float away
(I Ride Slow)
So good luck!

[Outro:]

Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-boop-
Fuck yeah!

Better ask somebody!

No, no, don't do you dare, cast one stone in air
I'm cracking stone with bare hands, you're a mere man
I know my stoners here, all my visionaries
Shades in the night, that's a scary sight
I'm never in the dark though, my squad the brightest circle
Watch with the internet alone I enlighten the whole globe
That's iTunes from a nigga with astigmatism
I got it from my moms, thank you Steve Jobs
You took my grandpa job and you gave me a job
Not just a physical but digital way of displaying my rhymes
And making these kind people pay a fine
I've been through a lot, I deserve a lot, this work's fine

[Hook - Ab-Soul:]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
I'm more than a man, I've been died and rose again
Left these holes in my hands, so you know who I am
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata (YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK)
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata
Stigmata, stigmata, stigmata

[Verse 2 - Action Bronson:]
From the fiery pits, on some Dead Poets Society shit
Here to bring you a variety mix
Grab my dick, violently spit, cause I don't give a fuck
About the type of shit, batty boys are on, get your vaginas wet
And you shaking in your ballet shoes
At the restaurant we valet twos, bad news
Half moons on ten goons, uh
On the four wheeler shredding up the sand dunes
There's something wrong and that's quite clear
I smell deception in the night's air
That shit is sweeter than a ripe pear
For your love, I cut my right ear

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Asaad:]
Oh no, no, no they didn't, cause these ain't bars, these prisons
Walk with me, every step I take in these Visvims
Real rare breed, cut from the cloth like
A phoenix feather when I write, Molotov, yikes!
You seen them flowers bloom, know that they grew in despair
A blessing in disguise, nobody knew it was there
My crown had been made, I just had to put it on
Now I spread my wings and let the bird of dawning sing its song
And when my grandpa died I broke down and cried
But still I am more than a man, I am a God
Sweetest is pain amongst all of the thriller things
I been through enough and so I need all of the iller things

[Outro:]
One of these days some simple soul will pick up the Book of God, read it, and will believe it. 
Then the rest of us will be embarrassed


Quiero vivir como los Ã¡rboles
Breathe Easy!
Trees, trees, trees
Soul! 
I just wanna, I just wanna
LT3 shit, nigga, look

I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But I'm about to go on tour
Can't wait for wind, pollination to plant my seeds in the soil
Around '07 TDE Struck oil
It's my turn, Mr. LongTerm of turmoil
I'm holdin' up the terminal takin' flicks
I'm irritated but they're the reason that I'm gettin' rich
Cheese, Give me an upgrade, see
Then I'll be on my way, I'm on my way to NYC
Last time I was there I swear I sold out SOBs
In Times Square with my circle of G's, you nah mean?
Fuck you niggas with your hands out
Suck my third leg while I branch out

[Hook:]
Cause I just wanna live like the trees
Shoot the breeze, stay around some leaves, you nah mean?
But this money got me on the run
And it don't grow on trees, I'm tryna get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Get me some, get me some, some, Get me some
Shit don't grow money on trees, breathe easy!

I got most of you motherfuckers stumped
Rap like I go to church with work in the trunk
Lord forgive me but my pennies turnin' into dubs
I'm losin' my sense, they say I changed up 
And I don't feel no different, I'm still the same nigga
Maybe my brain's bigger, gettin' brains quicker
Used to cop a little deuce
Now I cop a whole case of Actavis to give Sprite stock a boost
Ab-Soul, yeah I'm gettin' loot 
Bitches walkin' bow legged out my dressin' room
Was at the Travelodge but now we at the W
Just to shower, be out in an hour, I got shit to do
Plenty empty Backwood packs in your face
In my backpack more OG than your hood, dang
Hey, can't live without the Benjamins
But I'm interested in Photosynthesis

[Hook]

Me and She sittin' in a tree
K.I.S.S.I.N.G
First comes love, then comes marriage
Fuck that! I'm just tryna get up in your panties
Where the trees, trees, trees
Where the trees, trees, trees, trees
Burn the motherfuckin' trees, trees, trees, trees
With the trees, trees, trees, trees

[Interlude: Joey Bada$$]
It's still World Domination
Keep a Backwood and a motherfuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team
Nigga it's still a World Domination
Keep a Backwood and a motherfuckin' eighth and
Always got the trees, so what the fuck you mean
I ain't about to rise to the top with my fuckin' team

Heaven ain't far Curtiss, it ain't far at all my nigga
Check, Joey I know I told you, quote it in a verse
But we called it the third eye when it could really be the first
Wha gwan Jah no rarseclart me
I took it to heights these parasites can't see
Rarely do I bark, hope you get the analogy
Top Dawg Ent barkin' on the whole industry
Niggas get to bitin', I be like Breathe Easy!
Your cardiovascular isn't fast enough
I'm Canibus smokin' cannabis, sippin' Actavis
Before the Mathers diss I used to work at Magic Disk
With a dollar and a dream, why you think money is green?
Color of vegetation, the most important thing Trees

Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some
Gimme some, gimme some


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
Jinx what up my nigga?
Soulo

I get turnt, I get rowdy
Backwood full of some of the loudest!
I'm fucked up! I get wasted
That's a hundred dollar cup I just wasted!
I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker I'm Twact!
(I get high, she get low)
Motherfucker!

[Verse 1 - Jinx:]
Uh, Twact out till I pass out
If you ain't fucking with the team then you assed outFlow dope like a crack house, bitches pill poppin'
House poppin' like a Frat House
Keep 16s like a verse nigga
Codeine got me leaning in reverse nigga
I popped a Xanny then she dropped her panties
I get the dough and bring it home, to the family
See I ain't fucking with you man if you ain't paying me
I'm from the village baby, I'm just tryna win a Grammy
Uh, smoking Backwoods back-to-back
Double cross the squad and get popped like Cracker Jacks
You see the look in my eyes so you know I'm strapped
A real Compton resident, yeah you know I'm that
I pulled up to the function with the pack
Turnt in this bitch to the max!

[Hook - Doeburger & Jinx:]
My nigga I'm twact (I get high)
Turkey bag full of that gas
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
Styrofoam cups, no glass
Nigga I'm twact (get high)
Got them bars on me, no rap
Nigga I'm twact (she get low)
I don't even know where I'm at
Nigga I'm Twact!

[Verse 2 - Short Dawg:]
I just got home boy I'm glad I made it
The Codeine got me activated
New mix alert, Soul you have to taste it
Know I got the lean on me, like tax evasion
I mixed it with a whole lot of cannabis, mind travelling, getting throwed like a javelin
H Town slang I done poured up a Matt Schaub
Drugs got me like woah I'mma twact raw
And now on a mission just to get some cheeks
If she don't answer when I call, Imma hit delete
I don't love these hoes at all, boy I be with freaks
Cause they know if I fall it's gone be asleep
And I'm back on the road sipping mud again
Tryna stay inside the lines like I'm coloring
The cops say "I seen you swerving, tell me why."
I told em I ain't even gon' lie...

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ab-Soul:]
Soulo ho, well known from Del-Amo to Soho ho
This ain't Arabian night but let me see your camel toe
I might even set up my camera too
Oh, do the splits on the dick like aerobics
Them other niggas talking shit but they don't know shit
No, they ain't on and ain't on shit
Yeah they on that, I'm on this...
And I don't need no necklace cause I be off the chain
And all they say is yes when everybody know your name
Got a pack of Jet fuel that they don't use for planes
Unless it's a metaphor for how high I'm remaining
Seals in the cut like Navy training, along with a couple other things I shouldn't be naming
Eh, Long Hair Don't Care, how come I'm the most faded in here?

[Hook]

[Outro:]
BMB, TDE
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ladi-dadi we likes to party
We might cause trouble, we might body somebody
Ah! Ah!


[Intro - Ab-Soul:]
All my life
All my life

[Bridge - Ab-Soul:]
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was tight
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was sick
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was ill
I say all my life, all my life, all my life I knew I was I'll be here

[Verse - Ab-Soul:]
Everywhere, tell the truth you wouldn't dare
Cross me like the gold you wear
Soulo flow like the solar flare in the open air
So much smoke that I'm comatose, but I still want mo'
TDE generals, she ain't spiritual but she still want Soul
God bless, God body, no fear in nobody, no thing
Can I proceed? Collect all of my proceeds
Don't I flow like I don't bleed? Every cut is just dumb
After me there will be none I told you there is only one (Soul)
Yeah, and I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's sober hopin' so it's 'stood
I'm in Hollywood cause I remember when I had 50 Cent, up In Da Club
All my life I knew I was major, I don't need no major
I don't even write rhymes, I really shouldn't have to sign paper to dominate the
Game yall praise on hand and knee, just waited till it came to me
I just kept it real with yall, keeping it real with me

[Hook - Ab-Soul and JMSN:]
Cause I ain't got no fear, under the atmosphere
Trying to stay high, as long as we down here
Listen closely, see what we bout here
Who really bout that, you'll see when the smoke clears
Cause we really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here! (We really out here!)
We really out here!
(We really out here, yeah yeah yeah!)

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
Uh, and it might not be such a bad idea if I never went home again
Fuck the same hoes again, bumpin' "Druggies Wit Hoes Again" with my bros again
No, I want the world chico and everything in it
Every beverage with Codeine in it
How the fuck you say I sold my spirit?
I'm still taking blows at the Senate
Claims of Illuminati, I'm just tryna Illuminate
Praise to the most high, God, Jah, Allah, Yahweh
Selassie eye and I'm proud to say, I never need a 9 by my waist
Niggass still respect my gangster, celestials respect my space
And I just might be in your hood
Causin' havoc with my bros, and instill all to the good
Horse and carriage when I roll, it's over ho, it's over stud
I was overlooked, I went overboard now I'm overbooked
Ab-Soul-Lute just, my life is like an open book
Read between the lines nigga
I did this shit legally blind nigga
Yeah, Soulo ho, Carson arson with Del Amo (Knock Knock!)
Tell your folks I said hello, I ain't never scared

[Hook - Ab-Soul and JMSN]
[Bridge - Ab-Soul]

[Break - Ab-Soul (Interview):]
These days, at this point in my life, I kinda really wanna use music to help people get through their days instead of just staying in the dumps, just keep going. Bring light to the situation, maybe, you know, try to find your own personal message in that incident, that experience and try to move forward

[Battle Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Y'all got me, everything good, y'all can hear me?
Before we start, lemme just say this, lemme just say this
I'm dating you Day
Wait, wait, pause
No gay shit
What's the difference between a date and a day anyway Day?
A date is a day that's marked
I'm smart, and just cause I know you love 'em so much
I came with name flips for days, tailored just for Day
I'm expecting Day to base his verse on data based on turds
My database said Day the basehead that date a basehead
Is he dope? No
Who gave Day the base, ball is what we do best
Flock his projects, that's a home run, Day
The baseball is what we do best
Carpe diem, that's how you say seize the day in French
I stand behind these bars for the rest of my life
I will never see the light of day again
Now witnessing this rare occasion I bear fruits of my labor this grape is green
I gotta eat on the go Day
I hope they told you that everything that Soul say don't go a long way
Don't go a long way, what?
A ho in Chipotle, no
This is food for thought, from a dog on top
We been nuts
There was a fool who thought we was new to this
But who knew this would end up, a glow stick and a uterus
That's light in a box
And that's light, that's light
But light like to lick twat a lot so that's right
That's what y'all call street?
No tales from the Crip this evening, he slip
Seems he forgot what the C meant
It's your dumbass fault that last part was so concrete
But I guess you'd have to be Ken to get that bar b, pardon me
I bet right about now you feelin' like Jordan down in the Jordan Downs
In fact it's crazy that you even play ball to clear your thoughts before raw backwards
And that's cool, but for this round, save the bull before you let the Jordan downs and Jordan down
Now, as for the crew
Well, uhh, the villain been itchin' to skin a dog
And this nigga bought, what, a hundred and three dalmatians?
It's safe to say your mob of dots won't make it
And I'm a fan first
But it won't take too many seconds to leave you in a damn urn
You deserve this disservice
I put this man in ERs if he don't got no manners, man word
I'm expectin' some etiquette in your segment kid
I brought you to the 'Stu to show how we do
So all them antics and funny shit you do for the cameras don't get aired here
They can't see you
Wave your title to this tidal wave, we do
And you don't appear to be a peer to me, forreal
You should kneel to me or somethin'
Fuck it, to keep it 100
You're nil to me, that's nothing
Heard they been raisin' raisins down on Grape Street, that's crazy right?
That's what happens when you expose them grapes to too much daylight
So your chances of standin'
Much smaller than my plan to defeat you
Wait, what, do I gotta put it in photosynthesis or somethin', son?
Shed some light on Day?
'Til he's cropped out
No not now, I won't need a plant to defeat you
The sequel, this movie, won't need to be continued
You finally encountered somethin' you can't counter, coward
You're counterfeit
You ain't gotta be in a Walgreen's pharmacy
To see quill drug over the counter
After your mother consumed you, you were the fruit of the womb
After you were born, I'm sure you wore Fruit of the Loom
Now I'm tryna figure out, is you from Grape Street, Crip?
Or just another fruit in this room?
It's crucial, you choose, I'm sure you don't want me to assume
I should be against the law to run into
Cause we all know in LA I'm double you, all so true
Today is the day I split Day in two
What the fuck has battle rap turned Day into?
Are you from Gotham or from Watts?, Are you Batman, Spawn, or Davon?
Did you really think "Paul Walker" was a dope song?
If so, you were wrong
Hold on, I got one more, and don't lie to me
Do you really have a Batmobile outside, my G?
Don't be so transparent, this nigga's light - through
If you don't know what transparent means, let me enlighten you
If it's transparent, that means that it lets the light through
So I should smack this trans' parents for lettin' light through
Like, he nerve of this cat
Lyin' with a motionless emotion
This nigga Day all bitch
Somebody get Quill a quilt before Quill get kilt
Do Quill got skill at all, homie?
It was some Braveheart shit, all I heard was Nas, homie
Did you really expect to last, Day?
You know Revelations say that we livin' in the last days
I mean, I see you skimmed through Genesis and Timothy but did you get to that page?
You got Gats?
You think your little arm'll get in the way of Armageddon?
Forget it Day, no, really, forget this day
If I had a time machine, I'd go back in time to see
Just how many people would say "Yes" to Day
Nobody, fam, nobody, fam
That's why I'm ahead to day
No, no body fam, that's why I'm a head today
No, nobody fam, that's why I'm ahead of Day
Somebody check the clock, I think I'm ahead a day
Send him to the choppin' block, off with the head of Day
It's only right I be blunt to Lyt
I only gave Lyt a match to light a blunt
I see I should have used the lighter instead
Chill Loc, we ain't smokin' no purple
We need the fire instead
When I think of daylight, I think of shit like
Breakfast, morning, birds singin', kids playin'
See where I'm goin'?
That means you better break fast, or I'll have your family mournin''
When that bird sings, kid, I ain't playin' and you know it
But you know what?
(Hold on, hold on, let me get you right, we have this shit)
Take this 500 before you clap this shit up
Say this, let me say this, let me just say this
These flashin' lights got Lyt flashin', nigga, for the glory
You're Buzz Lightyears from here, Quill, and you tellin' toy stories
You boys bore me, that's why I'm hoggin' all lanes
All your bars HÃ¤agen-Dazs, that's on everything
Day a dairy queen, Deluxe, Blessed king
Dearly beloved, all first verse, all first verse
You know I brought a hearst for the sausage you brought worst
Dearly beloved, here lies this little light of mine that tried To let it shine
And I hate that we have to
Hear the lies from this little light of mine that tried
To let it shine
But I'm ill, you men ate when I finished Lyt
You get it, Lyt?
That's how you ILL-u-min-ate, and finish Lyt, good night
(Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me get you right
You got that for me?)
Brought you some complimentary TDE ski masks

[Battle Verse 2 - Daylyt:]
Question, you know how many copies The Matrix sold?
It don't matter, The Matrix's old
I double cats, I ask 'em if they seen the glitch
No, no, no
Face it, I got it covered
Prevail, they say the sail was a thread to Hell
The gravitational stitch cause some niggas seem down
They come up with this perfectly clean round
But I hope you not doin' this cause of fear
Of the pen, I'ma prove you pussy within
But I guess it's up to you to risk your career
I retire niggas, I'm the [?], I could OD too
And even the odds some
He thought he could least get a baby victory
But all he got was "Nah, son"
Check this out, he not ready
Either you fight back or I ether you
Thought you could face what I hand you, well this is impeccable
Soon as I took a peek at you, you looked shocked
Peep at you, put everything at stake
Well done, this is beef, right?
Jesus, holy cow, cut the bull, soul before you get meatsliced
I'm from the third, I gotta try you
Guy you play Ryu, lose a Ken in street fight
[?]
You still couldn't see Lyt
Division, I got it covered, I'm so eye lit
Pilot, fly, I be the goblin
We battle for a stack, in fact they had to get a cataract cause I be the problem
But it's useless, use less filler
Excuse this, excuses, but, but, but
These asscheek niggas dead
You said you would fry Day previously
But that's what the last week nigga said
But, but, but, keep cool Joe cause a dog crazy
Get down, we turn niggas vegetable if they don't let us up
He know the heat blowers like Daffy at the casino, nigga you better duck
But I tell them tails we never tuck
We gon' line that ass up
I from the Watts block for decision
My profession is stompin' squares the fuck out
We played hopscotch for a livin'
But that's def, that's just plain old def
It's funny how we're all in here but bro don't listen
Have a seat, picture this, picture this photo
This a Soulo [?], hold up
Is it because he 'bout to get smoked?
Common roll the physics, so exquisite, thought I was in here dolo
No bro, somebody tell Soulo this not a solo mission
The deal closed, SoHo is it
Thought you could fuck with Me Gal? I gotta Cotto split him
Look at your girl dead in her eyes and say "Fuck Dorothy dog"
I'm toto dissin'
But at this moment, everybody in the room should be scared as Hell
As I release bars, they better bail
Objects that I process is parallel
Let's get this aligned
Minus sinus, the stuffy nose flew overhead, it's cold
Redemption, stay still, as I apply Dayquil
Cause you look like you need medical attention, don't mind me
See where mind be is a mine, explosive
Interior is inferior, this is a hobby probably
Y'all see I got the drop on everybody
That's why I reign superior
Whether you like or not, it's Hell for you, ice plate
These blister niggas still can't overshadow a nice Day, remember
You did say you would fry Day
But you don't realize you're on the weak end to the streets
Preacher for they peeps, you asshole
You in the motion to grab toes, you're reachin' for defeat
I tell 'em I got the foreign
Cut the sheep, it's all for the woolish
Game, I play is death, get sword for the hoodish
Actin', it's Tinactin, it's all for the footage
I'm dope, I'm practical, crack to you
I need a lot of space, the galactic crew, the actors knew
You feel it it's Felix, see what the old cat could do
But you got the roots stirred up
Gelatin dropped and slide, this game is stormchasin'
Based on whether you got the drive
Win rounds, destroy their whole city
Will they get toured? Nay, do you realize
I still got a break, brother
When I quake in action, think of Blake and Jackson
Take cover
That's Lyt work, Soul
Cut your lights switch, see how the Lyt works, Soul
I cut the light switch off and your light switch off, Soul
Somebody get this nigga help
I mean, like, Soul, assist him
Get him help, I'm sendin' this nigga out the Solar System
I mean it's simple, Aretha Franklin, you a soul sister
(That's enough, man Imma have to throw one of these masks on, man
Should I finish him off?
Use the mask, Day
I ain't done)
And I told you once, I gotta give 'em the quill
And I gotta give 'em the skill
I be on the tip like I tried to give 'em the bill
New approach, Bull coach, I tried to give 'em the Phil
For Watts, starvin', gotta get us a meal
Bein' modest, this is modern astrology for the real
You can't back up defeat but I try to get up the hill
Cold, rack up the heat but I'm tired of niggas that grill
Chicago in my blood, but I used to be the shyest
Cat form, but now I'm back searchin' for the highest
Platform, see where I come from, it was sirens
Blackboards, eyelids see the violence, what is that for?
44 shoot, they screamin', "Who's that guy?"
Jesus, his face, they screamin', "Who's that god?"
We be on the top, careers gettin' too high
They knew I would get a million dollars, what I do buy
That pink kid in the cup, that Majin Buu fly
Tragic, twin maggots, I grew up too fly
They askin, "Who I?" in front of that triangle black
That's that guy that come with the side kangol hat
We take it back from slangin' packs to the stars mission
Older now, I'm in the Rover but it's not a Mars mission
Settle down, one child, marry, feel like I'm Marge pimpin'
Bitches wanna eat my shorts, feel like I'm Bart Simpson
I feel this a full moon, chocolate, dreams puddin'
They be likin' everything I do, they're teen wolfin'
But you got it, you got it bad
2Pac, [?]
Two watches, that's pocket change
Dude coppin' that clock exchange
Credit good, I'ma pull the card out
Better be hyesterectomy, show 'em how to ball out
Cough, they can show that they're stomach so they fall out
Whip, double roof, dog barkin' in the dog house
And I gotta give 'em the Lyt
My people in the struggle, I gotta give 'em a fight
Ain't no equal piece of puzzle, hope God'll give us the mic
Ain't no sequel to this puzzle, I gotta give us the life
Wow, they say the Bugatti went up in price
Wow, that's a million
I'm done

[Outro:]
Ces jours-ci, je suis trÃ¨s concentrÃ©


[Intro:]
These days I'm so focused
Fast life, slow motion
These, these days I'm so focused
These days I'm so focused
Fast life, slow motion

[Hook - Ab Soul & Nikki Jean:]
Or maybe I'm just a dreamer
And life is but a dream
And I would never leave her
But I bet she can't wait to get rid of me
And I be all night, no sleep, real talk
Go hard until the AM
You can have my shine, I give you my light
Opportunities you take them
And you can take your time on your own time
I be at the finish line waiting
Cause some people chase the world
Other people let the world chase them, yo

[Bridge - Ab Soul (x4):]
We run, we run, we run the world (Get high)
We run, we run, we run this world (Yeah)

[Verse 1 - Ab-Soul:]
Yeah, can you hear it?
I spread love, can you feel it in your spirit?
When doves cry shit get serious
You feel like a prince in a pharaoh's pyramid
Scheme turned dream turned nightmare on Elm Street
Ye ain't got your heart in the right place
How the hell you plan to stay on beat, on beat?
Yeah, I put that on me
I got a gun and a good book, leave all your homies holy, moly
Black sheep, no miss Bo Peep
Motherfuck police âtil they release all of my OGâs
You could lean on me âtil you Morgan Free
You donât need no sleep

[Hook] 
[Bridge]

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco:]
Canât spell Illuminati without Lu canât spell Lu without âuâ
Canât spill blood without blue now ask yourself what is what I do
Let you put that together without glue without screw, fast life
Built a time machine in my past life, a horror story about as long as Fukushima half-life
And mostly Iâll be ghost, and to talk about it have to rhyme into a flashlight
Now thatâs a long way from blackface track that they using for your rat race
Connected to a cat face, you can ask them pussies how a lap taste
Maybe like cookies to a monster
Running miles to the mouths of meows coming out (high plane try not to be bomber)

[Interlude - Nikki Jean:]
Full speed ahead, full speed ahead
To allow no limits, there are no limits
No limits allowed, no limits exist
Cause maybe, cause maybe
There are no limits

[Hook] 
[Bridge]

[Outro - Ab-Soul:]
Go, go, uh
Yeah, no roof on the jeep with a big old chain
Niggas left for the sniff and came back for the base
You could tell he was tripping by the look on his face
No new jacks in my city
Aye, Iâm feeling like G money, money, money
Yeah, uh, Iâm feeling like G money, money, money
Yeah, no new jacks in my city
Bitch, Iâm G money, money, money


[Intro:]
It's 1: 25 baby and guess what we up doing
Get money then you die my nigga
Ain't really that much to it
A lot of people have big plans
I'm just the one that stuck to it
A nigga tryna drive what Baby driving
Shit, I'm tryna do what Puffy doing
I feel like the guy in Crush Groove
My whole life is like Crush Groove

[Verse 1:]
How things been since I left?
I know these niggas now have very little respect
That's why I came back to get you up out that dress
And that was kinda direct but what else would you expect
You can buy cars, big condos and jets
Handguns and techs, you'll never get no respect
She walks in the room kisses me on the neck
Sits down on the couch like I'm tryna have sex
Two months later her stomach it feels upset
Took a pregnancy test shook her head and was yes
Never meant to happen hoping it turns for the best
Whatever the outcome I'm always gone have regrets
I am not Jody you are not no Yvette
'Fore charges get pressed I'm a go head and step
If you getting money niggas gotta connect
And I never smoke stress or wanna fuck w my ex

[Hook:]
It's 1: 25 baby [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Excuse my language but I done been through some shit
One thing I knew is I never was finna quit
Build a foundation it take time to get rich
Instead of can tuna I'm a fuck with this shrimp
Get a nice car hit it off with some tint
And every time I see my girl I hit her off with some rent
I talk to the kids hit em off with some sense
Don't talk to police you might get somebody pinched
Never give a inch life can go in a flinch
Don't day you got a gun when niggas know it's a wrench
Hanging out with me feels like an event
And I hit it one time she said, "Yea, I'm convinced"
I know it's getting late but I ain't feeling content
So I'm a pick this lock till I hear it go click
Tryna get my chips and stay away from you simps
If you happy being you I fuck with you on the strength

[Hook:]
It's 1: 25 baby [x4]

[Outro:]
You know, just living the way I was always meant to
Ain't no coincidence, you work hard, you get what you deserve then you die
The rest is up to you and how you spend it is up to you
Tomorrow ain't promised for none of us
That's why we pop champagne today!


Flow masters, top down
Gold Daytona's, I ride around

(When we in my 5.0)

[Verse:]
Swap Meet, Venice Beach
You looking broke, not me
I'm riding big, I'm shining big
I hit her phone, come by the crib
We in the pool, I slid it in
I slid it in, I slid it in
I take a quick shower then hit again
That fat chocolate ass is like m&m's
I got red hoes, I got yellow bones
This the yellow album, rocking yellow stones
OpM is the new Roc-A-Fella holmes
My niggas in DC be rocking hella foams
I get my grind on, in different time zones
Man, counting all this money got my mind gone
I feel like Derrick Rose, in the rarest clothes
$400 for the jeans, I bought two pair of those
Y'all be sharing hoes, we comparing hoes
I told her start working out; I'm just preparing hoes
For the limelight, get yo mind right
You still buying Louis bags, bitch you all hype
White, Black, Asian, fat, I got all types
As long as they riding we'll be all right

Flow masters, top down
Gold Daytona's, I ride around

(When we in my 5.0)

[Conversations Intro:]
Ok callers, we gone go 'head and open up these phone lines
I need y'all to call in and let me know what y'all wanna hear tonight
If you with somebody, you want me to put something on, we gone do that for you
Right now what we gone do though, I'm a need everybody to call in
If you ain't got nobody we need everybody to describe they perfect person
And what would you say to that perfect person if given a chance
How important is conversation?

[Hook: x2]
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Verse:]
Yo, call Tisha phone
Play this while you sleep so you never really sleep alone
I'm keeping on to the break of dawn
If the pussy tight stopped at the light
Bagged your wife caught her looking twice
She said "yea Dom go head boy you looking right"
Know I got my stripes I could never live a rookie life
Still tryna get up in the nookie plus her cookies nice
She give me private shows and don't have to pay the booking price
Tasha wanna give me 2 mil for the booking rights
If I lived in New York I'd probably be the Brooklyn type
Niggas from the hood don't be acting all shook at night
Tattoo tears and niggas never even took a life
I swear to y'all niggas nowadays don't be looking right
It's girls in the kitchen that don't be cooking right
With so much drama from my old Bm
It's kinda hard being from this fucking OpM
And that's real

[Hook: x2]
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
I need an interview; I'm tryna get down with you
Get down with you, get down with you

[Outro:]
You know what I'm saying? Now look at me
Now look at me you know when I was little I used to hop in my dad's
Back then they would have the little 325's, you know stuff like that, them type of cars
You would hop in and be like man, look at the leather, look at the buttons
This is it, this is living it
That didn't seem that long ago and now it's like
My dad get in my car and man this is like being in a jet


[Verse 1:]
I'm in the game to win somethin'
She didn't wanna roll with me until she seen her friend comin'
Bought the BMW, you know I got the Benz comin'
Broke niggas always in the club but never spend nothin'
These broke hoes always talking 'bout you should spend somethin'
Got my first kiss in '89, yea I been thuggin'
Tryna write a song everyday cause the rent comin'
Kids see my car and they think it's 50 Cent comin'

[Hook:]
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Verse 2:]
Ay, park my car up in the front and keep the shit runnin'
I fuck with you nigga, 100, we can get blunted
Me and my nigga Nip Hussle in the 600
How you gon' win if you never wanna risk nothin'
Get up off yo ass lil' nigga gon' get somethin'
I'm in the dice game, all bets, tryna hit somethin'
These hoes walk around in the club tryna kiss him
Not right now damn can't you see I'm with somethin'
Don't ever mess with sloppy hoes cause you can get somethin'
Niggas up early in the morning tryna get somethin'
If you put in on this weed then you can hit somethin'
Leimert Park nigga, never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Hook:]
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
West side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'
East side niggas never runnin' cause we been thuggin'

[Outro:]
We been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'
Been thuggin'


[Intro: Too $hort]
I know you think I'm lying baby, but I'm really working
I'm up all night in the studio, and I'll be home soon
Ain't no bitches here, it's just the homies baby
"Yeah right"

(You gon get me in trouble, I can't mess with you no more)

[Hook: x2]
Girl we just bonin'
Don't be callin' my phone in the morning
I'm in the studio trying to get focused
I want to hear the song that make the girls bust that open

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She tell me I can stick it to her
I only took one hit, after that I was addicted to it
Sometimes I just like to listen to it
I make her go (baby...) Listen to it
I love it when we take turns
I'll be careful with the wax girl, this might burn
I'm just living good off the money that I earn
Making girls drop it to the floor, and give him thigh burns
I'm pourin' that jamaican rum
Mix it with a splash of coke, I could make you one
Say she got a man that she know I'm fittin' to take her from
And you don't do it good enough if she ain't shaking nuttin'
She told me that she in love
Just like a princess she want to end up (shit)
But I'm just trying to get my wins up
I know you'll probably hate me if I ever hit your friends up

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
When I wasn't famous, I still got a lot of pussy
I know you smoking, but it's not good weed
Right now I'm on all the way on
Bitches fucking up my vibe, calling my phone
They know I only fuck with the best of 'em
Bad bitches keep choosin', shit I get with 'em
I'm a real pimp, but I don't ever wear my hair curly
And I don't ever go to sleep early bitch
It's the middle of the night, I'm still making songs
I got a text "baby when you coming home."
I said "no time soon, but you gon get some good dick when I walk in the room."
My bitch, my rap, my music, my stacks
Hella money with a dime piece, I don't fuck with rats
I only fuck with the bitches that niggas can't get
She think I'm so in love but these bitches ain't shit!

[Hook x2]

(Girl we just bonin') [x6]

[Outro: Too $hort]
It's not always true, but most of time
I'm really in the studio bitch
I know what you thinking
"Fucking with the next bitch"
But I'm 'bout my money baby
We in the studio, up all night
It is what it is, what's my favorite word?


[Verse 1:]
This the thick girl anthem, I be looking handsome
You should tell yo mama, she gon' have a grandson
Niggas think we fucking, tell them we just dancing
I'm a let you touch ig, girl why you keep on asking
Red leather jacket, girl call me Michael Jackson
Five shots later, we call it Johnnie Paxson
Money we be spending and money we be stacking
Gon' put up all these Franklins and we gon' spend these Jacksons

[Hook:]
Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
We like clothes, good food, champagne, entertainment
We don't ever ask for much except trust, women lust
Every time a real nigga call yo phone, pick it up

[Verse 2:]
This that girl where you going, I'm a need a moment
Heard you like it doggy, I just wanna bone it
I don't wanna borrow, I just wanna own it
I see you got yo homegirl, come plug her with the homie
We don't really care about much, live it up
Bank accounts, gold chains, spending bucks in a rush
We ain't never had help, it's just us, it's just us
Every time a real nigga call yo phone, pick it up

Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Gi- girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Girls on stage, making change, make it rain
Gi- girls on stage, making change, make it rain

[Hook]


[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy]
Chromed out Beamers
Gold Alpinas
Chromed out Beamers
Chromed out Beamers, chromed out Beamers

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
She just wanna fuck with me
Cause she know I'm living comfortably
Her homegirl be tryna fuck with me
But she ain't never had no luck with me
Girl I know you're ready for it
But I'm a make you beg me for it
You want me, I already know it
She tell me I can fill that void
I play that Stevie Wonder "Overjoyed"
Cause she be making over-noise
I think I made her blow her voice
That pussy getting over-moist
Call me when you wanna see me
I'm everywhere just come and see me
I rub it like a fucking genie
I said I rub it like a fucking genie
Girl don't fucking tease me
In this game it's too fucking easy
I'm in Compton just bumping Eazy
And these Chucks is so fucking geechi

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
We headed to the top with this
I told her baby give my watch a kiss
You know it ain't no stoppin this
I'm feeling like 2Pac on this
I fight the urge everyday
I wanna bite your curves everyday
You better give this heavy play
Your ass could make the Chevy scrape
Water makes the levees brake
That Rollie with the prezi face
Your body like a eighty-eighty
I said your body like a eighty-eighty

[Bridge: Dom Kennedy]
I'm talking chromed out Beamers
On gold Aplinas
With the chromed out speakers
And the chromed out tweeters
Them chromed out Beamers

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
You know I had that 7 series
Believe it was the 760
All white with the beige guts
Slide for my niggas that were caged up
She know when I'm in stunt mode
Real hoes know when I'm in stunt mode
That Rolex rose gold
Yeah, that Jesus piece hang low
Them boys doing tax fraud
Wanna swipe a young nigga black card
I just bought another black R
She just had to go and tat "R"
Random, but I'm in another tax bracket
Nevermind me, I always fuck her ass backwards
You know we run this rap game
I couldn't run a lap on the track mane
Run the rap game like a trap mane
Fat nigga, fast money, just the facts man
Run the rap game like a trap mane
Fat nigga, fast money, just the facts man

[Hook x2]


[Hook: x8]
Hanging, mobbing, posted up, chillin

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
Man life ain't no fairytale you better learn that very well
If you go to jail it's no calls on the celly-cell
Before me, there was a rapper named Melly mel
After him, it was a rapper named Elly L
My nigga doing 8 years with no baily bail
He won't get to see his daughter till she barely twelve
Cold game, I be pricing them gold rings
I went in for a charm and came back with the whole thing
No games call me by my codename
Clayton Crenshaw then re-runs of soul train
Propane, chop hoes like lo mein
I know some cute thick white girls in Spokane
Hanging, mobbing, posted up, chillin
Dranking, robbing, smoking, or killin
Banging, squabbing, most of 'em children
That's five little niggas in the front of every building

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Muthafucka I be hanging, mobbin
Fingers twisted gang banging, robbin
Stick up at the gas station or two elevens at the liquor store
Ask them Popo bout that gangsta Gibbs bet them niggas know
Serving dope at dope man nights uh
Never trust a bitch that's why I fuck with the lights on
Tryna justify the way I live but it's quite wrong
Headed for the clink, won't sleep a wink 'til this white gone
Swishers to the face in Granny's basement that's the chill spot
Bought a pound from Ray on thirty three now that's the kill spot
So I say we mass up on niggas and go take it all
Got me shaking yay around my way cause that's the way we ball
Serving is a ritual, drug scale digital
Niggas shot the Chevy up and missed me but my homie off in critical
So I guess these niggas get wet cause I ain't finished
I go out to be a straight up menace and I be hanging

[Hook x8]


[Verse 1:]
I grew up sandwiched up
Between my oldest sister and my youngest one, Danica
I didn't have plans for much, just lamping up
And used to confuse nice things with the fancy stuff
I'm a back in the day nigga
I'm a westside Crenshaw official LA nigga
Money still don't make me
You don't wanna see a nigga pull out off safety
Your girl still wanna date me
She wanna hit the mall, I'm here come take me
Tell her just don't rape me
Bust a nut give her dap tell her get home safely

[Chorus:]
Lately, Lately
When I roll up heads turn my tops up
Lately, Lately
Niggas don't really want no problems
Lately we make all the girls strip at the pool party
Summertime, I'm talking bout LA, I'm talking bout lately I'm repping LA
Lately that's what I'm talking bout

[Verse 2:]
I been up but it don't mean much
What's the good in being on when your whole fucking teams stuck
I'm trynna help lift their dreams up
I'm not happy in the playoffs I'm trynna pick some rings up
When life's hard get harder, think big think smarter
Be a boy be a man be a martyr
I used to catch a game with my father
And now I catch planes to Chicago
A nigga felt the pain of the bottem
And now I chalk game up in Harlem
2 gold chains what's the problem
A nigga work hard so I got em
Them Jordans go hard so I got em
That nigga seen mines then he got em
So in us we trust
Hoes down G's up
Spend money Re Up
School days free lunch
Never quit, keep up
You gotta hit the weed once
Sky high reach up
We don't like police much
One nation teach us
God bless peace up

[Chorus:]
Lately, Lately
When I roll up heads turn my tops up
Lately, Lately
Niggas don't really want no problems
Lately we make all the girls strip at the pool party
Summertime, I'm talking bout LA, I'm talking bout lately I'm repping LA
Lately that's what I'm talking bout

(Dom)
Once more time

In us we trust
Hoes down G's up
Spend money Re Up
School days free lunch
Never quit, keep up
You gotta hit the weed once
Sky high reach up
We don't like police much
One nation teach us
God bless peace up

Put your peace up!

[Chorus:]
Lately, Lately
When I roll up heads turn my tops up
Lately, Lately
Niggas don't really want no problems


Yo girl got a cute face,

My car, just push to start it,

Switch lanes on niggas in Chargers,

You don't want no problems,

Niggas know I'm a soldier, 
OPM 'til it's over 
Phone by Motorola,

I got money that's older,

Interviews on the phone 
and living life like a stoner 
You can hit I don't own it,

My car look like a loaner, 
I got hoes in Arizona 
That got a college diploma, 
and my watch got pneumonia 

[Hook]


If ever we get lost during our time, please don't forget me
You are free to take a look around but always remember where you come from
By the way, I left a notebook for you by the door
Please write when you can
Peace & Happiness!

[Hook:]
Peace & Happiness

[Verse 1:]
I used to wonder when my turn would come
Now I wonder if I'll ever w quit
I be buying shit I never had
Cause I was tired of never having shit
And now I'm picking crab with shrimp
And I don't fuck with no average chicks
We eating $400 meals, tell me what you think I average tip
Don't get caught up in extravagence
And you can go from rags to rich
Girl I see you got yo Gucci purse
But you looking like a bag of shit
And I don't gotta ask for shit
I be counting all this cash I get
And shout out to my baby mama
Cause she be paying half the rent
Sometimes I sit back and just think about (Peace & Happiness)

[Verse 2:]
You ttryna get to Heavan much
Niggas can't eat off of 7 bucks
Bet you always expected us
Who scratched the fucking records up
This girl always tryna sex me up
You better always gotta check for us
Cause we tryna get this money fast
On Westside Get The Money ($) Ave
The kids wave when I'm coming past
It's a parade when I'm coming past
I can count a million one in cash
And still I give all I have [x4]


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
On the daily you know what I wear

Say you ball; I'm a just share
Lock you down girl, I'm a do years
Pretty girl with the long hair

Ugly girls stop and they stare
It's too bad, life it ain't fair
Drop it low like you don't care
What you got on, I like ya Nike airs
Buy me some I like a nice pair
Before 21 I could buy beer
Stayed down all of these years
I'm not home you calling me there
Headed to the top follow me there
Met her at her spot she swallowed me there
We the new clique tell all to beware
Niggas look hard I oughta be scared
You niggas look fraud I solemnly swear
To never be a lame shit all of me is player

Honeys and money we getting Honeys and Money
It's funny how life changes we living dangerous
And every week we go to Vegas how can you blame us
Honeys and money honeys and money
Honeys and money we getting honeys and money) [x2]
Who rock crews and make moves with all the mommys
The back of the club slipping moet is where ya find me
The back of the club macking hoes my crews behind me
(Nigga throw yo hands up if you grew up in the 90s)
Mad question asking, blunt passing, music lasting
But I just can't quit
Mad question asking, blunt passing, music lasting
But I just can't quit
Who they attracting with that line, what's yo name, what's yo sign?
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind

Who rock crews and make moves with all the mommys
The back of the club slipping moet is where ya find me

(Nigga throw yo hands up if you grew up in the 90s) [x2]


[Verse 1:]
I'm just exploring
I walk up to the fine girls, say what you doing
Girl, you tryna get with me I like yo taste
I like yo shoes, I like yo shirt, I like yo waist
Let me see what you got in that safe
Uhh, yea, I said I talk to girls who talk to girls
I think I ran across ya girl
I think ya man just lost his girl
Shit I think we been across the world
The money's what we running after
And what you think is coming after
Shit, I heard yo girl say she want a rapper
Man that shit was so dumb, I slapped her
A real nigga and he want his masters
I get girls cause I'm so attractive
I can't fuck if it's no attachment
A night with you could be so relaxing
And you ain't never had thug passion
Girl, you ain't never had thug passion
A night with you could be so relaxing
I lay yo ass because you so elastic
And you ain't never had thug passion
Girl, you ain't never had thug passion
A night with you could be so relaxing
I lay yo ass because you so elastic

[Bridge:]
If that's who you want to be with
Then baby so be it
Never held your heart
'Til you had the freedom to leave or stay
I was never in the way
But sometimes you want it
And you want me to step
Try so hard to fix it, baby

[Verse 2:]
I went from eating cheesy macaroni to paponi
Told her gon' drop it down for me like you owe me
When you see me don't be all on me, you don't know me
You gon' be a star one day, that's what my uncle told me
So I'm tryna make it happen, damn how I end up rappin'
Yea, started making money when we dropped that Legal Trappin'
We be going hard for seven days like Toni Braxton
And she ask me do I love her, nah I just want some satisfaction
Uh tell me what you do when the streets is all you
Pull up to the club a hundred deep this our crew
I just want all the fine girls to fall through
Like I'll take her, her, her, her her, and y'all too
It's true that most west side niggas wear blue
But I done just kicked it right there on Piru
Fucking niggas say man we all about this loot
West side get the money nigga this ain't no fucking group
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
Blue, red and green is the colors I salute
West side get the money nigga this ain't no fucking group


[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
We ball, we drink
Fuck hoes, rock mink
New watch, gold links
She going down, no teeth

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
LA, that's me
You wanna meet somebody, ask me
You wanna see somebody, ask me
Ay, I tell her let's get in the back seat
Yo crew, last week
My niggas, mad deep
My bitch, bad piece
Yo bitch, got bad feet
I pray to God, I never flop
I get a loft, a better spot
Another Rollie, a better watch
I get a plane, and then a yacht
And my haters, let 'em watch
Line 'em up, give 'em shots
Don't save 'em, just let 'em drop
They said I'd never make it to the top
But we ball, take shots
I won another, it don't stop
Ya big mouth, a big Glock
I love you all, fuck the cops

[Bridge: x8]
We ball, bust shots

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Okay, I'm riding through Leimert, my tires in reverse
I'm lost but I know this foreign navigation works
I made a right on King, I seen a couple skirts
I said "bitch get in but dust them sandals off first"
Okay, I'm doing 105 on 105
Witnesses had said they seen a ball of fire
Bitch I'm tryna president at Jive while you talking jive
All these presidents, won't be surprised if one came alive
I only fuck with playas and pimps nigga
You a created player like Sims nigga
My cup be filled up to the brim nigga
Yo bitch fixing her make-up in my rims nigga
You just target practice
Everybody say they seen it but nobody know what happened
What happened yesterday baby girl fix your mood
Cause I don't like my head with some attitude
And I don't like your legs 'less they at the roof
Pedicure toward the ceiling, mollys in the cabinet too
Pop, pop, pop, popping pussy rather casual
Section 80 paid me ho so this is what I had to do
Ball, I ball
Iphone, million dollar missed calls
I hit the bank, withdrawals
I make her plank, with no drawls
Mothafucka I ball

[Outro: Ric Flair]
Just dying for me to go... Woo!

[Verse 1:]
Back when I was 17, I had a notion
That I would see the whole world across the ocean
My dad be workin' hard but he get no promotion
And he there every day, that's devotion
I never had a chance to be in the U.S. Open
I used to collect cans for them U.S. tokens
It's that time of the month? girl, we use that lotion
Before the president was black, shit I wasn't votin'
I used to believe a dollar bill was all I needed
Why you keep lookin' in the mirror if you not conceited?
Don't pack them Air Jordans, boy you not gone need em
On Burnside with my niggas, and them tacos screamin'

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Look how niggas did Ma$e, I cannot believe it

[Verse 2:]
I had the Craig Mack tape with that one single
Lotta niggas back then had one single
Tell her pop that ass trick and I'mma drop some singles
And real niggas fuck with Jodeci, not The Beatles
Lotta women in my phone, cause I'm ridin' chrome
West Side till I'm gone, Ima die alone
Never runnin' out of strong, I might buy a zone
Have her comin' home blown, smell like my cologne
Who you talkin' to nigga?, better watch yo tone
She used to call me every day, 'til you blocked my phone
I used to dream one day that I would shop in Rome
That ain't the life for me nigga, the block is home
Now I'm back with my people and I'm never leavin'
Don't do it for yo' self kid, it's better reasons
It get lonely at the top and its hella freezin'
I was here in '92 when it all fell to pieces

[Hook]
If I told you what I saw, you would not believe it
If I showed you how I ball, you would not believe it
If I told you what I make, you would not believe it
Shit we used to dub tapes, I cannot believe it

I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it
I cannot believe it

[Outro: Female Radio Host]
Latest news off the street. The OPM Boys made it to first
But the inside word is the odds have stacked against them
Be careful out there boys, real careful


[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
The girls all cling to me
After she took a shower I let her wear my Supreme hoodie
I'm fully paid, got a young face when I'm fully shaved (oh, oh, oh)
I like Griffey, my dad favorite would be Willie Mays
You get in the game be true to it
They say that I got a lot of hoes but I was used to it
Thinking 'bout her body and what I would do to it (oh, oh, oh)
Looking at the stars, getting head, I call that moonroof
She said "I can't fuck with you Dom cause you too stupid" (oh, oh, oh)
Used to love Death Row and I used to love roofies
Talking 'bout the Westside, right there on Crenshaw (oh, oh, oh)
Back in '93 everybody was from Lench Mob
Girls ain't groupies, most these niggas are (oh, oh, oh)
Stop buying Jordans, save up, you should get a car
Buy you a laptop, buy you a saxophone (oh, oh, oh)
I got a clean bed, me and you can get nasty on
She love it when I talk dirty
It's only 3:30 (oh, oh, oh)
I know you at work but can you come home early?
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
And life's a bitch so I had to pimp it
I went from water with a lemon straight to lavish livin'
Fashion's trend: exchange numbers with the baddest women
I couldn't wear a suit and tie and get a average pension
Cause niggas like me would always have detention (oh, oh, oh)
But niggas like me always had ambitions
Of being free in this cold world (oh, oh, oh)
It's just a couple real niggas left and my homegirls
It's real shit right there (oh, oh, oh)
Watch my old videos, I still sit right there
Ran with my clique right there (oh, oh, oh)
First fist fight, I bust my lip right there
I'm just yo' chick type, yeah (oh, oh, oh)
She probably nod her head like "This my shit right here"
Now, I got my game from the Dogg Pound (oh, oh, oh)
So if she know me, then I probably took them draws down
I got 4 cars now (oh, oh, oh)
I took the 6-4 cause she like they way the car sound
Just me and my bitch (oh, oh, oh)
And all she wanna do is hear me say some fly shit

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Like all the places, we can go
All the things, we can do
When it's just, me and you
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh [x10]


[Intro]
Uhh, Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's funny how hoes be controlling nigga's
It's always money over bitches thought I told you nigga's
Don't never turn fake, stay a soldier nigga
And its an OPM thing, 'til it's over nigga
Lil sag in ya jeans when you fall on scenes
And we grind all winter just to ball all spring
I had the whip sitting clean on them chrome 15's
Said "Dom I never seen, no shit this clean"
We drink Hennessy, w/ apple juice always actin' loose
Sometimes we can play scrabble and drink Snapple juice
But I rather smoke with you baby and then fuuuck
Let me set the camera up, and cut

[Hook]
So much liquor and weed
All my nigga's is G'z
So many women inside (so many of 'em)
Finna have a hell of a night (it's plenty of 'em)
All my nigga's is G'z (all of em)
So much liquor and weed (so much yeah)
So many women inside
We finna have a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
I had on house shoe's
I'm at Poodoh's, smoke sumo
I hate when Pollo Loco be having no more Churro's
Fox news, channel 5, Telemundo
I need me a cute Spanish chick name Lulo
So much liquor and trees
I threw up all on my 3's
I don't wanna drink 'n' drive
Lemme go to sleep in your thighs

[Hook]
So much liquor and weed
All my nigga's is G'z
It's so many women inside
Finna have a hell of a night
All my nigga's is G'z
So much liquor and weed
It's so many women inside
We finna have a hell of a night

[Story]

[Hook to fade]


[Verse 1:]
If I make it to heaven
I hope they're still drinking brew
I hope I get to see Nick
Me and him have a few
Talk about '96
The shit that y'all never knew
When we was stealing Polos
Then wear it up to the school
Hell nah we wasn't broke
We just acted a fool
Shirt tucked into our jeans
We just thought it looked cool
You can say what you want
But that don't make it the truth
When its 91 outside
Bet it's 69 in my coupe
The A/C blowing strong
And we smoking that Ohh
Her homegirl is looking good
Yeah I was scoping that too
But I heard you got her pregnant
Thats whats up when y'all due?
Then somebody knocked on my door
Nick I'm hoping thats you

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
And they don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Niggas know how I do
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Verse 2:]
Yellow Album so good
Niggas thought it was a fluke
Niggas thought I was on the juice
Yeah nigga it was the goose
And the bitches shaking they ass
I'm like, "damn what it do?"
She like, "damn can we fuck?"
Call me up and come through
Watch whatever you want
Champagne in there too
Niggas know what I sip
Tats on both of my wrists
"In Loving memory of hip hop"
I got that in '06
A nigga so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
Most LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
So I could see LA
Neighbors and the Pirus
Fuck with me and get smoked
Or fuck with me and smoke too

[Bridge:]
Niggas know how I do
Bitches know how I do
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
I gotta see LA
And keep an eye on y'all fools
A nigga is so West Coast
You can tell by my clique
You can tell how I dress
You can tell by my whip
The LA niggas I know
Some no longer exist
And they got moms just like me
If I could grant them one wish

[Hook]
But that's a dream deferred
They don't always come true
4 minutes 'til 4
The bus ride after school
If I make it to heaven
I hope it comes with a view
If I make it to heaven...yeah


[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me-

[Verse 1]
My LA show, it had sold well
I went home, no hotels
Phone's off, voicemails
No side hoes, just my homegirl
I be fucking up, calling old girls
We at Supperclub, they popping Spades
In Lamborghinis, still coppin' J's
Still smokin' weed, still rockin' chains
I'm in my Vans, I'm in my stance
I see her look, then do a dance
She see the man, I see the van
I can't go to sleep, I leave for France
Then fly to London, like Peter Pan
You don't need a drink, girl you need a man
Girl you need a plan

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Stay at home, be at Starbucks
Out of all girls, the ones I want
At least 22, so don't card us
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

[Verse 2]
The DC show, it goes well
We on the bus, no hotel
With some fine hoes, don't tell
If you see my girl, don't tell
I love New Orleans, I'm sad when I'm leaving
I fuck with Ohio, It's ladies in Cleveland
Let's go to Detroit, let's shop for some pieces
Let's make it a weekend, get a place at the Seasons
Then wake up in Dallas, I'm checking my balance
Running these laps, eating these salads
Understanding my talent, gaining my balance
Looking for homes, to make it my palace
The best is my average

And when I talk, she ate it up
That's what I thought
Out of all girls, the ones I want
If I couldn't rap, on the job hunt
Out of all girls, the ones I want
Love rap, especially God's Son
Out of all girls, the ones I want
All the girls, that's what I want

[Hook]
Oh baby
Ooh baby
Oh baby
You're driving me crazy (crazy)

Uh, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Yeah, uh


[Hook]
They say they love Hip-Hop? Niggas not speakin' brilliant
Plot my next 2 albums, they gon' make me each a million
I just want the bad hoes, and I wanna reach the children
Take all my royalties and go and buy a Pisa buildin'
I didn't do my homework, still watched Rap City
Seen y'all niggas ride around in them black Bentleys
10 years later I'm like damn how niggas broke?
Then wanna try to hate on me? I'm like nigga "No"

[Verse 1]
Never fall in love with the game, I might hit and go
Just take a nigga to the sto' when my Henn is low
$100 dollar bill dice game yellin' 10 to fo'
Westside, OPM 4 Life, yea y'all niggas know
Gave a lot of music out for free instead of bein' sold
But deep down in my little heart man that shit is gold
Shot my videos with my cousin, man that shit was cold
Niggas couldn't tell me back then I wasn't Big or Hov
Now they make songs with no soul just to bathe in gold
Fuck it I know how the shit go - I paid a 'roll
You need to spend more time rappin' 'stead of makin' clothes
You know I be out in Miami, bunch of naked hoes
This year I might stay home, catch Taste of Soul
Take a girl up to Kenneth Hahn to the Laker stroll
Have a party for all my niggas, who ain't make it home
Cuz hard times in Los Angeles? it'll make you cold
So I can't sign no papers, we ain't in control
I rather be back on Vernon, eatin' Pollo bowls
Real hood specials, 4 dollars and shit
We talkin' all street knowledge, no college and shit

[Hook]

[Outro]


Keep the party going....yeah
A lot of shit, (yeah) a lot of shit about me (yep)

[Hook]
Yeah these niggas talk a lot of shit, a lot of shit about me
Yeah these bitches talk a lot of shit, a lot of shit about me
Yeah they probably say a lot of shit, a lot of shit about me

I was born in August so I'm just gon protect you
He left you in the garbage, he don't even respect you
I didn't go my hardest cause I don't wanna sweat you
I caught her in the Target just walking out the restroom

[Verse 1]
Her hair in a bun, them some nice shoes
Looking like something that a nigga might do
Album finna drop we on that vice too
Them niggas from the H got you on that sprite too
Daytime lights every time I slide through
So how you sign Dom nigga Dom will sign you
Don't do that OPM thought you knew that
J Phresh got some bitches he calling me like where you at?
Tell'em we on the way with bottles, weed, condiments
Altoids fucking red bulls all kind of shit
Might fall asleep on you though no promises
I gotta be up at 6:15 when its time to dip

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I tell her calm down you don't know what you doing
Party every night and yo' life is gon be ruin
Maybe just yo' stockings, got everybody ooohing
Told me turn down for what you know I'm trying to get straight to it
Her hair in a bun yeah thats that steeze
She like Mister C's I'd rather fuck with Micky D's
Cause an hour in a restaurant really ain't my speed
Trying to finish school early wanted to go straight to the league
Heard about the Goyard store thats overseas
With the royal blue wallet I can get you what you need
Don't do that OPM thought you knew that
Circling LAX she texting me like where you at?
Tell her I'm on the way with bags, hugs, chocolates
IPad, couple magazines, all kinda shit
Might fall asleep on you though no promises
Asked me what my real name was told her Dominic

[Hook]


[Hook]
Rollin' up tight reefer sticks, twist with both hands
I'm from the era of freakin' on the floor to the slow jams
Wake up, do a song, smoke, that's the program
So put a nug in, nigga we could smoke both strands

[Verse]
500 horsepower, shhhh on the Interstate
I'm tired of buyin' cars, nigga I'm tryin' to get some real estate
And I'm tired of seein' fuckin' Subway on my dinner plate
Every single night in the booth I'm eatin' dinner late
On the 101, windowns down, let it ventilate
We don't be kissin' in the mouth, I just penetrate
Life is a bitch from day 1 and not a minute late
And niggas be thinkin' Super Bowl, but it's a pennant race

[Bridge]
The honey name was Erica
I met her in America
Only in America
Only in America

[Hook]

[Outro: Letter from Joey Supreme]
I think about goin home all the time
I think about the times that can't be relived in my children's lives
I think about how I much rather be free than here
But I do not resent the calamities which have arrived
Or the disasters that may occur
For perhaps in these unpleasant instancesâ
Something which I do not like may be my salvationâ
And perhaps in something that I may prefer, will be my doom
There's a blessing behind this all
One that a wise man such as myself will not ignore
For I have been given the opportunity to attain the reward for patience
Dom, continue to be good bro
Be there for Chip, don't withhold the knowledge you acquire
Remain steadfast, keep an open mind, don't stop loving love
Don't stop believing in life and yourself
More importantly, keep supplying that dope music

I Love You Bro
Joey Supreme


[Intro]
Let em know we live my nigga say something
(Aye!)
You know what I'm saying

New OPM, all money in type shit
Uh, this might be too expensive for y'all little niggas
Check this out though

[Dom Kennedy]
I'm tryna ball like Jalen Rose
Go gold
Buy a crazy Rolls
Crazy hoes, eye contact and baby chose
I didn't tell her who I was
Nigga, baby knows
Yeah it say Versace, but to me it's just a navy roll
She wanna rip the tag on it
I got dressed, threw on an OPM shirt with my dad on it
Then I hit Crenshaw
Then I ran into Kim
Aww shit!
I might as well call her up and see what's happening
"Do you got a man?"
She said, "Why you asking?"
You really don't care
You niggas is scandalous
Cause I'm from Los Angeles
I know how to handle shit
Don't rap for no panelist
I might mack to a Spanish chick
And come to think of it you're a terrible analyst
To think that niggas wasn't finna get this money
I might pass your girl a joint
Tell her hit this for me
And today's forecast say "Bitch, it's sunny"
And never hate the west side
Nigga we gets money
Yeah, that's whassup
Cause that's the truth
I got four cars
And all of of 'em coupes
Two of 'em black
One of 'em blue
One of 'em white
What's up with some soup?
These niggas is sick
My bitches is thick
My pockets is fat
My name is legit
Like Meechie I'm slick
Like David I'm quick
OPM, til its over
After that it ain't shit

[Hook]
Lyrically, I'm untouchable
Yeah, I'm with your ho
10 toes, blunted
In a 600 Benz
Yeah, y'all niggas don't want it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all niggas don't want it

[Krondon]
Mr. 7-11
Fuck Frank Drebin
The phony police
Not the homie Kevin
Just rolled a 7
Black chevy revvin'
Yeah, I'm riding dirty
Weed and my weapon
Niggas mad cause I'm goin where they ho heading
Slumped on the block not learning your lesson
My prefession
Stay finessing
Fresher than them other rappers
Look how they dressing
Sent your girly to store and rolled another one
For a big bag of ice and some bubble gum
She calling me a nigga cause she wanted one
And you softer than a hundred pack of honey buns
Black Benz, black K, hundred drums
(Damn, honey buns?)
Yeah, nigga honey buns

[Hook]
Lyrically, I'm untouchable
Yeah, I'm with your ho
10 toes, blunted
In a 600 Benz
Yeah, y'all niggas don't want it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all niggas don't want it


[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense

[Verse 1: Skeme]
Look, if you don't know a thing about me know that homie rep
Another nigga cold as me, that shit just don't exist
No experience in acting, but stick to the script
See bitch, my presence be a present, I just got the gift
And don't attach my name to it if it ain't legit
Won't even waste no game on her if she ain't gone strip
Young nigga on a mission, only plot be this
I can melt this Cuban link and make a pot to piss
Westside on mine, I keep them check signs online
Ain't no handouts, that been ran out, so nigga best be on yo' grind
Never struggle with it, never love this business, I don't cuddle with it
If that plane work, it's automatic, back to huddle with it
That ain't fully loaded, ain't no levels, I ain't fucking with it
Tuck and grip, any nigga tripping tell him come and get it
I'm from the land where all the skinny niggas ride
Where we ain't never been touched even though plenty niggas tried

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
If you don't know a thing about me, know I'm taking risks
Started recording in '06 now it's making sense
Why my cousin used to tell me just keep making hits
And now he locked behind the fence and I'm just making chips
I know most you niggas out here is fake as shit
And everybody paid bitch, so you ain't exempt
You niggas still be buying J's before you pay your rent
Meanwhile, I'm out of town with this [?]
In the Biggie Smalls hat with the [?]
I pulled $100, 000 out and told him hate on this
How we always be with Nip but he ain't no crip
I'm just a Westside nigga, so I don't take no shit
Like the fruit of Islam, nigga this ain't no [?]
Don't try to salt a nigga name because it ain't gone stick
You trying to wear a nigga Vans, but they just ain't gone fit
So I went and talked to Quik and he told me this:

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
If it don't make money, it don't make sense


This where the magic happens

This what I'm 'pose to say, forgot what I meant
I'ma buy me a house, so tired of rent
This what I'm 'pose to say: I'm finna be rich
'Bout to buy me a Porsche, hope it come with a bitch
They know me up in Saks Fifth, they know me out on the Ave
This nigga told me that his baby mom in love with me bad
I play that Bobby Brown, LL, Color Me Badd
Man, these little niggas pulled a gun on me, damn
Took my cousin phone, turned off and he ran
A few seconds later I heard "Bam! Bam!"
Shit like that is the norm where I'm at
Niggas ain't got a chance when they born where I'm at
A whole lot of weed is getting torn where I'm at
I talk about hoes cause they be on us like that

Nigga, I say I talk about hoes cause they be on us like that

You say it: We talk about hoes cause they be...

This what I'm 'pose to say, I'm building my brand
I didnât really fuck up, it was part of the plan
This what I'm pose to say: the game finna switch
I'm taking yo spot, it come with yo bitch
I really wish we could have sex again
Three words I really hate ladies, let's be friends
I really wanna to talk to yo sexy friends
Shit, you and Halle Berry girl, y'all must be twins
You won't see this on ESPN
But this shit is finna jam all across the land
I made it out the jungle, now I'm up in Japan
Damn these little niggas can't fuck with my band
Fuck sardines, I ain't touchin' that can
Money feel good when it's up in my hand
Sharing with the fam, shit I stuck to the plan
I fuck with you nigga, but what's up with your man?
Make it to the top? Yes we can
And we can start over girl let's be friends

I told my little boy I try my best for him
And the world is now yours son let's begin

The world is now yours son let's begin
The world is now yours son let's begin
Said the world is now yours son let's begin
Other People Money ho let's be friends
Westside OPM, tell em let's be friends
Live from South Central gettin' it in... tell em let's be friends
Who got some weed, who got some Hen, let's be friends

We back again, back again, back again, let's be friends [9x]


[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
He might have the cars and the clothes, always wear gold
But that nigga ain't nothin like me
He might have a watch and a strap, a nice Cadillac
But that nigga ain't nothin like me
He might have the internet buzz, a plug on the drugs
But that nigga ain't nothin like me
He might get cheque after cheque, but ya panties ain't wet
Cuz that nigga can't do it like me

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
We got bottles but no cups
I'm like Russell Simmons but he don't fly coach much
Niggas went from eating cold cuts to Ruth's Chris
To pulling up in some new shit, they like who this
LA on my hat, that's a known fact
So you already know where I be
And when I get old, I want to have hoes
Like my motherfucking nigga YG
Westside get the money, so you niggas is all talk
My girls looking all good, they asses is all soft
My cars all black, ya ride like a mob boss
But that's not the reason that she taking them drawers off
In fact, I never ask her shit like where you at
Because anywhere she go I'm pretty sure she coming back
Let her find out that all these other niggas wack
And you insecure niggas trying to rap

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Wait nigga hold up
These niggas come to town, start wifing my old sluts
I told her go down ya right to the toe touch
Then reach around for me girl, grab both nuts
Talk about real niggas, I been one
Naw them cars cost 100 and then some
Eating on dim sum, blessed with income
Seen Mustard Benz, shit I might get one
But if you ridin' passenger, I ain't even mad at ya
Two years ago, shit I was in the Acura
On me, this OpM shit spectacular
Had a south central ass nigga out in Africa
In fact, I put the westside on my back
And told her I'm goin' take her everywhere on the map
Throw a big party watch them hoes throw it back
Tell them get home safely that's a wrap

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
And we.. hang on the corner like a lamp post
Mom favorite singer Mr. Vandross
Yeeain't wanna search through my Jansport
"Dom take this rent up to the landlord"
'95 Windsor Hills city champ
Hit over right, got my city stamped
The 439 was my city van
Nigga hella cool, but don't get em amped
Shit, we try to live the best of it
So take what you need and leave the rest of it
Write your goals down, what you expect from it?
Baby on the way, keep them checks coming
Streets real hard, but the test wasn't
Should've went to class with the rest of em
But fuck it, now my name with the best of em
Woo!, he 19 in the Lex thuggin'
Made a right turn on my old street
Niggas outside, chillin' lowkey
It's 12:47 Mr. Police
Fuck it, helicopters get no sleep
Pillow on my head tryna drown it out
You can call me when you're down and out
When the cops come and surround the house
Crenshaw niggas run the town, I'm out

[Hook: Dom Kennedy]
Please make it home safe [x3]
Just make it home safe
Yup [x4]

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Deader than the J's off of August St
Pops drove a turqoise 280 Z
Playing Tracy Chapman, we was watching "Heat"
Shoot out in the alley make it hard to sleep
59th & 5th at my Granny house
Uncle Reggie spilling Schultz on my Granny couch
The lesson was never go the addict route
Ya deal with mines? I probably pull an automatic out
60th & 10th, cable with the chip
12 gauge behind the door'll blast you where you sit
I told them I would do it, talked a lot of shit
Came back home after all the trips
Pillow on their head tryna drown it out
You can still call me if you down and out
When the cops come and surround the house
Crenshaw niggas run the town, I'm out

[Hook]

[Outro]


[Verse 1]
Working all fall, just to ball this summer
You know Hollywood, let me take you under
Some south central love, that's gon make you wonder
Them ghetto girls, you know I love em
I'm not yo husband, no I don't trust him
My Bimmer stock, the Impala's custom
No I don't rush em, no introductions
She knows that me, she like my chucks and
The way I'm strutting, the way I function
She pinch my cheeks, she say I'm her pumpkin
That's what you want, that's what I'm missing
I don't want to be alone for another Christmas

[Hook]
I tried the mall, I tried the club
I had the models, I tried the drugs
South Central love
South Central love

[Verse 2]
I eat at Earlez, then hit the Fox
My hat was low, she seen my watch
I'm in that Sox's, it's from the swap
Oh this my nigga, he from my block
I came on stock, put Leimert on top
I always promised I would give her everything I got
Now she look hot, the money come in knots
And you gon know exactly when we in the spot
When you smell kush, when you hear this
When you see cars, and you do like this
Them ghetto girls, I won't forget
That time yo mom came home and you had me hop the fence

[Hook]


[Intro:]
Yeah
Still callin'
Show me what I showed you

[Chorus:]
You ain't even my girl
Do you just how you like it

Ya'll don't even talk no more
She still callin'
Say, we the topic that they talk about
Still callin'
Me and Annie used to fuck around
She still callin'

[Verse 1:]
Check this out though, uh
I woke up Tuesday to a sexy lip
She made turkey bacon and weed toast

And we been often on ever since
Might take you back to Disneyland, girl I ain't forget
Aye
The player president no failed attemps
Tryna get these girl back to the hotel and shit
And see if we can fix this lil' situation
You know them real nigga conversations
I'm looking at houses up in View Park
Ballin' and rappin' I play two sports
A LA nigga I might go get the Benz out in New Port
So help me figure out what I need you for

[Chorus:]
You ain't even my girl
Do you just how you like it
We can travel around the world
I know he ain't gonn' like it
Me and Annie just to fuck around
She still callin'
Ya'll don't even talk no more
She still callin'
Say, we the topic that they talk about
Still callin'
Me and Annie used to fuck around
She still callin'

[Verse 2:]
Check this out
You can't tell, check the smell
California dreamin'
Some more iTunes money to buy another beamer
Fiendin' for love and alcohol
The life of a Westside nigga with a catalogue
I didn't know you had 'em all
The mixtapes
She say "Dom, boy, you been great"
And I'm a buy the album anyway
You been straight
I be going hard from like Wednesday to Wednesday
It's a lot of chit chat tell me what your friends say
We can go here straight
And I got 4 walls
Might order Pizza Hut you know I'm from the old school
Might see me on the silver screen though with Tom Cruise
Tryin' to kick it with them other niggas is the wrong move

[Chorus:]
You ain't even my girl
Do you just how you like it
We can travel around the world
I know he ain't gonn' like it
Me and Annie just to fuck around
She still callin'
Ya'll don't even talk no more
She still callin'
Say, we the topic that they talk about
Still callin'
Me and Annie used to fuck around
She still callin'

[Bridge:]
Because
Ain't no party like a OPM party
Cause a OPM party don't stop
I said
Ain't no party like a OPM party
Cause a OPM party don't stop
Aye
Yeah
Uh
Leimert Park forever, yeah, TeeFlii

[Chorus:]
You ain't even my girl

We exclusively in the studio
My nigga Casey Veggies, my nigga Roccett
My nigga Tech on the boards
My nigga Archie Davis
Westside, OPM, Other People's Money
Uh

[Verse 1]
I seen a new Porsche today, I'mma get my mom that
Black on black Vans for real, like I'm in combat
I get the same type of girls.. that LeBron snatch
'cept it ain't no guarantees in my contract
True enough... fuck you, I been through enough
Told 'em it was Other People Money, then I threw it up
Makes sense
Sometimes shoppin' is a day spent
I might be off coppin' 'fore I pay rent
Might be on Compton, get my whip washed
Just so I can see her
Just so I can see her do her lip gloss on it
Man, this sound like I shoulda put Rick Ro$$ on it
Niggas buyin' Rolexes with the tick tock on it
Oh, that's what time it is
I'ma let y'all handle minor biz
I must be where you always tried to get
Cuz when I came up, niggas feelings came out
The cars pulled up, and the ceilings came out
The ladies came through and they titties pushed up
And just when she was ready to leave? I pushed up
And told her "hey baby, I'm crazy, but I drive a 650
I'll drive to Vegas if you dip with me
Let's shoot a video in the desert"
She said "you already did that"
I laughed was like "oh shit, how I forget that?"
Make a QuikStop at the store, get some ZigZags
Cold ass bottle of water and some Tic-Tacs
My niggas buyin' 6 packs, not Kit-Kats
Where your homegirl live at? tryna hit that
I had two bottles of Veuv', don't wanna chit chat
This is a world premiere, don't wan' miss that
Didn't have me in yo top 10? still get math
Niggas ain't figured it out? real shit lasts
I could stop rappin' tomorrow and still get ass
Like back high school, in the mornin', we used to skip class
Told her "ooh girl you fine, wit yo thick ass"

Yeah
I said I told her "ooh girl you fine, wit yo thick ass"
Aye

[Verse 2]
I love to watch her when she backin' up
That ass remind me of the baddest truck
A nigga probably took her out once, uh huh, that's wassup
I'll have her at the house, cookin' for me, packin' lunch
My phone never stop ringin', I get faxed a bunch
Niggas playin' video games, yellin' "pass the blunt"
I be in the studio writin', payin' taxes suck
Niggas lettin' bullshit slide, come on, that's enough
Play wit my money? and die, that's some tragic stuff
Grew up on Laker games, I fuck with Rambis tough
Did a show out in Boston, they think Magic sucks
Niggas do spend that money, I be stackin' up
Told her "you could bring your girl, y'all just lappin' up"
Seems like I went from....just pickin' rappin' up
To everybody new favorite rapper like fast as fuck
I'm not the type that's gon' ask for much
I'm not the type that's gon'
Uh uh
Just what's owed to me
A lil' Patron, feel me?
Some bitches that's gon' feel me, some niggas that won't kill me
Niggas is grown feel me, I really don't pop pilly's
I listen to Bob Marley, the wisdom that God give me
Tryna go platinum, just hopin' that y'all hear me
I really don't play ball, but niggas could ball feel me
Uh, ha
Like 50 Cent on y'all niggas
I never heard a fly verse on shit from y'all niggas
So I don't never wanna hear shit from y'all niggas
Man I can't even walk thru the fuckin' mall with her
Uh uh
Cuz she fine with her thick ass
I can pick you up anywhere except 10th Ave
Haha
You need me, not Slimfast
Keep a Dom Kennedy shirt in yo' gym bag
Aye
Girl you fine with yo thick ass
Girl you fine


[Hook]
When I first saw you
I didn't know what to say
I didn't know what to do
Tryna find my way

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'm all on you
I might even be late
But my love is the truth
I cannot be replaced
So let's do what we want
The day might come we can't
I'm always here for you
I can't forget the place

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I wrote this song for you
I hope it finds your taste
I know it's overdue
Just hope it ain't too late
So let's stay up all night
The day might come we can't
I'm always here for you
I won't forget your face

[Hook]

[Outro]
I didn't know what to do
I didn't know what to say
When I first saw you
Just tryna find my way


[Verse:]
I be that nigga always wearing something clean for the groupies
Looking like Caine but nah this is a not a movie
Cell phones up, tell them girls to shoot me
All I hear is "yea bitch that's Dom can u excuse me"
Leimert Park legend, I used to bump that Snoopy
Had some iceberg and I used to want that Coogi
Back in 97 man my uncle wore the Gucci
And he rocked Polo, and he wore the Stussy
I am no marine but these niggas do salute me
Catch me on Peco, I am like the Lucy's
Give it to em raw, I am like the sushi
I hate how rappers use the term "fresh" so loosely
Bad ass nigga, I am like Boosie
But that just might have went over yo head like a kufi
If I was a DJ, I would be Brucey
Or any of them niggas Biggie shouted out on juicy
Sometime I get chose, but u can say I'm choosy
And if u want to keep her then u should not introduce me, 25th hour, that was introducing
Roll with the winners girl cause I ain't into losing
Talking Crenshaw king, that's what we be cruising
Get my point across, so I never have to prove it
Squab with a nigga, I ain't into shootin
This is not the army but them niggas is recruiting
Hardwood floors, but we don't be hooping
When them boxes touch touch down, then we gon' move it
Maybe out to Compton, just like St. Louis
Sugar 16's, nigga watch how I do this yeah I studied this game
I'm a student, but now everyday they call my name and I be truant
UCLA, I'm a bruin
And all them plans you made, I'm a ruin
Your whole rap career, it is ruined
And everybody say "damn Dom you shouldn't do it"
I'm the number one pick, that's Ewing
No one said I would make it, but somehow I always knew it
And I'm running this game, that's stupid
I write like Eric, yeah that's ruthless
These hoes so Ashanti, that's foolish
I'm good on the track, Carl Lewis
All these rap critics always asking for some new shit, tell em go buy it
And they never do shit, I fuck with FutureStreet
But dawg this my new shit, you say I'm bout to really B-L-O-W shit

[Hook:]
In 1997, I wrote my first rhyme, "I wanna marry you" is what I told my first dime
Had my first drink, rolled my first dime, and I knew I was that first nigga for the very first time
[x2]
And said I ain't never left, tell em I ain't never left


[Verse 1:]
Hit me
We started off small from the ground up
Wasn't looking for the fame, but it found us
People ask "Dom what you chasing down?"
Hmm, take nine hundred thousand
And nigga, round up
Ain't never begged in my life
Nigga's hound us
Them boys pressin you? Shit
They always pound us
Ask my man in NY, how I sound brah?
He replied "Shit we know how you get down son"
I recognize a lame nigga when I'm around one
But I look like a clown try'na clown one
A new Coretta Scott King I think I found one
Man I'm through with y'all hoes I think I'll crown one
I been sitting on these bars
You can down one
I been leading the whole time
You been down one
I don't rap about the hood I come down like [gunshots]
Yeah I'm from round one

[Hook:]
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool

[Verse 2:]
I was just telling my moms
When I hear my songs I be feeling like Braun
No Corey Matthews, I be feeling like Sean
Yeah I finally got a job
Is you feelin that Mom?
My Dad asked me why I wasn't signed yet
I said obviously because you never rhymed yet
And my watch say "Nigga it ain't yo time yet"
I ain't have enough time to do Dom yet
But errbody ask my for an estimate
And wanna take my style, look I ain't even perfected it
I ain't even saying I'm a perfectionist
But at least let me pursue it on some Lexus shit
Cause I don't wanna be screwed on some Texas shit
Twenty years later saying I blew it on some reckless shit
The city locked up on some necklace shit
So if you got other plans, you should exit it
The game need niggas that's affectionate
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' checks and shit
Not just a bunch of niggas wantin' sex and shit
Dissin the same niggas that they textin with
I'm textin a nigga girl like yo man suck
Meet me up at Autobahn, tell him get his hands up

[Hook:]
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool

[Verse 3:]
Let me drop some math on em
Nah fuck that let me drop my ash on em
Put em in a room and turn the gas on em
Nobody saw a thing, put a mask on him
He a threat to the public put a task on him
When you going through his pockets put a stash on him
Shoot him one time but don't blast on him
Break a man's soul and put a cast on him
The game so cold so many snake brothers
We can't even realize who really take from us
From "Watermelon Sundae" to "I Hate Summers"
I got big self esteem, but I stay humble
I say Leimert Park was cool
They say Leimert Park was new
Maintainin, bunch of niggas complaining
For my birthday I bought me two Cuban chains and
I try to tell my boys that we more than entertainment
And I'm leaving with a different girl than I came with
And still and all we just this close
Waking up early so we don't miss this boat
I said still and all I'm just this close
I'm stayin up late so I don't miss this boat

And a uhh Leimert Park was cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's cool
I say Leimert Park What's coolark was cool
Leimert Park was cool
Yo

Call me when you home. I'll be there soon.
And I got a couple things I'm tryna fit up in ya room.
Like Wall spread out, flexin ya lil bed out
Turn you sideways, checkin ya lil head out.
Yea. 
I figure before I head out, we practice Merlot and pour us a lil Red out
Roll up, blow us a lil set out.
"Dom, where you at?" is what the text message read out.
Yeah
She catch feelins like football. 
But she bad to the foot, dawg.
So I let her pass like kush y'all.
I really wanna chill, but it's too bad I gotta push. 
Gone.

[Chorus]
I know you don't wanna be alone (I really don't wanna be alone) [2x]

I like toast in the mornin' you need to know that incase you close in the mornin.
Yeah. I might post in the mornin'

Hottest nigga out baby, don't start tannin'

[Chorus 4x]

Uh, this that single

Hit homeruns you nigga be gettin' stridikes.
OG Gucci jacket with the Spizikes

As I light my cloud, tryna get a girl to turn upside down
Do a couple shows then go up 5thou.
they tell sign up, I be like sign down.
Shit I got some CDs I could sign right now
You don't need his, you just got mine.
You don't give head? I ain't got time.
Way out in Sugarland bitches bop Dom
They said that my mission was impossible, I did it like time.
Yeah, should you choose to accept
I won't play games, that will lose your respect.
but when I'm done here I will move to the next. 
So don't say you ain't knew what to expect.
Yuup.

[Chorus 3x]


Want a beat like this
I never thought I could sound street like this
Make top plays of the week like this
And it ain't just rap boy, I speak like this
I eat like this
I'm a get my pockets so deep like this
I'm heavy as a muthafuckin Jeep like this
And I'm comin' in your lane beep beep like this
I'm in your seat like this
This is how rappers get released like this
It's never been the rapping that competes like this
Yellin: Just be cool I come in peace like this!
I got my name like this
EA-Sports, I'm in the game like this
Why you do them strangs' like this
We don't tie Chucks, we let 'em hang like this
Try and buy my own thing like this
Barack couldn't even bring change like this

I'm a die like this
I work my way up to the sky like this
I get by like this
I'm good on the white, I get high like this
I'm so live like this
How have I never been in Vibe like this
I don't know a nigga that can scribe like this
And you ain't probably heard nothing since Tribe like this
Shirt and tie like this
I been going hard since five like this
I'm on the rise like this
I make it so easy to decide like this
Me minus him you divide like this
And we go red carpet you alive like this

I turn her on like this
We be on our six in the morning like this
Another girl scorned like this
Nothing happened to me, I was born like this
Ralph Lauren like this
L.A. had been live, since the Forum like this
I shouldn't be scoring like this
I should run the team Rod Thorn like this
We pop like corn like this
Everything I drop like storms like this
Do not like warm like this
This is me in another form like this
Her skirt gettin' torn like this
We can make our soft porn like this
Her body I adore like this
I'm a tear it up, she can moan like this

In Memory Of
It's been a few months, you remember me love?


Yeah

[Verse 1:]
The very first time I heard run in them Adidas
I never would have thought one day I'd have a fever
They used to say, "Nah Dom. He is not no keeper"
"And yea them songs cool, but naw he ain't got no heaters"
But then I went home (shhh) we ain't we ain't got one neither
The gas shut off man I just go to sleep but
These niggas think they good but I really know they suck
And niggas think they hood but I really know they punks
The man with most isn't always in the front
So hit that West Side and we'll give you what you want
A nice black eye that will go with all them lumps
And I try to stay quiet if it ain't involvin us

[Hook:]
She asked me where I came from
I told her where you headed
Back to LA
I said baby what you reppin'
I got these ideas and I'm tryin to make records
So when the train stops this time I'm a catch it [x5]

[Verse 2:]
The very first time I heard Black Superman
I knew it was ok to just act like who I am
I used to rob stores for a tape I could afford
And I want to thank the Lord for the life of 2Pac Shakur
I know living's hard but you gotta see the light
You never gone make it if you never rolled a dice
Take the first step, that was Doctor King's advice
Goin no days off I'm gone practice every night
I got so many thoughts and I got so much to write
And that right there is the story of my life
Can't sit and complain, naw I'm tryin to get a name
Help feed the kids and I'm tryin to get a chain
My homeboy Iian was the first one with a Range
We used to play my old shit, now I got mo' shit
Just a little somethin' I can get out on the road with
I can get out on the road with
Or may be just walk to the store with

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I remember, no cameras, no calls, no answers
No meetings, no features, no chances
No shows, no fans, no dancin'
Now there's 300 girls yellin "Go Handsome"
I'm warmin up California this is yo candle
And I never had a video on no channel
I saw your name on a sign that said show cancelled
The charm of a college kid with them pro handles
This for niggas stressed out and gotta smoke Camel's
And them ladies with them pretty open toed sandals
I remember them Impalas with them Gold Panels
We still keep it West Side like a old flannel
Mix a little Leimert Park with a cold piano
And tell if you heard somethin realer
I told Arch we was gonna kill em
New everything got me lookin like a dealer
If there's somethin' wrong then I'm lookin in the mirror
Life is a Bitch but I could never fear her
Cause she be lookin good every second that I'm near her
She told me take my time but I really couldn't hear her
Not in it for the ring girl I want to be respected
That's why it took me like 4 years to perfect it
She said you got the type of heart I like to connect with
So when the train stops next time I'm a catch it
Gone


I think this is about that time we ride out again
We gon' hop on this 101, take it to the 110
Wrap it around to the 10
Exit Crenshaw, maybe exit Arlington
Make that right on King
Take it on in to Leimert
Pull up, you know, watch the stars
And just reflect...

Yeah

We the fireworks that light up the city
It's a rare occasion when I bring both chains out
Show 'em what that game 'bout
Welcome to the party, let me cross your little name out
First beat that came in, first hit that came out
I'm the type of guy them R&B girls be singin' 'bout
Tryin' to become a man, and all she think I do is be hangin' out
Time costs money now, and ain't life funny
How I could spill the whole bottle like
"Pshh, it's just some hundreds now,"
We used to be them little niggas, we runnin' now
And any time we see a Polo store, we gotta shut it down
Cleaned up nicely, golf jacket, button down
A belt with 2 G's on it
Let them hoes squeeze on em
I make a girl drop to her knees, then she freeze on 'em
I tell her we like Method & Mary; all she need on 'em
I try to open my heart on these beats, then I bleed on 'em
So when I take the long way home, I don't speed on 'em
A T-Bone Steak, two eggs, a little cheese on 'em
Since a juvenile, I was like "400 Degrees" on 'em
Yeah, yeah, if that ain't cold
My Jordans from '85, homie
If that ain't old
I'm the realest nigga out
Shit, if that ain't bold
And I'm greater then and now
Shit, if that ain't flow
And I'm shining like a king, bitch
If that ain't gold
I think I'm gonna take the long way home
Yo

We taught each other how to hustle, it wasn't handed down
And if you didn't feel me before, you understand it now
I used to didn't ask for much, but I demand it now
It's people relying on my talent, so I can't panic now
I used to love to chase women, but I can't stand it now
Your nigga had a Maserati, but he a mechanic now
And it ain't nothing I can't have on this planet now
All because I took my dreams and I planned 'em out
Then I made a wish, then I man'd it out
Y'all stood in line, I was standing out
I was landin' in, you was wiping out
I was stealing bases, you was striking out
I earned my spot, they hyped you out
They liked your look, then they typed you out
They didn't put you on, they psyched you out
They didn't mic you up, you just got Tyson'd out
So take this home with you
I'll probably sock you out before I do a song with you
I've been killin' shit since "This Where I Belong" with you
And I wrote this on the long way with you
So take this home with you
I know sometimes I make you cry
But I belong with you
And not speakin's the only way I get along with you
And I wrote this on the long way home with you

I do appreciate y'all stopping by tonight
Everything's going good as you can see
As I reach my final destination
I just wanted to
("You know" [repeated x16])
You know, provide y'all a little inspiration
Leimert park is the perfect location
Yeah
And I go by the name Dom Kennedy
Gone

[Verse 1:]
At 7 sharp I watched mom heat our dinners up
I used to wonder why she never eat dinner much
I hit my first dice game on some beginners luck
And ate good all week, meet the winners chump
We was wild in those days, we don't sin as much
Got a lot more going but we don't grin as much
It's still cops and robbers, but we don't pretend as much
All that stimulus money and they don't send as much
Looking for a break but we don't really bend as much
Homes is going up and they don't even lend us much
It's still red and blue and they don't really blending much
Police try to break it up but they don't end it much
Tonight a young man was shot is what it ended up
So don't tell me Swine Flu gone be the end of us
I believe God can see us before he send us up
And I don't know about you but he made men of us
Yea

[Hook:]
This is all on me
From the Westside L-O-V-E (uh ha)
You may never see nothin like me (Naw)
You might never hear nothin like me again (Naw)
I'm back lookin like me again
Tell them niggas it's me again
It's me again [x2]

[Verse 2:]
I used to pray my dad's mom would always stay around
It's long ten years since we laid it down
Sometimes I pass by her buildin on my way through town
If I told her I was rappin it would have made her smile
To see me at 25 it would have made her, "WOW"
Wish I could write the songs then I could have made her now
I once told my pops that I hated school
He gave me 60 bucks a week and I made it through
I knew them books were half truths but I played it cool
Then I planned the future, then I made it move
Now the world goes where I tell it to
I'm just an example, that's what I'm telling you
"From the Westside with Love" is what I'm mailing you
Politicians should be assistin not failing you
So you can go around tryin to tell the truth
Be careful who you tell it to
Yea

[Hook]

[Dom Preaches some advice]
My mind is the strongest muscle in my body, I can make anything happen. Just gotta have a little love and dedication. Give it some time to watch it grow. Hard work can take you anywhere you want to go. If you don't believe in nothing else you can bet on that. Keep your head high and never look back. Know there's only one person that can stop you from getting what you want and that's yourself. You just gotta push yourself to be the best and don't worry about nobody else. Remember there's ain't got nothing to do with yours. You hear me? You Hear Me?

[Verse 1:]
I'm driving down the boulevard of broken dreams, tryna get my money up
Making sure my momma's straight, tryna leave my son enough
I know the Lord protecting me, but I don't keep my gun enough
They used to look down on me, don't look now I'm coming up
I used to wanna run with her, now them hoes is runnin up
You live on crenshaw huh? that just make you one of us
I don't need a lot of beats, I just make sure one enough
The westside is back again when niggas thought we done enough
I rep that david blake cause you'll forever be a legend
O'shea gon' be the first so I'll forever be the second
Who rep leimert park? is something you ain't gotta question
They like Dom grown up better than we expected

[Hook:]
You can sit up on my shoulders I'll always hold you down
I done been from here across from here across the water, but I still rep my town
Nigga I'm still me, nigga I'm still me, nigga I'm still me nigga I'm still me
And I vow to never play you, promise that I'll make you proud

[Verse:]
I'm still the most reliable still the most waited on
Still the most looked over still the most hated on
Power 106 without a manager I made it on
Still seeing girls in your video I dated on
It's still who rollin' with me still got the same
Still eat at earl's grill still got the same whip
Still drinkin' hennessy still got the same bitch
Still got the '22 still got the same
Still love hip-hop still got the same gift
And every time I see her I swear I get the same kiss
Still play that old nas still play that old 'cris
Still play that same jay still got that same lisp
Still sell my own shit still got the same flip
Still my own boss too still got the same split
Still fuck with cartier still got the same clique
Still playing every night still got the same wish
Still sit and reminisce still got the same flicks
Still think about alex still miss my nigga nick
Still ain't a millionaire still never save enough
Still got my fitted on still never gave a fuck
Still know my old shit still wasn't played enough
Still gon' give it back to all the kids when I'm payed enough
I give my james yancey on the raise it up
Welcome to the future though y'all niggas late enough

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
I just wanna go on a date in peace
And there's so many beautiful girls in the world
You can't blame me for taking
A look at you
What would you do
If you were in my shoes
They're only tempting baby
Girl I got you

[Verse 2:]
Darling I'm tryna be persistent
Plottin from a distance
But when I do pursue girl
All you do is keep resisting
But every time the plot thickin you're chicken
I'll probably never be able to get cha
So my motto fuck bitches, get it
See y'all love the way my rhymes give your minds orgasms
But I'm tryna make a couple mo to make mo at it
Increasing my own status
But leave it in the past
Cause we on to bigger things
That you imagine, never had in this life

[Hook:]
You tempt me girl
I'll tempt you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
If you kiss me then I'll kiss you back (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
Gotta do what I gotta do (You're tempting me)
Can't lie baby you're tempting me
You're tempting girl

Can't lie baby you're tempting me

[Verse 3:]
Yeah, I said a party finna break out

We can move it to the back room for the make out
Them knots in your back and whatever else you wanna shake out
Uhh, girl stop playin' with me

The way the whole building get to swaying with me
Sign on my door sayin "No you not stayin with me"
So knock twice if you tryin get right (Ayeee!)

[Hook - Tish Hyman:]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad

[Dom Kennedy:]
Bet they never saw this comin'
Size 5'6" crop top and hip-huggers
Cinnamon Big Red MAC gloss, her lips covered
Couldn't tell you how I felt then, hope this does it
And when we out in public, got you blushin' and all that
Hook my homeboy up wit' ya cousin and all that
We can hop in my third whip and swerve shit, my turn
Aye, how many times you heard this? (You're too bad)
But you don't make me nervous
I take you somewhere phones ain't got service
Grab a twelve-pack, let me nail that
Aye, I can't even smell that
And I can tell that you treat your body well
Gon' give 'em hell, yeah
We pullin' up for real, Benz like Denzel, yep
Watchin' Mo' Better Blues from rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook - Tish Hyman:]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad

[Dom Kennedy:]
Aye, and I never saw this comin'
Runnin' through twelve-pack magnums, them big rubbers
Now she wit' OPM, we can do big numbers
Her old boyfriend realizin' he did love her
I wake up every mornin' same time, like ten-somethin'
Do some push-ups, couple crunches to "Been Thuggin'"
Hit the studio, [lighter flick], and I spend somethin'
Buy a house first, then I'm a go get my wrist flooded
Cause money get niggas in the club, the list doesn't
I only wanna wear my own clothes like Ben Hundreds
And stay in big casinos, navy chinos
All weed, nigga, no premos, haha yeah
Still watchin' Mo' Better Blues
Stay in, order food, white robe, get her nude (Woo)
From rooms with way better views
If we talkin' 'bout for you, then it ain't no better dude, feel me?

[Hook - Tish Hyman:]
You're too bad, baby, I just had to tell you
You're too bad and now I wanna get familiar
You're too bad, oh, gotta get to know ya
You're too bad, yeah, girl, you're too bad


Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

[Hook:]
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me

When I'm gone, gon' fill your glass up wit' Hennessy
This might be the last time you see a G
Might go get me a bodyguard
I might smoke the whole ninety yards
And leave the rest at your gravesite
So I never get stage fright
Wit' all these people comin' out for me
Forgive my words and you look out for me
And on the way home, I, I drove by my old school
I rolled me a tight joint, then popped me a cold boo

Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

[Hook:]
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me
When I'm gone, just remember me

When I'm gone, I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady 'til I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll make you drive faster
In the long run, what does it really matter?
So let that Remy be your remedy
Find a girl half-Philippine, the other half straight nigga
She got ass, then I ain't trippin'
She could be a white girl
Her momma have doubts in me
Her daughter's always at my show
Forget my words and she look out for me
Ha, and on the way home, I, we stopped off at Santa Cruz
I made me some new friends, then popped me a cold boo

Gon' pour this wine in your memory
Yeah, can I smoke this one for Phillip, please?
They say my nigga gone, but I think they lyin', I feel his energy

I might just retire and move to Alhambra
Fuck my old lady, tell her I need to use Viagra
Big nice cars, they'll help you drive faster
But in the long run, what does it really matter? Uh


She keep talkin' 'bout gettin' plastic surgery, I really hope she don't
And I wish I was the type that really enjoyed writin' the notes
Video wit' Quik and Suga Free, but that wasn't no boat
Them yachts out in Newport, tell me, 'Who on your boat?'
While niggas lie about it, my soul girls cry about it
I'm not a member of Black Hippy, but I recognize higher power
You could eat pickles that's sour and sit in L.A. for hours
And you still wouldn't know what it felt like back in '91
And at 3:25, that's when my pops known to drive
Somebody said I should look for a house out in Oceanside
I'm from OPM, baby, got to get that straight
So you know it turn me on, I see her fix my plate
Told her, 'Look at the album cover if you ever miss my face'
I hope I'm on that shit like Eric B. and Rakim, sucker
Her mom said, 'Cut that song, uh, yeah, that is bumpin''
'Bout time you found somebody out here
That's really sayin' somethin'

I think I'm addicted to dippin' down Normandie
This could've been distributed by Priority
Instead we keepin' all the royalties
I stopped wearin' chains cause niggas' shit lookin' foily
And I heard what Chris Brown said, but I dick her down loyally
I have to interrupt, lookin' at your spoiled butt
Only raised by women, so you got waist and rhythms
To get my attention through a dashboard
Why you think little teenage boys always crash more?
Lookin' at the new 11s, thinkin' 'bout gettin' cash
Or waitin' on hoes to start shakin' that ass more
I never been the guy in France, but I made movies in my block
L.A. New Era hat and Shawn Stussy
Aw, fuck it, I can't tell y'all shit, except, 'Get to it'
Gangsters used to wear nice shirts and drive big Buicks
Now this nigga on the Internet tryin' to pitch music
Nobody want to hear that shit


[Dom Kennedy:]
Uh, yeah, spring, fall, winter, summer
I been gettin' fly all my life, spring, fall, winter, summer
I been gettin' fly all my life, spring, fall, winter, summer
All my life, spring, fall, winter, summer

[Bonic:]
Ay, look, started in the Benz wagon, BBSs on it
Now a nigga on a jet jet laggin'
And if it's real, it ain't braggin'
We goi' eat, we ain't havin' what you havin'
Fried lobster for a bitch, this is real talk
All my dogs wit' the shits and they still bark
I just want to get money wit' my niggas
And fuck these bad bitches, say, 'Fuck them other niggas'
Like, they ask me how I feel about these hatin' niggas
Told 'em they ain't probably seen me in years
Uh, how you feel about 'em?
How you feel about 'em? How you feel about 'em?
Uh, they ask me how I feel about these bitch-niggas
Told 'em, 'I don't ever see 'em, it's weird'
Uh, how you feel about 'em?
How you feel about 'em? How you feel about 'em?

[Dom Kennedy:]
Uh, I been gettin' fly all my life, spring, fall, winter, summer
I been gettin' fly all my life, spring, fall, winter, summer
Shuttin' down bars all my life, spring, fall, winter, summer
All my life, spring, fall, winter, summer

[Dom Kennedy:]
And you know I don't give a fuck, just don't hold it against me
How fast can we get to Vegas if we do, like, 150?
We livin' like the '80s in 2015
In the mirage wit' a Roley on, type that
And my son like his father, he don't play that shit
West Side get the money, bitch, say that shit
You got one set of keys and one nigga to please
So you could be League, come on, play that shit
Uh, they ask me how I feel about the competition
I ain't seen 'em in years, uh, how you feel about 'em?
How you feel about 'em? How you feel about 'em
Uh, they ask me how I feel about my ex-bitches
When I see 'em, it's weird, uh, how you feel about 'em?
How you feel about 'em? How you feel about 'em?

[Dom Kennedy:]
Uh, I been gettin' fly all my life, I been gettin' fly all my life
I been goin' hard all my life, I been gettin' fly all my life


Can't make no real decision based on emotion
You especially can't make no money
And I'm here to get paid

Sit with my son in the shade, sippin' lemonade
If that's his favorite, I'll buy it
I mix mine with iced tea, I let him try it
If I told you I have fo' million in the bank, I'd be lyin'
If I told you I was broke, you wouldn't believe me, anyways
So it's a good thing I'm not, takin' pictures in the fox
I remember when we used to be in here eatin' Whoppers
Rollin' five homies deep, mall security would stop us
'What ya'll up to? Ay, ya'll ain't shoppin', ya'll ain't workin'
Ya'll just makin' people nervous with them backpacks
Size thirty-eighty jeans, and you got your hat back'
That's another trademark, we was on the fast track
In the midst of growin' up, memories from, like, threesome
Through all the ups and downs
I always felt we was gon' be somethin'
At eighteen months old, through a smile, I see teeth comin'
Now all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook:]
Good thing it don't take much to make that
It's a good thing it don't take much to make that
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

Just another Friday in the studio
Truck ain't ready yet, just got the text from Julio
Rydell Chevrolet in Northridge, yes, I did
'Aren't you Dom Kennedy?' 'Yeah, yes, I is'
And I might have never blew the charts out
But girls still rock my T-shirt with they hearts out
Ay, and you know what I mean, player
250 a pop, them A.P.C. jeans, player
Uh, I be shoppin', I ain't frontin'
I could buy you what you wanted with my backpack
Let me get my notepad, a pencil, or a pen
Leave me in the studio
I guarantee when you come in I'll be finished
Cause I probably got a ticket fuckin' parkin'
Hate quiet neighborhoods, I'm used to hearin' dogs barkin'
Kids runnin', now formula is no longer the formula
Cause all he wanna drink is lemonade

[Hook:]
Good thing it don't take much to make that
It's a good thing it don't take much to make that
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon

Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze
Water, sugar, lemon, squeeze, water, sugar, lemon


Fuck goin' on?

Ay, new day, same shit
When I'm down to a zip and my money don't flip
I'm hot, ay, but I tell you what I'm not

I ain't no quitter, motherfucker
Laugh now, but I want you to remember, motherfucker
I had a lot of diamonds dropped in that motherfucker
Two lobster tails, that's for dinner, motherfucker

What the fuck is goin' on wit' this rap shit?
Look real funny, keep it real, do I chase the money?
Flows and shows turned into hoes and Os
A thousand dollars a day just on food and clothes

And I had a application for the TSA
Now they say, 'Yeah, Dom K., he L.A.'
You could check my background and see the highlights
Twenty stories up, baby, get your mind right
I'm gettin' head on site, you just a bitter motherfucker
When the light hit, it look like Jigga, motherfucker
I'm from the West Coast where they hit up motherfuckers
Got me in the rap game gettin' rid of motherfuckers
What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Ay, what the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Look, do these niggas want beef, do these niggas want peace?
All Eyez On Me, they tryin' to get a motherfucker
Gettin' head while I drive, don't hit a motherfucker

Got three joints rolled, weed good
All the tickets sold, we good
Been rappin' ten years and you broke
Can't even buy a house in the hood, motherfucker

And I got my son, momma, in the CLA
Now they say, 'Yeah, Dom K., he L.A.'
You could check the highlights and see how we do it
Nike tracksuit, make them hoes jog to us
I'm gettin' head on sight, you just a bitter motherfucker
Walk across the street and get wit' a motherfucker
I'm from the West Coast where they hit up motherfuckers
Got me in the rap game gettin' rid of motherfuckers
What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Feel me? What the fuck is goin' on with this rap shit?
Ay, do these niggas want beef, do these niggas want peace?
All Eyez On Me, they tryin' to get a motherfucker
Gettin' head while I drive, don't hit a motherfucker

'Til it's over, this OP 'til it's over
OPM 'til it's over, it's OPM 'til it's over


[On My Hometown]

What's up? What's up? What's up?

Do it like this if you from my hometown
That nigga AED, yeah, he from my hometown
Never got lost, never got found
I was in here the whole time wit' my nigga Jay Pound

That nigga Boogie, yeah, he from my hometown
My big homie Lance, yeah, he from my hometown
He was the first one to say Leimert Park on the track
Like, 'Little homie, kick back, let me show you how to get down'

And you know how I like to do when I'm off the kush though
Might skip car next year and get a fresh boat
You know, they got spots on the water on the West Coast
Cut off the khakis, made shorts, did the dress code
He could take you around the world, put your name on the map
I could take you out to the beach, let you sit in my lap
If I take you out to eat, it might be a drive-through
Lookin' out my sideview, don't scrape the curb
I just got 'em repainted, damn, that's my worst
You want to roll around wit' me and blow lots of herb?

It's how we do it in my hometown
You talkin' crazy in them rap songs, you need to slow down
It's on my hometown, it's on my hometown
Yo, that nigga BH, yeah, he from my hometown
Shout-out my nigga Tre, man, he from my hometown

Yo, I told her she was pretty, then I got laid
Rep for the city, then I got paid
Went global, had three girls on me like Toto
IPhone, got a Gucci case on her Boost Mobile
Fuck your feelings, we tryin' to get these millions
Ain't shit sweet, my cavity need fillin'
Don't catch no feelings nor tract infections
Seen her fat ass in 'em shorts, damn, I had to press it
Lookin' like Jet magazine in this motherfucker
Hope I don't get arrested for doin' 85, goin' straight up La Brea
Told her, 'Fuck wit' OPM', girl, them niggas is players
For real, we might blow the whole pound
Damn, where y'all at? World On Wheels closed down

Damn, damn, that nigga J Phresh, yeah, he from my hometown
Shout-out to DJ Quest, man, he from my hometown
Yo, you know the homie Mizzle, man, he from my hometown
The homegirl Gizzle, man, she from my hometown, yeah

[Nobody Else]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Told lil' mama, 'Go to work', you don't even know you blessed
Fell back at Sam's the other night, my vice could've been cigarettes
Met a cute girl the other night, you know, nice ass, nice breasts
Called up to your job twice, I was wit' a girl we met
Had to start takin' my advice
So I don't change nothin' but a cheque
Even though it's B, you're overrated
That's why I keep the Virgin Mary on my neck
Uh, cause I don't trust nothin' else
OPM, besides that I don't fuck wit' nothin' else
I don't trust nothin' else
OPM, besides that I don't fuck wit' nothin' else
I don't trust nothin' else
OPM had my back when I ain't had nobody else


It's still in rotation, it's still in rotation
I ain't even had a vacation, you know?
It looks like it's us against everybody else now
It don't matter though cause its OPM time now
And I got somethin' I've been wantin' to play for you
I got this, this new Dom Kennedy
And he gon' let y'all know whats been goin' on

'But your last shit dropped in October
And, damn, it's almost January'
Another year in the City of Angels
And I been here the whole time bossed up
Spendin' money on my own campaign, flossed, what?
If they don't know a diamond when they see it, so be it
Tryin' to obtain things people said we couldn't have
Places we couldn't go, now it's all in the past
I just want to keep bein' me and stay authentic
Love, I get a lot from us
So I'm stayin' up every night just to make me happy
Cause if I'm mad, then that make her upset
And that's how I know that she's the one, exactly

[Hook:]
And if I meet her today or I know her and it happens
Guess it's true, she's the one, exactly
And if I meet her tomorrow while I'm posted in the club
Wit' a bottle to the neck, come holler at me
Come holler at me, come holler at me, come holler at me

I'm for real this time, I'm 'bout to change numbers
I kept gettin' calls from some random shit this summer
It's lookin' like, 'Why you think about it?'
You ain't even have to wonder who is gon' be on top
She ridin' me all slow
Talkin' 'bout, 'Them boys been bitin' you on the low'
They like what you about and the city your represent
I said, 'I do too, so let me just do my shit'
If she nice, then she somewhere on my list
Man, I think she Ben Charles
Got a stand-up every night just to make me happy
Cause if I come home late and that make her upset
Then that means she ain't the one, exactly

[Hook:]
And if I meet her today or I know her and it happens
Guess it's true, she's the one, exactly
And if I meet her tomorrow while I'm posted in the club
Wit' a bottle to the neck, come holler at me
Come holler at me, come holler at me, come holler at me

Somethin', I could just hold your waist while we two-step
There's so many sad songs in the world today
Just a little motivation, a little motivation

[Hook x2:]
And if I meet her today or I know her and it happens
Guess it's true, she's the one, exactly
And if I meet her tomorrow while I'm posted in the club
Wit' a bottle to the neck, come holler at me
Come holler at me, come holler at me, come holler at me

Posted in the club


Where you at, J Poundz?

I had passed on this beat when I first heard it
Now its murdered like the Inc., Irv Gotti never rode a Ducati
And if you pull up on me, do it fast make it sloppy
Told her both my parents black, but you can still call me papi

Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that

Ooh, this was always plan A, let me know what you tryin' to be
I'm the one they tryin' to see, give these girls all kind of D
Dope Dom and a Dollar Menu, I'll continue
Sold a thousand walk-up tickets in Diego, switch the venue
Rest in peace Tony Gwynn, I just see the field different
Had to flood the whole bracelet, man, this shit just feel different
My brother Larry told me, 'Yes', he comin' out to rep that West
Made it back to the hotel to wash my face and catch my breath
Another night at Mama Shelter watchin' movies by myself
Or I could go downstairs, find a cutie and get some help
I be saggin' on stage, damn, I should have just wore my belt
Tryin' to put them ice cubes on your leg and make it melt

Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that

Do your thing, girl, go on, represent
Go on, represent, go on, go on represent
Told her, 'Do your thing girl', go on, represent
Go on, go on, represent, go on represent, ooh

Her Instagram blocked, it's feelin' like she not it
No matter what kind of car I'm in, I'm lookin' like the top pic
She told me, 'Let's go to the bridge, Dom, I want to watch this'
So I drove to pick her up the other day, she wasn't ready
Walkin' up to her room, only us, not a sound
Wrapped in a green towel, wipin' lotion all around
I used the whole bottle messin' with you, better know it
Lay down, I'll pour it, after that you better throw it

Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that
Ooh, I like that, ooh, I like that
Yeah, I like that, ooh, I like that

Go Ares, it's your birthday, all the Libras, it's your birthday
Go Taurus, it's your birthday, all them Cancers, It's your birthday
I said, 'Go Leos, it's your birthday'
All them Scorpios, it's your birthday
Go Pisces, it's your birthday, all them Virgos, it's your birthday
Go Aquarius, it's your birthday, all the Geminis, it's your birthday
Hey, Sagittarius, it's your birthday
All the Capricorn, it's your birthday, ooh


[Hook:]
Things change when you grow up
Now everybody want to show up
Talkin' 'bout, 'I knew that you would blow up'
When I was young, my favorite song was 
'Get money, get money' Weight of the world on my shoulder
But I'm still gettin' colder, so keep it real

Like, on a comedy about who run rap
Cause L.A. is on top now and who run that?
I've been all facts, I base my shit off that
But for sixty-five grand, y'all could switch my hat
To the Seahawks cause I'm always down for the money
And niggas always talkin' 'bout me when they strugglin'
I guess that's why my champagne always bubblin'
Two girls in the indoor pool out in London
At Dizzee Rascal flat, they sent my ass some cash
But all he do is rap, you want to hang out and relax?
Go shoppin' in Saks, hella bags in the back
And when I see her again, motherfucker, she next
I don't talk to her everyday, but we text
And when I throw that Biggie on, she don't even trip
I asked her to roll a joint and she don't even flinch
Dom K. is a pimp, you don't even need the blimp
I know you could tell I'm nasty, though my lyrics is classy
I'm not really that flashy, but I do like shrimp
Wit' some lemon butter sauce and a cold white Zinf
Somebody to talk to and share a view like this
Cause I been rollin' fashions, at least them attraction
Got dressed up for me, I do appreciate that, woah

[Hook:]

When I was young, my favorite song was 
'Get money, get money' Weight of the world on my shoulder
But I'm still gettin' colder, so keep it real


And all they know
Could tell his VS by how the chain glow
Or how the Range roll
It's a man's world and it's all about money

And who am I to interfere?
When that new Benz drive, foo', I'm tryin' to change years
See how you changed tears
Grandmama never thought we'd be as hot as we is
I'm rappin' for the kids, eatin' lima bean and ribs
Cleanin' off my rims, man, I used to dream big
And now I'm the focal point
Me and Krondon show in Poland at a local joint
Tryin' to get my lettuce fixed, my credit "Fuck y'all"
I'm just gettin' the rust off, she lickin' my nuts off
My R. Kelly T-shirt, I think that it rubbed off
We eatin' that Roscoe's, what's up wit' the hot sauce?
You lookin' like you got somethin' in that big-ass purse
Your daddy got you that
Would you run up in this bank though wit' a stockin' cap
Anybody move, guns up, then cock it back?
That's the decision some men got to make to feed they families
I'm not tellin' you this story to win a Grammy
I'm just sayin' you should consider that
Next time you're in L.A. wit' your jewelry on like it's Miami
Feel me? So did I make myself clear?
Cryin' to my mum to buy me a new pair
Now I need enough to last ninety-two years
I got ninety-nine problems, but cars ain't toppin' them
I'm just like my uncle, I just can't stop coppin' 'em
I could be president, but I ain't that popular

Uh, I don't know what's stoppin' you
Too bitches kissin', rubbin' each other
I'm just layin' back watchin' 'em
OPM, bitch, let it rain like the Doppler
No matter the weather we put shit together, yeah
Bring me closer though


[Hook:]
I'm going two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me
Two miles a hour so everybody sees me

[Dom Kennedy:]
Rollin in this caddy ho looking like yo daddy ho
Say you from the wood but I know you from the valley though
Always got yo hand out man you know these cali hoes
My life is a video but you ain't got no cameo
Call me the banana boat let me see your cantaloupe
Don't invite your homegirls them hoes look like antelopes
She want me to ram her though, right on the pia-a-no
I was like a-ah no, Fuck am I D'angelo?
Yes I a-a-am a pro, and I seen your bitch before
And she told me this before, Yes I a-am a ho
And I want to leave you but you just won't let me g-go
She want me to change her life, I got her a change of clothes
Million dollars ain't a lot, niggas just be aiming low

Smokin great
Working hard

Skypin' hoes
Chattin' hoes

Aiming hoes
Feeling's unexplainable, You know I hit things to go

[Big K.R.I.T:]
I'm talkin Slow downed, Screwed up, in a old school with a low tint
Bad broad, love to fuck, with her head down and her ass bent
No money spent, cruise the scene, put on game to pursue a dream
Don't be fraternizing with these lame niggas, You need a king well I'm Akeem
Earth stood still when I dropped my top and I step my foot out the door
See the wonderful smell, and compliments on a pimp
And you wonder just how she chose
See I wasn't just riding high I was sittin' sky high I don't walk on feet, I soar
Y'all speedin' to fast with ya foot on the gas and 2 miles per hour on these hoes
Go 2 miles per hour and I roll, in an old school drop top
And keep the bass on bump jabbawockee in the trunk, my shit done pop locked
And I ain't trippin' on yours shawty don't get no burn if the broad ain't top notch
I'm above the rim with my chrome spinnin', yo clique just boxed out, I'm goin

[Dom Kennedy:]
I'm mixin' apple juice and XO
That's the type of shit we be drinking on the West Coast
I stay open when the rest closed
I got the most game never said I had the best flows
Uh a real nigga and yo ex know
Mad you can't go everywhere that us vets go
When you see me out you just gotta pay respect though
From Benz, truck, coupes, lex-o's
I like shrimp in my pesto, ya girl kinda ugly but she got a nice chest tho
I'm so disrespectual, I'm not no fucking intellectual
I'm trying to get this money so I can get me a boat
And stay away from niggas that be dirty and broke
Cause a nigga like me won't be 30 and broke
And you gone lose your life if you think its a joke
Let that simmer down for you, I'm not nobody that's gone clown for you
I'mma make em put a mound on you, nigga I be all around town on you

Dark shades in the party, ain't worried about nobody
Man that girl know she got it, I might get her nigga watch me
And I ain't just gone pull her, Ima make that girl love me
But this world full of darkness I'm just trynna stay above it
I just need some inspiration, maybe some ventilation
Maybe I should stop racin' the hardest shit that I'm chasin'
Take it slow, slow and you use to letting it go
One thing that I learn is just a bunch of shit I don't know
I'm riding round town and I made a left at the store
Ran into a girl I know, got her new number fasho I said fasho, so
She heard a few of my songs and after that I proceed to run through a few of her thongs
I keep mental philosophies that I learned even at my home
Now I'm gone for the scrilla, mom on the phone let her know that I'll be home in December
Since I can remember I was on the grind so our home wouldn't be so cold in the winter
Till I get a whip with a chick with a grip and zip I can flip and a home I can lend her

Shit, shit, all I can do is me
Few coronas or blue moons and bet I got some weed
Top Dawg fuck a bitch scratch my balls and flee
Eat pills, now fufill your drills be all that you can be
Aw, place this product in ya bra stash, smash
Fuck the police as the lights flash, crash
Got away but shit it caught the dash
Turtle necks and long sleeves because my body tagged
So back to the beats cause I fucked up my lease
Rhymes increase release to the streets heat how you need
A gangsta that's sippin pink, need to see a shrink
Going insane im crazy, going ham in that pussy Miss Piggy
Don't eat it though Veggies, the cycle goes around a regulary, wait
Slide in the path a nigga dont phase me
Dos cuatro siete I keep my nueve

Nigga, when they asked who I was they all knew because it's
Written on my face, hit you when I'm out front
Can I come over?
Can I come over?
So can I come over?
Can I come over?

The game's so real, she got Italian heels
When I look you in your face, tell me how it feel
Don't be on me in the club, girl, you gotta chill
I want that house on the hill, and I ain't got a deal
She know a nigga out here, but she ridin' still
She my main thang, I let her ride the wheel
I been sorta playin', I'mma try for real
Cause if somebody get her, I'mma die for real
I'm the only one that made her cry for real
I let her hit it once and she got high for real
If she hold the gun, she by my side for real
Eleven minus one, yeah she a dime for real
It's all about you, girl, your time is here
Don't let nobody hear, girl, your mama's here
You know I stay fresh like my prom is here
All I heard was "Yeah, bitch, my Dom is here"

[Hook:]
I stay down for you

So can I come over?
Can I come over?

I was almost home when she hit my phone
Soundin' all sad like I did her wrong
Sex was real strong, but we didn't get along
It's been a few months, she say she been alone
Pants was so tight, girl, how'd you fit 'em on
If this was junior high, man, they'd send her home
She the inspiration while I pen this song
She told me to come over, so I went along
I know she probably think I'm just gon' hit and leave
I shouldn't even do it from what he did to me
But it wasn't my fault, girl, it was both of us
I don't wanna talk, just lemme poke somethin'
Now I got her leakin' like her boat comin'
Put your leg up, I think I broke somethin'
Tie ya ass up, I'm trynna rope somethin'
When you finna cum, just lemme know somethin'

[Hook:]
I stay down for you
I never fucked around on you
Nigga, when they asked who I was they all knew because it's

So can I come over?
Can I come over?


[Verse 1:]
Lord forgive me for this watch I bought
I know that shit had cost alot
And I don't really like to floss alot
But I just really feel the time is right
Shit we tryna live that finer life
You know that dolce and gabbana life
Lot of niggas in this club boi
I'm on some "need some new vagina" life
Lord forgive me if I'm losin faith
How many niggas we gon lose today
My nigga caso just got blew away
Sometimes I wanna move away
But you see that I choose to stay
I guess that prove it's safe
This stress shit got me losin' weight
But all I gotta do is pray

[Hook:]
I pray that we gon make it safe
I pray that we gon make this cake
I pray you know that I ain't fake
I pray I see these iron gates
I'm prayin' to my dyin day [x3]
I be prayin' to my dyin day

[Verse 2:]
Lord forgive me if I fornicate
And yea I made some porno tapes
Sometimes I smoke some little Eigth
Sometime I have a little drank
And I ain't got much time to waste
These dreams I'm always tryna chase
Makin money off of rhymes is great
But when I'm out I gotta hide my face
Lord forgive me if I shyed away
I can't hear you when my mind is blank
My mom give me my common grace
And I'm handsome for my daddy face
Now I'm standin in my daddy place
Damn being a dad is great
I get to tell my son look
Don't be out makin yo dad mistakes

[Hook]

Hop over the fence, ain't no tripping cuz they know me
This is what it's like when you graduate to OG

Time keep moving like a record spinning
Step up out the house and I'm representing
I don't just live here, shit, I represent it
That Westside got your girlfriend catching feelings
Don't ask about my last name, it's presidential
You can't talk about a street that you ain't never been to
You always yapping bout them girls you ain't never been through
She call my phone crying, I give her more than tissue
A chance to make a million off these instrumentals
And I deserve the whole thing, look at what we been through
If it was over today, I ain't got no issues
I'll be right back in Leimert to keep it funky with you

You tell on somebody here, they gone cut yo head
Ask me for advice niggas, don't be dumb and scared
The school of hard knocks, don't be unprepared
Soon as you hit junior high, it feel like no one cares
Opportunity might knock, but it'll be no one there
Them boys waiting at the park, but don't you go in there
Them gang injunctions hitting niggas with over 40 years
SWV show, these niggas throwing chairs
That's the type of shit I seen out here
A helicopter every night, can't dream out here
Damn, it feel good to say I did my thing out here, I be

I learned the whole game from the ones that lived it
I was around black men who was running businesses
Making something out of nothing, shit we all physicists
And they tried to buy me out, but we wasn't interested
Y'all do something good and it's so interesting
We do something better and niggas gone mention it
It really don't matter cuz y'all got no benjamins
Remember back in 98, you was so feminine
Now it's a rag in yo pocket, nigga who you mimicking
You gotta pay yo dues first, no dividends
No matter if it's Chucks or some old Timberlands
Sometimes I close my eyes and I start remembering

Murder in the urban town, swear that they can burn it down
Heard that I was working be sure that I deserve the crown
It's what's the world's about, get your money get on out

Now I'm a tell you, but I gotta be brief
The hole of the economy is deep
Deeper than the bottom of creeks
Well fuck you, call me anything but broker stupid

Some bad hoes chilling in swim suits
And they probably down for anything that we in to

Remember Kobe cheated on his, the same ring, we getting rich off sixteens and can't sing
I got fans know who I am in Beijing, I bought my first car off the lot at eighteen
I knew niggas goin' to jail when we was twelve, they used to come back to school like it was hell
I got my style back in them days if you can tell, Things didn't always look bright but we prevailed
We used to roll a regular joint that we would sell, if you got a couple of sales that's clientele
Ain't no one way than it's try and fail, the games has it's ups and downs you buy and sell

You know you can't stress about this here

I got a room full of space
I got drugs you can take
I'm a give it to you good girl, in so many ways
So many ways

So many ways, there more then one way to love a girl
In so many ways
You got so many curves, let me see you work
I wanna watch you shop
Come here let me hold that skirt
Real nigga go first

Yeah I heard sex is a weapon, but I ain't dead, I ain't dead
Let your pants fall down
Let your tan line show
I'm in the 323, she from the 504
She wanna back it up for me, I told her back it up for me
Then I pulled out the yea boy, and made her strap it up for me
She fast enough for me, she got ass enough for me
And we can all night, if you can last enough for me

[Chorus:]
There she go, there she go
I drive her hysterical, eat her like a cherry though
Let me count the ways, the ways, the ways. [x3]

[Verse 2:]
So let me feel that girl, I know you feel that girl
When you was mine, I gave you good dick
And you know where it's still at girl
Oooh, say you gotta man, soooo do I give a damn, noooo
And do you got plans, hoooo oooh
Cause summer I'm really finna kill it this summer, these other niggas, finna be bummer than I!

[Chorus x3]


Let me take you on a date, date
We ain't gotta wait

He can stay, I just want to get a little taste
And I see you keep your body in shape, look
I just wanna day, back
Damn you look good
Damn you look good, girl
And you look good, need to stop
Niggas came in, two shots
I'm waiting to hear Sugar Free, Quik, or 2Pac
It's the coast, t-shirt, flannel, no clothes
A party ain't a party if my nigga can't smoke
Here we go, let me let me let me make a toast
To baby over there, cause she know I want to poke
No I don't - I just want to stick it in her throat
Drop out the house and go dippin' on the spokes, niggas know
2 12's in the backseat
Passin' by the kids, they yellin' that's me! as I skate
Damn, what's with all this hate
When I come around, can't say it to my face
OK, niggas know I do stay paid
And niggas can get that fade
When I come around, niggas better quiet shit down
You niggas ain't buying Cristal
You sharing that drink
Fuck do I care what you think
I come through wearin' that mink
Niggas all drunk, I don't wanna hit yo blunt
I can fuck with any bitch that I want
Is that yo chick? Niggas looked over like "chhhh"

Just wait, I'm a beat it out like [?]
Goin' all night, just give me like 5 tapes
And I'm straight, dang, that's what I deserve
We gettin' money now, that's what I done heard
Ya'll be in the club with all them nerds

Whatcha gon' do with' all them curves
Teach me something new right now I wanna learn
This ya turn, girl you gotta give it what you got
Ain't nobody givin' you a spot

Wake up girl, this ain't no dream, this my life
Champagne bottles on ice, come through feeling like Mike

Shoutout to the homie from the Bay at the afterparty
That gave me that kill
But I still
Fuck with my nigga Smack
We smoke spliffs with some 96 Cris

Still got it bad for you
Thinkin' bout you at least half of the day
The other half, you know what they say
Kissin' babies, shakin' hands, politickan
Another sneak diss is not what's missin'
So I concentrate more on words now
Give the ball to me if it's 3rd down
I got your back
Wonder why rap at a standstill
We ain't dropped in a minute, yeah
And that is not a coincidence
I learn to live with no regrets
Your girl lookin' like a 9
My girl lookin' like a Tec
She love when I get it wet
Peel panties off of her
If it's work to do then I'm off of her
I got a lot of crosses and pendants
Niggas focused on what I make but not what I'm spendin'
I'm grinnin' hardly as much as when I was younger
Thinkin' they would acknowledge me I couldn't have been dumber
I still rap better than you niggas if I was a plumber
So hit me on the next tour and shout me the number
We leave at 3 AM baby, you know that I want it and I'm back

Shoutout to the homie from the Bay at the afterparty
That gave me that kill
But I still
Fuck with my nigga Smack
We smoke spliffs with some 96 Cris

We're close than that evangelist
You're in Los Angeles
Don't fall in love with the camera
I got homies with so many tats on they face
I just laugh, watch 'em shoot craps, rollin' J's
Still miss my nigga Phil, pour the drank
Real G's don't gossip
Don't be tellin' me what you read on bossip lil nigga
Truth be told I'm tryna find me
Bomb dumb fools in the 90's
Not nowhere near Tuki but don't push me
If I squeeze one finger, I'll get her to talk
With my hand on my heart, don't step on the chalk
It's like the John Wooden book
When your grandma cook
Everybody say "I'm gonna get me some"
I know brothers that rap [?]
And brothers that sell hard
And the ones that nobody know with 12 cars
You will never walk in my house and smell harp
Her body lookin' ready to go a well thot
Of course if I call you a bitch I'm a male dog
My bills too low for me to fall off
Y'all gonna have to take this ass whopping gracefully
Hey Bobby Womack save a place for me, oh yeah

Shoutout to the homie from the Bay at the afterparty
That gave me that kill
But I still
Fuck with my nigga Smack
We smoke spliffs with some 96 Cris


Aye Dom, so far I listened to your album
And I ain't heard nothing you can post up and smoke a Black to

We don't need you on this one
Ha ha, aye! Check it, aye!

Y'all out of town niggas just don't understand
We ain't got the same mindset or the same plans
I done ran wit' my mans, instead of runnin' to the man
Two shows back to back, got paid 50 grand
And a nigga like damn, why you on 'em so tough
Talkin' that shit, cuz his bitch chose up
Tried to give my number in his face like damn,
Then my nigga Jay 305 rolled up
Fresh crew attire, my niggas on fire,
Them 15 inches wires, we put 'em on tires
Then roll up...pockets on swolla
Stand on Stockend, hearin' choppas, not sober
Sometimes I feel like I'm still suppose to be there
And when I stop in the hood, I see Lil C there
I try to show them the hustle instead of fortune and fame
It's a mental battle now, I tell 'em put 'em on game
And niggas love how I do, at the skatin' rink, Girbaud down, nike shoes
Them hoes love how I do, drinkin' Hennesy on stage, House of Blues

Uh, cuz California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California

Y'all out of town niggas just don't understand
We ain't got the same mindset or the same plans
I done ran wit' my mans, instead of runnin' to the man
Two shows back to back, got paid 50 grand
I'm Dr. Dre to the streets, they wanna know when it's gone release
I tell 'em I do big things for you,
Switch planes for you, got a nickname for you
C-A-L-I
A lot of girls fly to the west coast cuz we here
Markeita from junior high, man I hope that she here
All my niggas gone bubble, tell yo homegirls come
All of em is in trouble, we don't close til 1
Wake up at 1:30, in and out for a close
Catch me in the drive thru, then spin out on these hoes
Cuz they love how I do, linked up with Big Mind in the Bay, power moves

Uh, cuz California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas
California is for gangstas, California


The guys always cryin' on twitter ain't my niggas
I be with the ones that's gon' really let em fly with'cha
Westside OPM from now till the sky hit us
This Don Julio and kush got me in my zone

It's time to pay the mortgage
The flow is bout to change up
So I don't really give my number out
Cause then these hoes like to change up

Range up, all because it was good you couldn't pull out?
Most the girls I know that be rockin' golds in they mouth
They ain't even from the south, she know I could go there
You know what I mean we ain't even gotta leave the house

I fuck her the best, in n out, over sonic
Any day without a doubt
I'm like Richard Sherman
In the fuckin' field, jumpin' routes

Hear niggas making noise
So I'm seeing what its bout
I got Jay Pounds, he doing the whole thing on it
If it's good to you baby
You could put the whole team on it
Take the camera out, let me shoot a couple scenes on it
If you that bitch

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout (Check you out)
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout (Cameras rolling)

The guys always crying on twitter ain't my niggas
Asking these hoes about me don't be dry snitching
She be actin funny when she see me
I wanna take her for tortellini have sex that's all steamy

Like a million dollar Hollywood script
You been at blockbuster this whole time tryna' rent
Classics that ain't got shit on how we live now
But they don't celebrate you when you comin' down

They just give you that look, then appraise yo shit
Like that's that twin turbo, I know you paid a grip
Nothing counterfeit, every line you could quote
I could roll stock Forgiatos or spokes 'round this mothafucker

(You know)
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
That's that shit I'm talking 'bout
(You know)

That's that shit I'm talking 'bout

Yeah, yeah

It's a house in Malibu, 13 million on the beach
I'm thinking one day, it might could be me that turn the key
Don't share my same vision, a view, of the ocean is a must
And I pray, every day, that the condoms they don't bust

I'm bout my money (bout my money)
And that don't got shit to do with trust
Remember Pharcyde?

Don't wanna talk no more I was drinking by myself
Thinking the whole time we should be linked up
Maybe a pink tux like, I ain't gon say it

That cologne from CVS, nah I ain't gon spray it
New whips valetin', bad chicks I'm slayin'
Big chips I'm playin' she sucking dick I'm stayin'
I might hit in the AM so you could party all night

Gave her the room number by the Wharf
You fuck with OPM? she said of course
And I could really hear it in her voice
She would've did anything I said
But I'm at dinner with you instead
What that say about you?

Nice skin, [?]

She always tryna know my passcode, steady trippin' on my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that
She always tryna know my passcode, think I'm fuckin' wit' my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that

All the boys make you cry and you end up by yo'self
Lonely and miserable just like everybody else
If you listen close enough you can hear the rain comin'
Type of Fifa score that could make a great husband
I be in the Bay wit' the HBK stuntin', tryna come up a few mill right quick.
We the only ones that keep it real like this
I say "What's been goin' on, you keep actin' real strange."
Went through my cell phone, it ain't much to explain
Black super man, thought you was Lois Lane.
But now I don't even look at you like that
When she call I'm like "Ima hit you right back."

She always tryna know my passcode, steady trippin' on my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that
She always tryna know my passcode, think I'm fuckin' wit' my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that

She a pimp by blood, not relation
Maybe DM some, then replace them
So miss all that, tell me how you buy all that
When you was all at the table frowned up at P.F. Changs
I was hopin' something was up wit' yo Lo Mein
What's going on, you been actin' kinda strange
I'm startin' to get that same ol' feeling back in my brain
Sayin'...I can't do enough, it's not much time these days for the two of us
Plus you think I'm out here livin' like Lucifer
I ain't gone say no names

She always tryna know my passcode, steady trippin' on my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that
She always tryna know my passcode, think I'm fuckin' wit' my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that

She always tryna know my passcode, think I'm fuckin' wit' my last hoe
Why you wanna go and do all dat, why you wanna go and do all that

She always tryna know my passcode, steady trippin' on my last hoe

Real talk, even when I'm with another woman
Living downtown was too much
Every night the doorman meet another woman
I could have a statue downtown

Been hustlin' out here all day
I could finally kick back when you comin' honey
Everybody know
Closed mouths ain't gettin' nothin'
You can't take it with you anyway

No foolish pride when I'm around you

With a dozen of 'em
Long stem roses
'Cause you so gorgeous
And we gettin' close
Let's just toast
To you
To me
To this
You don't even have to be convinced
It's so obvious
By the time you hear this

Goin' hard like I got a child on the way
Stay catchin' thick girls at the concert
Smellin' good in them high heels
That make they feet hurt
I know

Ya body look good in that dress
But it look much better when it's bouncin' on me
I think about you so much
Real talk, even when I'm with another woman
Living downtown was too much

We pull up the two of us, let me hit my fans up
We end up back in Vegas in the lobby Grand Luxe
I was young but I went to the Grand Canyon once
Now I'm at a stripper's house she making tacos rolling blunts
Hope they bring back Earl's really miss the player's punch
I'm the original Dom Kennedy I do my own stunts
If you print me on a t-shirt I'm gonna need it cut
When I call his girl's phone bro she gonna go nuts
The new Silverado we gonna go truck

All my favorite beer on tap
All new cars on the grass, old schools park behind glass

No spots on the glass, blowin' a bag, ain't no stoppin' us comin' up
Like we ain't already done enough, these niggas ain't stunted once

[Dom Kennedy:]
Y'all wanna know
Y'all wanna know
Exactly who I am

You say he trippin' cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

OPM, I'm the franchise
Some things money can't buy
She can get it with her hands tied
Won the game by a landslide
350 on health care
Ask him if he from the west side, he said "hell yeah"
Tell all my enemies I'm doin' well here
95 in the Porsche with the tail up
Tryna figure out if I should hit the milfs drunk
Skinny lil chick, she ain't missed a meal once
We straight to the house, I'm a get the glass cups
No Bill Cosby, used to go by A plus, uh
Half a mil say it's my year
My son almost 6, I ain't stopped since he got here
If it's past New Mexico we can fly there
When you roll with me you gotta hit the joint once
I know it's pretty girls way in Pacoima
That love me to death, they favorite performer
I be in the spot with filets to fork up
And you know we gettin' busy in my room if the door's shut

You say he trippin' cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

U got it like that
Oh God

[Niko G4:]
If she trippin', cut her off then
Bounce back, probably fuck with her best friend
Never talk about money that I can't spend
Only fuck his dog bitch in that progression
All the losses that I took taught me lessons
Gotta be thankful for all my blessin's (thank God)
Niggas coppin' whips, fuck what the cost is
Lil bitch, let me show you what a boss is
VVS, yeah they so fuckin' flawless
A young G, ho I'm so fuckin' lawless
Cause I really came from nothin'
And you ain't really sayin' nothin'
And they just talkin' fuck assumptions
I'm never trickin' but I smash 'em like a pumpkin
OPM, they show love when we walked in
In the club, pop the bub, blow the sparkler

[Dom Kennedy:]
You say he trippin' cut him off then
Guy like me don't come around that often
The money the only thing that I really wanna talk with
Ridin' on leather seats, huh, you a boss bitch

U Got it like that

[Intro]

[Verse 1:]
It's kinda funny how life happened
Ladies used to call me quiet, now I'm nice rappin'
Guess the polo turned her on, yeah the nice fabrics
Shit, I remember when you said you didn't like rappers
That California sun turned to night traffic
We just hit that gutter lane and we drive faster
All I hear is they go down as I drive past her
I don't mind giving my number, if you don't mind askin'
She says she never does but she did this time
Cause she knows what I want
Come up to the show they got yo tickets in the front
But don't tell me you in love when it's only been a month

[Hook:]
Uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh

[Verse 2:]
It's kinda funny how life do you
All you gotta do is ask and bring it right to you
Looking light skinned baby, looking like Nunu
Spoiled LA girls, I'll give my life to you
I'll just took this time out to write to you
It be so good, I don't wanna say goodnight to you
We so close but I don't wanna say wife to you
There's so many things that a nigger really liked to you
If this wrong, I don't wanna be right to you
I be on my macbook trying skype to you
We both gotta iphone so I can type to you
License got suspended and I gotta pull that bike to you

[Hook:]
Yet I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everything I do
Make her wonder why she had a nigger like you
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everything I do
Is everything you heard
And everything is true
Uh

[Verse 3:]
She playin' on my phone tryin' to fuck with me
But I don't need drama
This rap shit is enough for me
My own friends wonderin' what's up with me
But they don't got enough ambition to keep up with me
And this is from the other peoples company
So write my number down and tell your girl to keep in touch with me
I just bought this dodger hat and some chucks with me
I know you niggas mad now cause everybody fuck with me
I give her 1 week till she fuckin me
I give her 2 weeks till she suckin me
I'll give her 3 weeks till she sick of me
From not returning all them phone calls that were sent for me
I love this game
It was meant for me
Send all them girls, a mojito with a mint for me
I gotta a pocket full of singles and some centuries
And I'm just out here tryin' to be the man I was always meant to be

[Hook:]
Yeah
And I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I go
She tappin' on her friend like "Yeah there he go"
And uh
I bet you want me now baby
Bet, bet, bet you want me now baby
Everywhere I'm at
There's always one girl telling me to go back
And uh


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I don't need no calls today
I don't want no company
I just checked my messages
That bitch just broke up with me
This not what it's supposed to be
Sexed you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We gone still be homies right?

[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy]
Saw you just the other day
Seen you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
This our anniversary
But I don't have to take you out
Show up with my other hoes
I ain't got to fake you out
Hit the store all by myself
I ain't got to drape you out
You putting taps all on my phone
Why you trying to stake me out?
I know I ain't perfect but
I ain't who you make me out
I had your love on lock last year
Now you say you breaking out
But I do love Miami girls
Maybe I should take it south
And spend my nights on Ocean Drive
Buying drinks and making out

[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy]
Saw you just the other day
Seen you just the other night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Champagne game
Girl you make me wanna sang
Look into me eyes
Say Versace on the frame
Got me in the car
And you got me on the train
Southern California baby
Where it never rain
Hot cheetos, now and laters and ice cream
Hot Sake, Cortez and dice game
I'm not saying I'm a do the wife thing
I just want to do the right thing (right thing)
That's apologize for the time I hurt you
And the time before that
And the time before that
And the time before that
But uh I just wanted to let you know
I do be thinking about you
Fuck, I said it
I do be thinking about you
Damn

[Hook x4: Dom Kennedy]
See you just the other day
Want you just another night
I can't let your panties go
We can still be homies right?


[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Young Veggies

[Verse 1: Casey]
Aw man, what you haters sayin to him?
Break a chick down, work her out like the sand dunes

Talkin to her friend too that's how a youngin' maneuver
Go hard never bend, been on that better shit
I could say some simple shit, still gone be better than
Destroy all you niggas see me in that Nike letterman
Never talk about it all I do is show evidence

[Verse 2: Dom]
Fitted with a C on it, Belt with a G on it
Hold my dick up, man ya girl wanna be on it
It don't sound good, sound good unless we on it
Name start with a D but I sound like a G on it
Shittin on this song like niggas can't pee on it
Independent artist, but there ain't nothing for free on this
If you gone put me on this, you know I number three on this
That's Dwyane Wade boy you better put some D on this
Damn I love rappin, got my cheese stackin
You must be out yo mind if you think I ain't snackin
Never let no girl friend kick it with no rapper
Dom come first, Veggies came after

[Verse 3: Casey]
I'm blowin up, now tell me how you feel
Makin racks off of rap and I ain't never signed a deal
I ain't never did no jerk shit and I always keep it real
No disrespect to that jerk shit but my music for real
She don't want it, then she frontin like Jay-Z and Pharrell
I do it, I do it big and man, I swear I kill
Thirty thousand and I'm with my nigga Dom Kay
Not what you thinkin my older hoes is what I bring
Countin big Lincolns I'm puttin on for my team
Buzzin through the city like Chirp phones when I was 13
High top Chucks and the polo is Burgundy
I been doin me before a nigga even learned to speak
Swear the boy Chuck [?] shout to LA that's where I be
Right out of Louisiana, coppin a 2 piece in [?]
Hold on, let me not give up the location
Hoes chasin, might find me while I'm eatin chicken
Goddamn it, they can't stand it, man we doin damage
Men lie, women lie but you can check the standings
LA swagger, gettin love in Atlanta
Havin fun no stressin, let's go to Obsessions

[Interlude:]
Niggas tried to play me on it, yeah, look

[Verse 4: cARTer]
Carter got it, been had it, I ain't wanna use it
Y'all hatin from the stands while them girls is rootin
Why the girls was rootin, well that's a dumb Pregunta
She ain't Ms. Cleo but I know she know she see the future
Boys think they turned up, I got bars to mute them
Me and my niggas fell in and then they start reducin
LA swag but don't ask if the kid from Houston
My H high but I'm higher now let's keep it movin
High rollers, we threw the one's then threw the deuces
Dom told her I want some head, yo pussy useless
Gone off the Goosey, plus she know I'm chiefin
A nigga wired up, it's just my eye sleepin
Try to box me out the game, watch how I creep in
On the come up they want a bonus cause they think we easy
Please believe me, just go get my previous
And I hope you know the rate, cause we don't do no free shit
Naw, we don't do no free shit, Carter, yeah

Tailor made...
Uh. I'm talkin about everything tailor made
Yeah... Yeah

So them gold diggers crave it
Put it in a pipe just like them old niggas blazin
"We finto get this money bitch," I told niggas daily
Anything can happen shit I showed niggas daily
I never met a girl in my life that wouldn't date me
True Story, My jeans cost about 240
I fucked 2 shorties in a house that's 2 stories
I can't wear regular shit, it's too boring
So when she see a nigga like me she come join
This designer shit, got a "O" of marijuana
By the China shit, that Dom I wanna meet yo momma shit
No hooks, you know we all about that rhymin shit
Cash Money, Independent, Big Tymer shit
I said, "Girl, I know you know you know you fine and shit
But Goddamn, Why can't I just make you mine and shit?
Why you always actin like you blind and shit?
I know you love the way that we be grindin it
But I don't like them niggas you be ridin with
And them the one's you always end up signin with
Don't ask me when you see me who I'm signin with
Who ever got the most money is who I'm vibin with
Fuck that, who the fuck I'm even jivin with

A million upfront will make a bad year better
Birds ain't flyin off last years feathers
And I ain't eatin off last years cheddar
Ain't no sunshine just ask Bill Withers
Two Hundred twenties make my pockets feel better
Know we got girl friends and they still let us

This that Designer Shit... This that Designer shit (Yeah)
And all them hoes stay in line for this (Uh)


[Intro:]
We back
Answer the phone when a real nigga call
Yea, Chanel Platinum what's happenin'

[Verse 1:]
I just watched the whole game from the corner of the bleachers
And I seen niggas get on cause of they corny ass features
I played the humble role when niggas know I had that ether
Shit I got so many flows I ain't know I had either
Every day I wake up, thank the Lord cause that's my teacher
Kiss my girl, check my phone, grab my hat and then my sneakers
Bitch I'm back, here to save rap so where she at
Still rep that west side, Leimert Park so where we at
The most official, bitches see me in that new issue
So when my plane land she say "Dom I'll come and get you"
Shit is simple, my young niggas grab your pens and pencils
Don't try to be all flashy, just work on the fundamentals
Don't go between your legs before you even learn to dribble
And the man that has a lot, I bet he started with a little
So let yo shit rise and keep yo mind on potential
We all gotta grind, I do mine with instrumentals

[Hook x2: Dom Kennedy & Chuck Inglish]
To all the pretty girls waving and saying hi
We headed around the world so tomorrow say goodbye
It's the livest show on Earth, throwing money in the sky like
La, la, la, la, la

[Verse 2:]
The two, this is going for the whole crew
Them niggas on the Shaw, pulling up in old school
I been waiting on this moment ever since like '02
So get up off the cooler and pass me a cold brew
Oh that's your new lady but to me she old news
She probably got me saved in her phone as Old Dude
Ask my nigga Mike cause I think he close too
I just tell her take a shower cause I'm finna roll through
She wanna spend money, tofu at Nobu
I just tell her let's chill, [?]
Come back, get it in like we really 'posed to
And after you don't know me and baby I don't know you
Keep it cool, I'm feeling like I really can't move
It's too many fine girls, dog I really can't choose
It's nothing that my last tape really ain't prove
I tell my niggas wake up, we finna make moves

[Hook x6]


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
We grew up quick
Talking bout the ones I grew up with
Some Blood, some threw up Crip
We all got gifts
Some just don't ever get found
You wouldn't know cause you ain't never around
I'm heavy with vows
Cameras on and I'm ready to smile
And let the world see the ghetto with style
If I was a child I would hope to understand the future is now
You look good in a cap and a gown
He ain't no thug
He don't really wanna see no judge
He just can't keep his feet out the mud
You better watch yo step
I got your back you should watch yo self
You can't make it out without no help
We grew up proud
South central man we grew up wild
Leimert Park I guess you up now
That's all I hope
You was down when we was all out broke
You my nigga bro
That's all I know

[Hook:]
If the last time I see you is at the end of the night
You gone be my nigga for life
I said we in this wrong world trying to make things right
And you gone be my nigga for life
Just know there's two of us on yo head if we get in a fight
That's why you know my nigga for life
So if I don't make it home at the end of the night
You still gone be my nigga for life

[Speaking: 2pac]
That's what they wanna do, that's what they wanna do
Because now everybody is shell shocked and we having trauma
We be having traumatic nights always
I wanna get away from L.A
You wanna get away from it but you can't
That's what they taught me
The streets didn't teach me that Thug Life live or die
The world taught me that
I thought I could retire and move on
When I moved on into the so called the real world
The civilzed world
These motherfuckers is worst than the niggas in the streets!

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Don't say my name
Westside we don't play no games
We getting money girl it ain't no thang
Can't you tell
We came up when they thought we would fail
I can't picture you just sitting in jail
Let's make that switch
I know a way we can all get rich
It's on paper and it's all legit
You can't make it if you never commit
My first song shit it wasn't a hit
You see I ain't quit
Now my money go as high as a fence
And I ain't never coming late on the rent
I see the moms drop they kids off at school each day
I hope they learn something new each day
Yeah between the liquor stores, gun fights, gangsters, and cops
It's so hard to make it off these blocks
But you gone raise a King baby girl just watch
Keep going please
Don't ever stop

[Hook:]
If the last time I see you is at the end of the night
You gone be my nigga for life
I said we in this wrong world trying to make things right
And you gone be my nigga for life
Just know there's two of us on yo head if we get in a fight
That's why you know my nigga for life
So if I don't make it home at the end of the night
You still gone be my nigga for life


Alright
It smell good too... that's that platinum
Yeah

New hoes, hit em on my new phone
Take her to my new spot, let her hear my new song
I just wanna groove on
I don't sip Nuvo, all these kids smoking, really nothing new though
Coming out the westside, you already knew though
Say you seen me with that bitch, it ain't true though
Kids wanna rap now, need to stay in school though
I wanna give a big shoutout to DJ Pooto
Running from, Deebo
Niggas got, egos
What happen to the beat, damn I miss Theo
I use to smoke stress, now the shit legal
I can make a Rolls Royce fell like a Regal
Pulling up, Peeko
Feeling like, Rico
I could stash 10 thousand dollars in my peacoat
I just wanna freak hoes
I just wanna get doe
I just wanna take her to the lot and get my whip chrome
In my mid 20's, that's what I sit on
Girls grab my pants like "Damn boy yo sh-long"
You need to caress it
I ain't even stressin'
Before you wake up on my dick eat breakfast
And she got pictures, tell her just text it
We ain't got time to have sex, we flexin'
I can see the bottom of her cheek when she strechin'
I hope you don't sleep, cause you know I'm gone catch it
323, you know I'm gone rep it
Other people's money, can you see it on my necklace
You drinking while you driving, nigga that's reckless
Let the girls roll, man tell her get naked
Walk up to her car like "What is this, a Lexis?"
Got a fat ass, "What are you from Texas?"
You don't like me, "What are you, tasteless?"
Put the seat back, damn I wonder where her face went
I'm trying to get right, she trying to get on
This a good trade when we on our way home
She fuck with Trey Songs
I had to play Bone
Do what you do, we ain't finna take long
And my mom don't meet every girl I take home
It's so many places that I'm wanna to get flown
I'm trying to get right, if you trying to get on
I figured we can do something on the way home
Oh

That's yo man right there?
Well check it, that nigga don't live around here
So when he leave, you can come back through, we'll still be outside
Aite
And bring some friends!


Check one, Check two
Damn I'm really making moves
Don't nothing go better than a taco and a brew
Getting heading head from a condo with a view
When she tells me I'm the best
I'm like "What if this is true?"
Much love
Look like five million girls in one club
Murder, murder, murder
O.J. with one glove
And I don't want to fuck that bad
The rum does
You know I get to tripping with the rum does buzz
Not tripping on your man or whatever it once was
I just only need to hit once
Do a little movie
Get a little lunch
You know they say real hoes know how to roll blunts
Don't come around me try pulling those stunts
You've been on my dick
Don't even try to front
I mix grey goose with a cold Playas Punch
And I ain't really had good head in two months
Dom where you been?
Tell em I blew up
And I've got the kind of pockets that'll make you look buff
Last year was cool but it wasn't enough
You know it's something wrong if you see me on the bus
You know it's so right when you see me in the chucks
Got the hard denim jeans
And I'm walking like uh
All the niggas say ho
All the bitches say ow
Just cause you got money don't mean you've got style
I been on this real fly shit for a while
Two sixteens that's thirty-two thou
Get out my way if you ain't trying to get down
Baby keep your head up cause you know I get around
I go pick her up
You know I hit her down
Her man hit me up like
"Ay, you with her now?"
Quit jocking my style
Nigga


I got a bunch of niggas with me, we trying to get rich
So when I walk up in this muthafucka, watch your bitch
See that new black Benz? That's not your shit
It's no squares in my circle so you not gon' fit
And that's J three on fire, he not no bitch
So if you say something wrong he might pop your shit
Man the girls just like me, I'm not no pimp
I swear she give good head but she ain't got no sense
If I see the cops coming, I'm a hop your fence
I'm from Crenshaw and King nigga, I'm not no snitch
Yea that look like me, but you ain't got no prints
All your nigga make songs but he ain't got no hits
He got signed in '09 why he ain't drop no disc
I would have Dodgin' on that, no White Sox on this
Shit I heard Funkflex say that "Pac ain't shit"
And I hope when you see him that he slap your mouth
Don't be looking for me nigga, I'm at your house
Real early in the morning 'fore you back on out
They got camera's in the club so we act on out
And I'm that nigga they be askin' about

I got a bunch of niggas with me, we trying to get paid
The more money I spend, the less money I save
The more money I got, the more honeys I blaze
But don't let these nice clothes get you carried away
I'm from the place where cousin Harold trying to floss that Beamer
Right down on 43rd, right across from the cleaners
You can hear the DPG bumpin through your speakers
And if you get close enough, you might smell that reefer
It's four niggas in a car, get high as the bleachers
And if they don't fuck with you, I can't fuck with you eather
My niggas go to Vegas, so we stay at The Seasons
Like guess who I saw nigga you wouldn't believe it
I might have done some things that you wouldn't agree with
I might have got head from the girl that you live with
I might have just fucked the girl you wanted to be with
I got on my dark shades nigga I can't see shit


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
I went off backstage and I seen her lil frame
She could tell it was me by the smell of Vera Wang
I told her get her money cause' she know I do the same
And she came back to me so I know she noticed game

[Hook:]
And the best of champagne is what we all about
I could come through to the party unannounced
You don't smoke good if you ain't fuckin' with a ounce
And she saying "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"
She hate a nigga guts but she keep me in her mouth
I got 20 Gs that I'm keepin' in the couch
I put 10 on me when I'm leavin' out the house
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"

[Verse 2:]
I walked from the bar then I walked to the car (Come on)
You know who we are, girl I see you lookin' hard (Hard)
Please talk to me like you talkin' to a star
If there ain't no spot in front, I'm just parking in the yard
I been with you all day damn it's only gettin' dark (Ugh)
I think it's 'bout time they we take yo' legs apart
Fuck a tattoo, I'm embedded in yo heart
And I knew I was gon' get you, yeah I said it from the start
You got such a cool shape to have such a small waist (Waist)
If I could have a plate I'd just need a small taste (Taste)
Somehow I never even really have to chase
I'm a get it on-tape so you can't say it was rape

[Hook:]
And the best of champagne is what we all about
I could come through to the party unannounced
You don't smoke good if you ain't fuckin' with a ounce
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"
She hate a nigga guts but she keep me in her mouth
I got 20 Gs that I'm keepin' in the couch
I put 10 on me when I'm leavin' out the house
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"

[Verse 3:]
I was like "Yeaaah!" she was like "Uhhhh!"
Phone still ringing, I'm a hit you when I'm done!
Tell your homegirls come and get you when you done
Shit I like nasty girls, they can get you with they tongue
It was like Menace, seen her in a Civic
I asked for them digits, man it only took a minute
On my way to work, so I called when I was finished
Told her "Meet me out in Venice" and you know that she was with it!
No relationships girl, I just wanna hit it like
Get it... get it... get it... get it ugh (Haha)
And we don't ever say no names
I got money, game, couple chains

[Hook:]
And the best of champagne is what we all about
I could come through to the party unannounced
You don't smoke good if you ain't fuckin' with a ounce
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"
She hate a nigga guts but she keep me in her mouth
I got 20 Gs that I'm keepin' in the couch
I put 10 on me when I'm leavin' out the house
And she tell me "Can you-Can you-Can you-Can-you turn me out?"


[Hook: x3]
Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that playground with steez
Write our the name in the trees

Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that time on the beach
And that sand through your feet

[Verse 1:]
Comin live from never never land
We out in Jamaica getting hella tan
Adidas track pants on and wedding bands
When you see love just go get it fam
She half super woman but she down to earth
It's about who have it last not who found it first
Them tears on her pillow is the sound of hurt
Any time you want to build I be down to work
Just call my number up
Got to keep in touch
Just tell me if there someone else
We got to keep the trust
You always focused on us girl just keep it up
And I'm a take you roller skating before the week is up
I'm always on the road so we don't speak enough
I was told skys the limit so I'm reaching up
Them glow in her eyes just eat me up
Turn them speakers up

[Hook: x2]
Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that playground with steez
Right in the name in the trees

Her smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Like that time on the beach
And that sand through your feet

[Verse 2:]
It's a lot of late nights filled with contemplation
I could read your body language like a conversation
If we never talk again was your time wasted
I'm in a league of my own Tom Hanks
Good people going great places
It don't happen overnight
Shit it take patience
Nothing is the same
Life stay changing
As I put my head down and I say graces

[Outro:]
Warm summer breeze
Playground and steez
Right in the name in the trees
Smile reminds me of a warm summer breeze
Time on the beach
Sand through your feet


[Mike Epps skit Intro]

[Verse 1:]
My homie "G" told me once you got it in a week
They didn't know I rhyme, but now niggas send me beats
Now I hooked a couple fans, booked a couple jams
See me at the party, nigga shook a couple hands
And damn you such a dick blower, yo whole click owe us
And ya own bitch know it, this my lane get over
And Jason had to change the kicks on the on the drums
Cause niggas bite like Tyson when they finna lose
They like "Dom what you finna do?"
Nigga more photo shoots, more interviews
I'm tryin to boost my status up before my minutes through
Cause niggas out in Philly like, "Dom we feelin Tennis Shoes."

[Hook:]
And you said you didn't like it though
Nigga Damn what you bite it fo'?
I'm just tryin to party with them lightskinned hoes
Take a couple shots and we might get blown
Hit a couple spots before the night get gone
Like bitch you better look hot when these lights click on

[Verse 2:]
Please pardon, the way that I be guarding
My flow I don't spit, it's more the way that I be barfing
I'm on fire more the way that I be arson
I already palmed her in the way that I be Carson
On the daily I lay back in my car and
I do nothin, but I work too damn hard Man

[Hook: add to it]
And on... and on

[Verse 3:]
And I'm convinced we, fresh like Mintly
Sometimes I ask myself, "Is this for real nigga pinch me"
To keep Dom sane cause dang
All this pink champagne got me tipsy
And I speak all flame nigga meet champagne
Nigga drench me and send me to Disney Land
With some girls in a Jiggy tan
Ass like Diggy Damn, Saran and a dingy can
Don't you know you can't help style?
Man I'm just tryin to be like myself now
So when I show up, put yo self down
Black Chucks, with the Gucci belt
And you said you didn't like it though
Nigga Damn what you bite it fo'?
If I'm ever onstage and the mic is broke
I'm a just make it rain till the my life is broke
And I know that's not political
Kennedy's don't do that but no we is not identical
And no we is not a syllable
So when they say we back, that mean me they not feelin you
On the beat I rock lyrical
Feel it in the air yes indeed I drop spirituals
Belonging to the Lord, rescue me I got miracles
Can't take the car or SUV I got [?]
With no SUV I knock Erica, we shine so hard
How can people not stare at us
How girls not marry us (Fuck that)
How could MTV not carry this
Roll the Kush with the Berry shit
And don't come to Leimert Park with that scary shit
Every trend change and you bite the style
That's why people don't like you now!

[Hook]

[Verse 4 x4: after every line "Rock, rock on, rock on"]
To all my liars
To all my bitters
You could get inspired
But don't bite us


You might gotta
Y'know I'm saying you might gotta go Earl's
And get you a chili cheese dawg to cruise around in this one
J Skillz what's poppin baby
What's cool baby
Sun shining on this new day
Yes it is

In the daytime
I cruise the city and mind the ladies waistline
To the bassline
Some old quick shit
Or maybe me perhaps
Throwing 2s at the new coups
With the feet to match
Got my new sneakers (Check)
Got my new beeper (Check)
Blackberry keep me connected like the reefer man
Seat back and my speakers blarin
Moon roof slight over-cast
But I'm so over that
I over gas onto the over pass
I'm so slow it's like I'm born fast
How annoying is that?
I'm so cold I got the annoying back
I'm on the road in them Jordan packs
And I'm damn sporting black laces in em
And my Louie got faces in em
And you can give me that Ma
As long as you ain't got braces in em
Now say it with em

In the daytime
I don't know man you like
Y'know I'm saying
You gotta, you gotta let that moon roof go on this one
So necessary on this one
Y'know mean
You gotta, you gotta get that car wash across from R's Wings

Today was a good day too Cube
Picked up a pair of shoes, nice t, and some cooked food
Hit the wine with it
Saw my ex spent some time with it
Quick session did the grind with it
Shes so mine with it
Marc Jacobs she so fine with it
Mack gloss, a lil shine with it
Bonita Applebaum, put me on a lil Tribe with it
It feel good close your eyes with it
Look to the sky baby
That's not a plane that's your guy baby
I shine hard like amoral
I don't be warming up
Come in the game they gone warm you up
Your girl say you ain't warm enough
She wanna join with us
I told Jason he could join her up
It's for life he better warn her first
We don't play like smush in the playoffs
The swoosh on my J Ross
SOB lampin like crooks on a day off
We kick push in a weight off
No I'm not sellin but if I was I ain't tellin
(Shhhh)

In the daytime
It's like
It be one of them days where
It be like December and it like be 83 out in this motherfucker
Y'know I'm sayin, this that
Y'know I mean
You just be crusiing like
In the daytime

Born in God's likeness
Kids in L.A say yeah I wanna be like him
So I try and write some nice good hymns for em
Get my bars up
You know hit the gym for em
I'm just trying to win for em
Slide up Lay-gray baby hit the tin for em
Standing tall as a tiger shit I'm a benz for em
South central or either I'm like a prince for em
Sent form by a higher power
They biting my style but catch me anywhere
My frequent miles fly up
Local celebrity live life yours will never be
That of a Kennedy
Don't be mad at the pedigree
Best ever shit?
I better be
Nah I'm just trying to become a better me
Kill this in trey, leather seats
Hmm like two Carrea deep
But G4 got them Carreas beat
Fuck I care I'm off Albera street,
Nigga this forever E

In the daytime
Y'know mean, and throw like 30 in your tank too
I'm tired of seeing y'all niggas on lagera and Slawson
Every nigga that be there in their Hummers and shit
Like yo, can I get ten on two?


[Verse 1:]
She was 5'5, sweet with a cool body
I wanna say I met her at a little pool party
At her sisters, she was out of town
So she fixed up, LA house parties
You know how niggas get mixed up in Gin
Tonic, Grey Goose, we got it
Didn't like 03 so we was still on hypnotic
Then I spotted her, tapped my nigga Dre like, "I got it brah"
Got at her, called the next day just to acknowledge that
Pride, had to swallow that
Trust, don't want to Hollow that
Your hear can get broken, naw you don't want to follow that
But fuck it, I jumped, We had our little months
We took her to 305, we had our little fun
But your dislikes I did like, yea I remember them nights
I went home thinkin, "Man, I can't do shit right"
I'm damned if I stay and I'm damned if I leave ya
You just wasn't ready and well, I wasn't either

[Hook: x3]
I'm still lookin y'all

[Verse 2:]
Now next it was Sarah, at best it was "whatever"
Cause I was kind of young, and that she was scared of
Like "you dream of Porches, I'm goin Corporate
If you don't want a relationship then I'm gonna abort this"
I did like any nigga would, make her feel important
Had a spot on the roster so I had to fill the void in
A voiding all long term plans, we hold hands like couples do
Tell her "if you want it, it's up to you"
But after we go sexin, she would pose questions
Like, "Like after I spend a night Dom can we go to breakfast?"
HUH? I didn't knew that, right before I screw that
You would catch feelings, now love you can't do that
You say I'm fucked up, but I know it ain't true
I'm a find her one day, but I know it ain't you

[Hook x5]

[Verse 3:]
I'm still looking after (SSSHHHH), Yea she was priceless
The perfect definition what a wife was I liked her
From AIM to the E-Mails, fly little female
Wasn't that official yo, A nigga still miss you though
And Tina was dreamer, I'm 2 years a Senior
So I didn't really vibe with her demeanor but I leaned her
She would say I lied to her like all guys do
But I ain't goin in if I could pull through the drive-thru
And you done lied to, it's not because I tried to
Just that I didn't want to be the dude you always cried to
Leave you I've tried to, but you would always lie through
Like "What you want to eat, is there some shoes I can buy you?"
And the neck you provide boo was wet like the Bayou
I just never did what the next nigga might do
And when you heard this song, I thought you would flip
Oh when we first met, I thought you was it

[Hook]

[Samples:]
She wants that old thing back

Tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy

I'm not only a client, I'm the Player President, One more chance

[Dom:]
This goes out to you [A bunch of times]


[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
HEY!

Gotta beat the heat, even though I wanna play
But you keep me cool you my Watermelon Sundae

Go Head! UH! [x9]
Go Head! UH AH UH!

[Verse 3: Jason Madison]
Seven years ago to today, I met her
She had long hair and I had a bad sweater
Two years and several months ago I kissed her
Then I met her moms and her little sister
And she met mine and we kept tryin
But I kept lyin and she kept cryin
A river in the ocean waves of commotion
She said too much emotion without no devotion
Love potion number nine was her screen name
It was a mean game tryin to keep my thing tamed
She seemed sane but we all go a little nuts
She used to grab the tab but now I pick it up
Pick it up pack it in let me begin
I never pretend to commit a few sins
And since she's committed we had to did it again
I grabbed the Juice and she sipped the Gin
Some men never did what I had done
But my excuse is that we was having a little fun
And funny I remember daily taking her to work
And Watermelon Sundae was her favorite desert, because

[Hook:]
Life ain't sweet, Saturday through Monday
But in the summer time you my Watermelon Sundae [x3]
Gotta beat the heat, even though I wanna play
But you keep me cool you my Watermelon Sundae

Life ain't Sweet
Go Head! [x2]
You my Watermelon Sundae
Go Head!
Saturday through Monday
Go Head!
You my Watermelon Sundae
Go Head! [x2] Go
And then I found you [repeat fade out of the song]
Go Head! UH! [x9]
Go Head! UH AH UH!


[Hook 1:]
I'm only copin the fresh kicks
Who rollin with me
I'm only spotted with the best bitch
Who rollin with me
I'm only hot with that West shit
Who rollin with me
Who, Who rollin with me
I only flow on the best beats
Who rollin with me
And if I smoke it's the best trees
Who rollin with me
I love a girl with a fresh weave
Who rollin with me
Who, Who rollin with me

[Verse 1:]
You know who Dom is, Leimert Park to the heart
Motherfucker ya'll niggas know what the time is
It's ya flyness, kids are so misguided
About Hip-Hop, but this here should remind em
Yup, this here should define em
A soul entity, it's soul in the beats
I'm cold in the heat, I'm so into me
Ya ho be, and you know I'm finna see
What's good with her, If I could hit her
I would have gave her the dougie shit if I could sit up (Huh?)
Nigga I wish I would give up
And let ya'll get the Grammy that I'm supposed to pick up
I'm in the best sneakers, With the best Divas
With no distribution, I make the West reach ya
This that next t-Shirt, with my face on it
Tell the truth ma, you love the way I taste don't it

[Hook 2:]
I only step in the fly shoe's
And signed me up for a size two
I'm a get a six forty five too

I only rock with my hat low
Let's bump this Nas and this Camp Lo
Turn it up let them Amps blow

[Verse 2:]
Man I'm LA's "Say Hey", fresher than 8th grade
Stop the beat one time they bringin back my Grey J's
I'm sharper than a tape fade
Seen round the way more than niggas in them fake Bapes
Excuse me miss are you a playmate?
Oh a video girl and you used to date Ray Jay?
Yea, that's that LA lay
Light skinned thick, shop at Boutiques and DaDa's
Sorry Cube it was a great day
I even take this chick from the Bay that work at SafeWay (Safe?)
Two magnums, did it the safe way
Thinkin back to when I used my radio to make tapes
But now everything they play safe, trap, crack, rap
Shit they gonna take it away Jason
So fuck the beef, power, and K day
Who rollin with me
Who rollin with me

[Hook 2:]
I only rock what you don't cop
Ten West and it don't stop
Skillz beatin, it's gone rock

I sit back and my chick drive
I like yours but this mine
It's top of the world this time

[Verse 3:]
Baby girl, is you rollin with me?
Let's pop it off, have a soda with me
Oh word, ya home girl when to Audubon with me
Myspace, got a photo with me
But don't got the photo with you
So I don't think you get the picture
I'm too sharp to be in Megapixels
My "Put together" be dead official
And I ain't tryin to just bed it with you
Argument's I would dread it with you
Matter fact if there's a ribbon in the sky
I gladly take a ride and go get it with you
I feel like a kid again, no bet, I wanna hit again
I'm just talkin shit again, Man, here go my shit again

[Hook 2:]
Number 9 with a Ice Tea
Let's stand in line for these Nike's G
Thank the Lord for Spike Lee

"Peace Out" to the West Side
From Accord's to S5's
I love four's with the meshed sides

[Hook 1]


It goes one for the weather, two for the trees
Three for the Imapalas, four for the Ds
I don't have a job cause I'm employed by the streets
I make dope music, my niggas flow to it
I bring hope to it, like Ali at the Olympics
... Though my vibe is something different
It's live and something rhythmic
Might remind you of the Tribe or something near it
But I strive for something closer
I'm more NWA when they was running through the posters
Remember popping up your toaster
To get your pop-tart to make it back before commercials?
And Family Matters was your curfew
When it got canceled did it hurt you?
I almost crushed up the changer
... But I had a crush on Topanga
And 36 was the Chambers
I wish I knew then that hip-hop was endangered
What I wouldn't do to save her
(... But why wouldn't you just change her?)
I'm all out of tears like I'm M.J. Blige
Don't wanna be LeBron or what MJ was
Cube go (ooh), and BIG say (ahh)
... And yesterday was a good day
Drove it to the pad and I'm coastin'
New fresh tee, pair of kicks and a Oakland
And just yesterday some dude came up and asked me
Where I was performing, I told him "nigga that was last week"
No question, gave him a handshake and showed this girl some affection
So I can run up in her section
I'm at Leimert Park, the intersection
I really love head and into sexin'
And we getting chips like keno
And hitting all them girls in skinny jeans that dress emo
Live in high-def, no TiVo
Ladies love Dom, that blackberry-dash, T-Mo'
And she know exactly where I be though
Right in front of Earl's, Player's Punch with the Fritos
Undefeated cool, so cool like Tebow
I should win a Heisman just for rhyming on these beats so
Reload, fifteen in the clip
Cause I don't want my mom so sick like Ne-Yo
My sister found Nemo, I found some old Premo
Tell Big I love the do' but I ain't never rolled cee-lo
Leimert Park styling, D's with low mileage
She is so 'bout it, I am so down if
She goes down, goes down like 4s bouncin'
And we can get high, get high off four ounces
Haha, I boardwalk with four houses
All my young niggas waste money, no accountants
Views of the marina, bitches know the outcome
Urban Outfitter jeans, baby come up out them
X with no Malcolm, rose with no stem
I lay it on thick, your flow is so thin
Like opening my front door, you know I go in
Your girl is so wet, she know I'm gon' swim
I guess that's the end...


[Dom:]
I don't argue over dumb shit
Back of Barneys top floor on my lunch shit
Chicken salad don't mind that we here
Make a purchase or two then we disappear
[?] hand rug
Exec mindset and thug
The Jay 305 laminates
Ooo I see they got you standing in
Slide me the Crown kid
This shit poison like Bell Biv DeVoe
These little rappers can't fuck with me, I quote
I trained 'em all like Freddie Roach
You want a building start banging
Guess that's the cost of being famous
I remember you was more cool than that
I used to be around the ones that could shoot craps
My niggas ran out with the Ralph outta TJ Maxx
Creatine in the beats let me hit the abs
Buy yourself a duplex get your chick a Jag
I got the next hundred years yea it's simple math
Fuck what you claim this rap shit is lame
Don't even own nothing not even yo name
Can't go through formulas the label gets paid
6'1" and a half and I don't play no games

Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style

Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style

[Smoke DZA:]
Kings handle business we don't pout about it
If nothing else, make sure the ounce exotic
I live in the mouth of goddess
Walk around looking like a house deposit, uh
Too many niggas, had to bounce, was crowded
If only all these daps could amount to product
Uh, I guess I'm guess I'm wishful thinking
I never compromise my brand with risky instincts
Might cuff the whole plate
Oversize tees youngins [?] the whole K
Businessmen sitting business class
Six hour flight and I slept the whole way
Don't hate doggie, be better
I don't dwell 'less I sea dwella
I'm on bullshit time
Arm warmed up, out the bullpen flying

[Dom:]
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style

Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style

Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style

Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style
Don't copy my style


Bathin' Ape sweatsuit Cartier glasses
I wish I walked around [?]
Can't even take a day off it's so intense
You know feeling when you riding around, paper tents
How dare you looking like you ain't convinced
When it's fall I bet we still rake it in
It's no room you can't have this much paper in
This niggas ghetto as fuck and still can't swim
I touch water so clear
I was already a player
Just made me aware
Diamonds I share
My son is my heir
He gone be wealthy as fuck
He gone be healthy as fuck
Gucci polo for picture day
She just can't wait for February to come
Black Chanel with the bow to match
Some where along the way we got so attached

Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
When shit got hot
[x2]

Oh now y'all want to talk black businesses
Come to LA get your apprentice shift
On Crenshaw I'll have this liquor store
Sydney Lyons say nah just give them more
Don't never quit the game if you love it
You might not ever get to see through [?]
All them nights spent with hoes got repercussion
But when you 80 dawg who you gone end up with
I might just hit it out the park like Justin
Game 2, paid dues
I remember rocking songs for the first time
I remember taking off her thong for the first time
I need everybody to stand like church time
And when I see the skyline off the turnpikes
And LA sunset with you by myself

You know
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
When shot got hot

I wish the world were truly happy (when I wake up in the morning)
Living as one
I wish the word they call freedom someday would come
Someday would come

Lionel Richie never lied
Lionel Richie never lied
Lionel Richie never lied


Same thing (yeah)
Back and forth
Same thing
Same thing
Back and forth it's the same thing

You love me then you hate me, then you love me (hah)
My eyes ain't on rap, it's the country
Shit, Hillary Rodham was the 45th
Until ya'll let em know niggas true intents
Fuck your advance money, I made her dance for me
Benz ashtray full, I'm half baked
Still can't believe I crashed the cabriolet
Layed up in the bed watching Training Day
Two gats like Lonzo, take that
You wanna be from LA, you gotta pay a tax
To me I'm brown skin but they call us black
Get caught slippin, you gon' take a nap
Police ain't the only one with handcuffs
Dunkin' on niggas and get the And-One
Yeah, real men water they plants, bruh
Serve free breakfast like a Panther

You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they suppose to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways

Yeah, you know
Everybody come from somewhere different
But at the end of the day, we all in the same struggle

Yeah, daily I be on my paper route
I graduated from that vacant house
I was sellin' rocks on a dirty couch
Slauson Ave, where motes don't make it out
I had to hustle back and forth
Making plays off of granny porch
Louboutin sneakers with the khak' shorts
I'm a product of the street but I ain't ask for it
My pockets full of dead presidents
All the hating is irrelevant
God's gift, yeah I'm heaven sent
We risk our life just to pay the rent
You [?]
Part of South Central where they kill men (East Side)
We take a lot of losses but we still win
Nowadays ain't no such thing as real friends

You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they suppose to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways
Yeah
How far you go in life, it's all based on your decisions
For what it's worth, keep living
You better watch them niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they suppose to do
Cause you know they been thinking bout
Never personal, nowadays it's the ways


She's falling under my spell
She's falling
She's falling under my spell
She's falling
She's falling under my spell
She's falling
She's falling under my spell
She's falling

Even if the steak's still Outback
Don't ever question ya man
I'll put you out on both legs
In between [?]
I know exactly how to play it
Make enough for the both of us, I'm just saying
And the sweater is Champion, like Ambien
Somehow I beat the averages
Pretty toes, cute face, shine like my prezzy
If looks could kill, I'd be dead already
You know

She think I only want her 'cause she fine
But to me that girl is official
[x4]

Imperial Highway to the restaurant
On your wedding day what type of dress you want?
If it's in the stars like Orion's Belt
On my bad days could you make patty melts?
You done heard the story from everybody else
I'm the real source for the vibes you want
See all these niggas tryna size you up
Just wishing that they could spend time with her
Guess I'm too complex for the front of the Fader
With all due respect, I made too much paper
To ever give a fuck what you feel 'bout me
On our first date I wore black cement 3s

She think I only want her 'cause she fine
But to me that girl is official
[x2]

She's falling under my spell
She's falling
She's falling under my spell
She's falling

You been on my mind since we met, love
So nasty they forgot what triple X was
I put two fingers up and all the experts
With Dom K she do her best work
In my world they judge a man by his net worth
Teach him how to buy clothes, not invest first
Chain hanging on my Gosha sweatshirt
The Grey Goose in my system make the Benz swerve
Don't change who you are for popularity
If she trippin' just let her leave
No shame in my game, I'ma let it be
Keep everything so letter G
She asked me how I know so many strippers
She asked me how I know so many strippers

We been gettin' it in
We been gettin' it in (we have)
We been gettin' it in
Shit, I ain't gone front (no)

Since Troy Aikman, I been penetrating
Got authentic tags on my jersey's
2 a.m. but to me it's still early
And sometimes fine bitches curve me
I don't get upset, I get massages
And 12 packs of Hanes socks at the Target
Been hit Balenc', told em charge it
Stacks was against me cause I'm dark skin
Me and number 7 in the same boat
I love Malcolm X too, I got the game sewn
I don't get to sell shit to get my chain froze
Diamond in the ruff, ya'll rainbows
I got on all black with these Stan Smiths
Don't make me have to hop another damn fence
Have me on the ropes but I'm cautious
Pink Ace of Spade, no glasses

We been gettin' it in
We been gettin' it in (we have)
We been gettin' it in (haha)
Shit, I ain't gone front (no)


Every white girl wanna fuck a nigga in a Benz
Trust me on that one, love Cleopatra
And the Scarlett Johansson's dog
Who gon' mix my bath water with the Epsom salt
Might make her a first lady like Tipper Gore
Name the airport after me, we only moving forward

We can't wait for the day King's dream come true
And we can't wait for the day King's dream come true
Said we can't wait
We can't wait

So you invite yo friends, I'll call my friends
We can watch Con Air, let that sink in
This 4K HD put me in the stores
I'm running white walls nicknamed it Forrest
Send her home happy like [?]
Damn...
Keep the popcorn I just need applause
So what's the chances, I can get some candid
Time with you alone I been minding my own but
I wanna take you to the movies if you haven't
Seen the one that's out now let's make it happen
Don't be shy sip your martini keep it raw
Half Naomi Campbell half Kate Moss

Time flies when you're having fun
Time flies when you're having fun
I wanna take you to the movies
I wanna take you to the movies

So at my funeral don't talk about rap songs
Bury me with my 9 named it Matt Barnes
Wore Phat Farm, Rush you owe me for that one
More champagne, more Mr. Chap[?]
House by the Canal what you drop for it
Other People's Money what you got for us
I eat beats like beef ribs, collard greens, and yams
Hit my Fred Astaire
I'm just over-prepared
[?]
Go Antonio Banderas
The Monte Carlo SS
All the comments say "yes"
You ain't getting no money
I spent that on two chairs
Recline on that

And we still got a long way to go

Go! Time flies when you're having fun
Go! Time flies when you're having fun
I wanna take you to the movies
I wanna take you to the movies


Let's bow our head, both hands fuck it

Lord bless our food
Bless our mood
Bless our homies
Bless our girl
Bless our thoughts
Bless our ad-libs
[x2]

This is non fiction
This is non fiction

I'm tired of fucking these fucking these ungrateful girls
Tried to go big on me told her don't do that
Feelings up a trial let my lungs collapse
Woke up this morning bitch I'm done with rap

I need something realer
This ain't no run up to the mill
This Aliyah's one in a million but still y'all boys don't feel
I set examples for the children
K live doing [?] appeals
Standout like Jameis Winston around these Dilfords
The hood Quincy Tarantino jacket real fur
Told her don't suck me off we gotta chill first
Jay Skill say he coming after Spielberg
I rather live in St. â than see trial
Hit Pacific Diner Car then blow a cloud
This AMG is what we floating in now
Time heals open wounds reconcile

Lord bless our food
Bless our mood
Bless our homies
Bless our girl
Bless our thoughts
Bless our ad-libs

This is non fiction
This is non fiction

We need a SOS
I think we need a SOS
For all this Mack of Love
Running to Vegas let's peace up
Bump into Karrchue while eating brunch
We use to stay at the flamingo can't even front
Told myself I gotta be rich at least once
So asked Gavin McNeal he know what's up
As long as we got each other we got enough
Signing docs at the house gave me paper cuts
I wished that for my life and my dead niggas
I can feel your soul bumping through the system
We use to drink and drive out to riverside
Living dangerous as fuck
These snipers ain't enough to get me 15 bucks
What am I suppose to do with that
I'm getting skinny but I'm counting racks
Health is wealth what's going on she ain't calling back
I done really fucked up this time
Look like I done really really fucked up this time
I'm off from January until December
Alkaline water and tequila in my liver
Smoke this club papers with the kush in the center
Never no cocaine in it
I can't hang with it
I might jump, I already wore my Armani suit too much

Lord bless our food
Bless our mood
Bless our homies
Bless our girl
Bless our thoughts
Bless our ad-libs

This is non fiction
This is non fiction

Give credit where it's due at
Give credit where it's due at
SOS, I think we need a SOS
Yeah, yeah


Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up

Pulled up out of valet playing Last Name
To the Spanish hut like the Batcave
Scared on the inside, you ain't that brave
Scared on the inside, you ain't that brave
Send that text message through a clear signal
Thoughts in my head of you real sinful
I ain't in a rush, doors liftin' up
I might be good for her
Maybe one day I'll have a set of twins
And be as good as HOV, God let me in
Pop the last advil for the migraine
Went t-shirt shoppin' with my side chain
Truck sittin' high, told her climb in
When I get open, I'mma dive in
Til then I'm ridin' with my only son
Throw it back like you owe me one

Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up
Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up
Cup always poured up
Glass always poured up

Real Rollie diamonds but the bezle sucks
All I need is my [?], just fetty huh
Shopping sprees lasting over several months
Got Crys' in the fridge like it's Ketel One
Sugar Ray Leonard with these jabs (with these jabs)
Caesars Palace shops, couple grand (couple grand)
Never bite my tounge for these snake niggas (haha)
18 karat gold ring, I'mma stay drippin'
The best to never sign and got away with it
Wake up wondering what day it is (day it is)
Got your girl back on her Dom K' again
Coldest to ever do it, no mistaken this

Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise

Yeah
So as we conclude our little love story (love story)
I see the Police, baby hold my drugs for me
And that's the type of shit we call very loyal
Can Bankhead Bounce but I ain't from Georgia

Styrofoam always poured up
Weed always rolled up

Yea. So since the 25th Hour, I been a lot of places, met a couple people, seen a lot of faces. Shout out to everybody that supported me since day one. Everybody and anybody that ever, told a friend they need to check out this guy that go by the name Dom Kennedy from Leimert Park, California. That'd be me. I appreciate it. Everybody's hand I ever shook, every picture I ever took, I appreciate it. My dad, thank you. Two words: thank you. My mom, I'm still here, tryna make you smile, tryna make you proud. My cousin J.O., when you come home, it's on. Special shoutout, to Bobby and Ben for understanding my vision, supporting me. Special shoutout, to myself for seeing my vision and supporting me.

Special shout-out to the whole, whole, whole West side 6, 7, 8, 9 It go...
We used to run streets now they just ours
My luck has been good we made it this far
You probly went to class, we skipped ours
And when we never came home baby we sent flowers
It's grind time, missed showers
Had my iPod playing that 25th hour
I used to mess with red bull til they went sour
Had my lil heart charged up to the 5th power
If I could fly, I'd rather ride
Dead or suck? I'd rather die
I'm the new DMC with a leather eye
Strings in my adidas hang loose and they never tied
I could go all day I'm never tired
Hand on the bible, I have never lied
I had my back to the wall it happened several times
Few broken bones, cracked ribs and a severed spine

[Hook:]
But Go Head
Go Head
Go Head
It go If we ain't runnin'
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

So when things are looking grim
You wanna see the light well baby just look at him
You be crazy to look at them
It's all smoke and mirrors so maybe just look again
But this time try not to see it with your eyes
See it with your soul, see it with your vibe
Never mind the earth never mind the fire
I was in it too but it was only online
I was thinking to myself they don't know me online
I'm famous where I live at the city hall making changes for the kids
No more danger at the crib
I'm notorious too had to change it after BIG
Then I went to see the movie had to sang it at the bridge
I'm a bad boy with no puffy
I'm on my cycle, no monthly
When I cruise in my city I do it so comfy
There's only one girl in this world that I know love me

[Hook:]
But Go Head
Go Head
Go Head
It go If we ain't runnin'
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

It goes hats and tees by the SLB [x8]

[Dom Talking:]
I know I didn't always come home when you wanted me to Ma
But it's aight
It turned out aight
I'm still here

And tell em like If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

Sometimes you gotta stand up on your own... That's what I had to do

It go If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

I just hope I make you smile

It go If we ain't runnin
Yeah the world suck but hey we ain't done it when police start comin'
Go Head
Go Head

That's our theme song... This a champions song


[Intro: Dom Kennedy]
Ya'll thought we was playin huh?
HellaGood... Polyester the Saint
I told you we was the future of this street shit

[Hook: Polyester the Saint]
Can I blow yo mind, uh oh uh oh [x8]

[Verse 1:]
[Polyester The Saint:]
It's a clear sunny day in LA with the top back
Bumpin that 25th Hour, oh yes I still got that
Doublin up my stack, I got that green on contact
Anybody need it we can met on Bronson
But if you get caught then me don't know nothin
[Dom Kennedy:]
What that shit you said "P"
[Polyester The Saint:]
Me don't know nothin
From Long Beach to Compton
Anywhere between, Holla at ya boy if you need that lean
[Fades in to Dom on "lean"]

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Lean on me I got that good shit
Good shit, Good shit
And I'm so available cause I just don't be lookin
I'm gone be her favorite, she can't get a better one
I had me a bad bitch, came back with a better one
They don't make em like me, she say she gone get her one
Panties drippin wet tell her yes I could get her some
You can ask yo home girl, she know I be doin thangs
I don't got no tool box, but she know I be screwing thangs
Taste like bubblegum, she know I be chewin thangs
Shorty swing my way, songs that you would sang
Like Poison, Poison
I be hearin voices
Bittin on my neck all night and she be makin noises like

[Girl talks:]
Yeah, like we always do nigga
Dom, I got you baby
Who these kids think they playin with
VIP never payin shit
Liemert Park where we stay and shit
Wine cold the trees rolled
Shoes match the bag
We ain't worried bout the tag
These niggas want what they can't have
Everytime we rollin out
They know what it's about
If you quit goin fresh
They gone forget how to dress
But they still keep followin yo steps
Dom Kennedy, Past, Present, and next year


[Dom Kennedy Speaks:]
Welcome, welcome, welcome everybody, we doin this all the way live from Leimert Park California tonight, please put all tips in the jar, all tips in the jar, I brought my man poly tonight to help me out, yeah

[Verse:]
The first we went to eat you know it transpired
I had to heat that ass up like a campfire
My other girl tell me I'm wrong but I'm a stand by her
And I know you wasn't out with michael you a damn liar
I'm knowin mostly I ain't right but damn I am trying
And there's a good nigga inside but man I can't find em
I do be stylin on these hoes and well they ain't blinded
They like international niggas and well I stay flyin
She fell in love the night she caught me on that stage rhymin
She turned around I walked up and told her
"Hey I am, well huh, you could use my government
Dom is getting famous now I already had enough of it"
My niggas get the good girls, I just get ot fuck a bitch
Some niggas want this lifestyle, I don't get the just of it
My ex is callin right now, we shouldn't be discussing this
I tell you your my only one, you really don't be trustin it
Gotta couple secrets locked, I don't want you bustin it
So when I leave my phone somewhere, I don't want you touchin it
I swear I love you so much, I don't want you suckin it
Questions bout condoms, I just get to duckin it
Cheatin ain't fun though, I just get the rush of it
It wasn't how it looked then but honestly I must admit
Comma, to whom it may concern
Damn this boy is good hearted and soon it may emerge
It's way more then it's surface like the moon they say it's curved
But until that day arrives her iTune will play that N.E.R.D
Cause I know how you feel, I really think you doesn't
You said that you would wait for me, I really knew you really wasn't
What's up with the new guy I heard he do construction
You couldn't make my party huh you knew I threw that function
You fuckin with my homies now you knew I knew a Justin
I just hope you happy though whatever you come up with
I ain't send no love yet, I'm just cool with justin
Besides you like fancy spots, I'm just cool with Truxton's
I don't know what it was, I just knew it wasn't
Cause you the flash ya lights type and I don't do the clubbin
Right after the 2nd date, I don't move to husband
And you could probably tell by now I wasn't to accustom
To takin responsibility, I'm talking chivalry
And I'm apologizing to any girl that had to deal with me
Fuck being real with you, I'm just bein real with me
We could make a home love, you just gotta build with me
I don't need that loud shit, you just gotta chill with me
If life's a bumpy road, it's a lotta hills with me
Never let em see you sweat, it's a lot concealed with me
I wanna do it the right way, it's a lot enstilled in me
And still with me is the very first time you said you will
But all I guess I really wanna know is if you still me

[Hook: Polyester]
It's a shame, the way I messed around with ya heart, It's a shame, I'm so sorry [x2]

[Dom Speaks:]
Still miss me? Nah, I wouldn't if I was you either, I finally made you a record though, oh it's not what you had in mind? [laughs]
If I could take it all back I would, but I can't, and you are who you are, because of the things I did, I think about it all the time, sometimes, I just wish we could start over... Guess I'll see you next lifetime


I used to sell clothes, now I sell dope
They ask me can I rap for free and I just yell no!
I'm trying to get paid, take it up the block
Inglish got the bass, I told him make it while it's hot
Take the whole thing, break it down to rocks
You don't need a bag let it stay up in your socks
White socks fitted, I'm chilling on top
A rookie in the game but I'm feeling like I'm not
Life after death, feeling like I'm shot
I'm bout to go dimin' from what's chilling in the pot
Who need a hit? I got slick words
This is not a movie but you can get served
Don't want to be no star but I got big dreams
Some niggas got jobs, but I got sixteens
Trying to go legit, don't want to break laws
I guess they was right, hard work be paying off
And I tell 'em like

[Hook:]
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper

Umbrellas up, my reign has begun
Amongst all the legends, my name has become
Shine so hard, playing in the sun
My mind playing tricks is what we played when we was young
Shoot the hot five is what when played when we was done
When you snapped your fingers niggas say where they was from
Cars pulling up, say where they was from
Hopping out active homie take away your lunch
Take away your dinner, take away your brunch
Sizing up your chin so they can take away your fronts
You was in the back, I was in the front
Hit the polo racks, my niggas buy up what we want
Get a nice fade, line up in the front
If I'm in the club, there's a line up in the front
Cocoanut juice, the lime up in the blunt
In 2008 I pushed the rhymes up out the trunk
I worked hard

[Hook:]
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Balling like an athlete but got no jumper


Yeah
I just need a minute of your time (just a minute of your time)
Can I please have a minute of your time?
Yeah
Get a minute of your time

Ever since we was 12 I've been wanting you to hold
You never was around when I wanted you to roll
Now I see you once, if I'm lucky couple months
I be with this music and you always coupled up
Duffled up or backpacked, the show must continue
I got a couple beats right now I want to send you
I got a empty heart right now I want to lend you
But love don't buy shit so right now I love this pencil
When the mic I record with, nights I get bored with
So I be tryna write some shit that I can hit the stores with
Spit it a cappella and have a nigga on some floor shit
So you can see me at a Laker game on some floor shit
I wanna explore her, that's some ford shit
These hoes don't pay attention cause they probably can't afford it
Haha
But I told you she was beautiful
I told you she was beautiful
And now it's like 2 and I'm tryna make good
Them promises I made that I was gon get us out the hood
Never come back, probably get us out for good
If this was '94, I'd probably give this out to Suge
Like yeah nigga I'm on, posing like I made it
I had a couple cuts but them niggas wouldn't fade it
So I kept writing, booked time and I laid it
Now I couldn't tell you all the girls that I done laid with
Man I couldn't tell you all the places that I played in
Shit I couldn't tell you all the places that I stayed in
Clothes that you rap about, shit that I stayed in
You niggas get love but that's the shit that I was made in

Well, they told me I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful
I told you I was beautiful

Like Stevie on the keys, Isley on the string
Every time I see it, it reminds me of them things
Every time I see you it reminds me of my dreams
Everything is fine, hope I find you when I leave
Just because I style they think I ain't broken
And just because I smile, they be thinking I be jokin
I pass on the blunt and niggas think that I be smokin
Bust my A's hat and people think that I'm from Oakland
But I'm just athletic, just as ready
And when I say you fine I'm talking just aesthetics
Cause it's kinda a faÃ§ade, you steady goin out
Chest be poking out, when you know you got a job
And you barely got benefits, talking what you finna get
It's all cool now but I want you to remember this
Matter fact don't remember shit
Especially old girl that you caught me out at dinner with
Sin a bit- pray more, thank you for this day Lord
I only answer to you so I shouldn't have to say more
Uh

And I told you life was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful
I told you it was beautiful

As women on the stretch pole
Why we so disrespectful?
Why Jesus resurrect for?
Some things you never get told
How beautiful this sound be
I'm just happy that it found me
Karma comes around, niggas
I'm just glad I'm already down with her
This from my side of town with it
That rest in peace James Brown with it
But I don't wanna get to loud with it
I just hope I make you proud with it

And I told you we was beautiful (J. Skillz)
I told you we was beautiful (Yeah)
I told you we was beautiful
I told you we was beautiful (Look at us now)
I told you we was beautiful
I told you we was beautiful (Haha, second time around)
I told you we was beautiful (Do work)
I told you we was beautiful


[Intro:]
"We're not drug dealers... We're fundraisers."

[Verse 1:]
Check 4, 5... 4, 5
Check, Check
Now when my cousin through in that all Blue Kitted
They was ridin down business with them all new dishes
His tapered as Jeans matched the Alt Blue sixes
Cause he good at pushin rock like Rod (Who?) Strickland
And the dope boys love em and the game need his diction
Smartest out the line, still do crime (What a [?])
And his brother's locked up but he always send him pictures
And his best friend's gone but he always send him liquors up
Smokes from the joints that he rolls to remember when
They was little kids receiving toys in December then
They was just to young to enjoy all the simple shit
Like, "Ay I got a crush on this girl let me mention it."
Cocaine Membership, Propane finish it
No names givin just that dope game livin

[Hook:]
And if this was 92' they would have beat yo ass
Nigga if this was 92'...

[Verse 2:]
Soul Train rockin, Gold Chain Clockin
Yo shit is all plain and my thang got that hot
Ring match the watch, tell them girls to watch
Fuck Scarface nigga tell the world to stop me
I ball like I'm [?] get calls like Verizon
I ain't Freeway Rick but it's all on my horizon
Rivals will despise him, Hollows will divide them
Gangstas make the world go round but how is that surprising?
Servin in that [?] straight on my Andre [?]
I'm risin like the baking soda I'm supplied with
I get winkers when I'm spending money high pitched
I let it talk for me I don't even talk money
I despise it, Isaac, Newton with the math
I be doin Ewing's, sweatin money like I'm Jewish
While the [Pause for Sirens] is pursuin
They can't catch me I ain't movin
They can't stretch me I ain't losin
All this Pepsi I be movin, No Cola
Oprah buildin schools overseas
And wonder why we graduate and come back in Rover deep

[Hook:]
I say if this was 92' they would've beat yo ass
Nigga if this was 92'...

[Verse 3: x4]
Cocaine for eons, my rope chain like Neon
I'm so paid with no shame, thanks dope game nigga we on

Call me Mr. Clark by the way that they all lean on
Moi, to get they high
It's in Demand, I got Supply
I'm the man that's not for pliers
Ralph Lauren, that's not [?]
Glah! [x10]


[Dom Speaks:]
Things finally looking up, Girls finally getting down
When hoes around slows you down

Yea

[Verse 1: Dom Kennedy]
It's either be on my team, or you'll probably lose
The day you shut down my city nigga I'll probably moved
I feel like I'm the only nigga poppin and that's probably true
Poly set the screen, I'm just waitin on my alley oop
My girl is sweeter than berrys, Halle too
I might get her a couple rings if she Audi cool
AA'in it's hard to stay patient, when you hear that M5
And the nigga paid Franklin's
Hollywood sign, my little niggas stay adjacent
It's money in the air like somebody sprayed a fragrance
What success sound like when you dressed down nice
Damn... Everything I do in the West sound right
This feel like Nike when they just found Mike
Or them black and white commercials when they just found Spike
Then them Porsches in a circle getting spint round twice
I ain't makin money off music? Then what this sound like nigga?

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Ya'll do ya'll dog and I'm a do me
And in the end trust me we gone see
The real one that's destined to be
The Coldest Nigga Of All Time
Who are you dog compared to me?
You the States I'm over seas
C.N.O.A.T, Coldest Nigga Of All Time

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
Black candle, Black lighter, Black Roses
I'm showing niggas the way I'm like the black Moses
For South Central, LA this like the Black Opis
King of 8th nigga get ya Google Maps open
LA's finest pull me over with they whack slogan
And pound my shit if you want, I'll be back rollin
A week later I'm at the lot with a stack, Hold It!
Shit I got a generation on my back (Go in)
For loose listeners I don't want to petition ya
Hand over my heart if you fuck with me unconditional
Fortune 500 Dom on my Mom
It's like Iraq in this shit, tell Flex drop the bomb
Number one with a bullet, bet I knock it off
Best nigga in LA if I'm never not involved
I be aimin for the heavens I ain't never shot at blogs
Why you scared to speak to me? I ain't never got at ya'll. Hah

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]

[Verse 3: Dom Kennedy]
Fear em, soon as you hear em
Upon my arrival the real niggas cheer em
Black Mac Book, keep my business in line
I think a Jesus Piece might keep my Spirit Divine
But I read a passage to keep my lyrics in line
I ain't reached the masses but still I feel I've been tryin (Naw)
Shit at least I feel I can grind
Million dollar deal, at least I will when I sign (HA)
You spent a DEM on your cloths
Buyin Louis belts I can see em off a show
Fuck Video hoes, I done seen em when they broke
Tryin to get a date I done seen all in they throat

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]

[Verse 4: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Even in the summer four key stunner
(Coldest Nigga Of All Time)
And you ain't never got to wonder, on out the summer

Hurry up take a picture, Cause you don't want to miss the

Dom

[Verse 1:]
This sound like a curtain call, tell em bring the Oscar out
Get my Godfather on, tell em bring the pasta out
My niggas eatin good too, tell em bring the Lobster out
I got these bitches burnin up, tell em bring the doctor out
I clutch like Fisher, rollin up like Swishers
A over night celeb blowin up like Twister
Young like Carmelo, but I feel like Isaiah
So fuck BET if them niggas don't want to play us
And fuck Interscope if them niggas don't want to pay us
But I might take that back if you niggas know what I'm sayin
Some old DJ Quick, you niggas know I'm playin
It's Showtime baby you niggas know I'm sayin
Let's Go

[Hook:]
Where all my niggas at? Twisted in them fitted caps
I just to get it, but I get just to give it back
[x4]
It's Showtime niggas (What Up)

Where all my Ladies at Beamers and Mercedes black
You in this shit to win it, just remember I done gave you that
[x4]
It's Showtime niggas (What Up)

[Verse 2:]
Now I got my bounce back, tryin to get the money up
Bitch I'm in the studio, ain't tryin to pick no Honey's up
You listenin to yo home girls, they hear you with that funny stuff
Tryin to have my baby now, I'm tryin to keep yo tummy tucked
Six pack shaped right, head like snakebite
Curves like a new Benz, I'm tryin to hit them break lights
To make nights memorable, I'm hopin for an interview
And when it's all over, I'm just hopin I remember you
Cold like December you know I'm not into you
I know you heard "Bite Me" look you know I got interviews
Photo's and promo's, smilin like my logo
Shout out Crooks and Castles dog
But now I'm in this Polo
Let's Go

[Hook]

[Dom Kennedy Talks:]
Crenshaw and King... Be Cool
Arlington and Jefferson... Be Cool
South Central... Be Cool
Inglewood... Be Cool Ya'll
Compton... Be Cool
Watts... Be Cool
Leimert Park... Be Cool
The Whole West Side... Ya'll
Let's have a safe summer LA
I love ya'll
Gone


[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Look for me
Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world end, doing 85 in my ride
And these niggas hiding, know I'm striding like a giant
I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him I'm a diamond
I know these niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking "This is what I did it for"
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trife and Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

[Bridge: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms
Doms

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Doms, why they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit?
Shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New Patterns, and patty-caking with mannequins
Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all of 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs and that's
Prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it? Crook, panic-shook
Ain't ya? Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Chef and fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'till my foot aching
Full-grown tear type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'till I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
20 minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams
But I'm a dip, I know you must have had it with my rude ass


[Intro: Vince Staples]
What's up, nigga?
Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch?
What's the problem man? Niggas want to hear you rap
Don't nobody care about how you feel
We want raps, nigga

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
My grandma's passin'
But I'm too busy tryin' to get this fuckin' album crackin' too see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it
And all them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want I'm takin' no advice
Nigga, I'm about to relish in this anguish
I'm stressin' over payment, so don't tell me that I made it
Only relatively famous in the midst of a tornado
Misfitted, I'm Clark Gable, I'm not stable
Abrasive as fuck and they all pay me
I'm chucklin', cross-faded in public
Heart racin' so blood is leaked, like I don't give a fuck again, right?

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judging by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga
Night life livin'
Ridin' in the jeep, I'm a side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? It's aiight nigga
Hammer in the left, Freddie what's the price of it?
Ridin' with the whip and I ain't got the license for it
Jill's got me livin like my life is golden
Sittin' on my sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another one, while Mike records it
Pass it to you, what the fuck you starin' at?
Acting like you've never seen a piece of scared cat
Bars hotter than the blocks we be at
Stunt on these niggas, they flop like Divac
See that nigga?
For the time being, I'm a be that nigga
Believe that nigga, you see that nigga?
For the time being I'm a be that nigga
Believe that, nigga


[Intro: Vince Staples]
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man game with my heart attack
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
North north is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Kept the sticky in the Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sole sniff momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at 2 clock trying to guard her loot
Split it with his big roll dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amuck
Road to hell paved with cement, cut the trucks and drugs, toughen up

[Hook: x2]
Alright, okay
If that's how you truly feel about it then

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Vinny Stape, they stupid, think the city safe
Into that little bendy place, head shots, red dot
Block as hot as Denny plates, fed watch, Fed watch
Opinions only pity based, deep in the Civic with the
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot a ditch
Ear-L-double-S, hear shells from the Tec
Hear rim full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address me by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, Ace louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type
Assailant for the paper, living like I met the maker twice
Hit it 'til I'm faded right? Mami, take a hike
And treat it like you fucking shaking dice, bitch

[Hook]


[Hook:]
Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Verse 1:]
It's probably been twelve years since my father left, left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skipped shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk pissy pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
Plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too Black for the White kids and too White for the Blacks
From honor roll to to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained and I'm frightened it's evident
And them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at

[Hook:]
Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

[Verse 2:]
Time lapse, bars rhymin' heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin deep as 96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the potty-mouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom
This is feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance through boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like I like attention
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right, like thanks so much you made my life
Harder and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

[Hook:]
Something sinister to it
Pendulum swinging slow, a degenerate moving
Through the city with criminal stealth, welcome to enemy turf
Harder than immigrants work, golf is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche


[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Said this a hit of liquid heroin
Marilyn Manson channeling, panicking, spar with Anakin
'Til one of us leave in an ambulance
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes
You ain't gon' live till you die
Intelligent bitch on my side
She bitching, I'm spitting habitual lies
I hit her up when my jet land
Got a swisher tucked in my headband
Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eating bagels with no cable on,
Been fucking hoes since when Mase was on,
I hope that Basedgod hears my prayers
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smoking weed on Jay-Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, or feed your girl Cognac,
Meet a bitch, sleepin' with her, feverish, keep a chick,
Met her off Twitter even Schindler keeps a list,
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker
I could pull your bitch with a whisper and diss her,
Dumbass ho
She only dumb cause she love that though
Somewhere getting high reading, Juxtapoz
I hit her up, she come through and watch Adjustment Bureau
Moms love me cause I'm so commercial
I fuck 'em raw cause I know they fertile
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece
Hotel lobbies playing Fur Elise
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me
I said Josh's beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room it's like God is here
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwing tomahawks
At civilians... I'm chillin'

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm on the monitor nigga
She taking it like a champ
And I'm proud of her nigga
I'm on the couch where that loud is burning
I'm shouting, "I don't fuck with you"
Cause I don't, never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma
Open wide for the thermometer
Your cow girl's crotch riding
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga
Bold ass little fuckin' low class villain
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start till the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold in the dark
It's Wolf Gang bitch like you know these paws
Living like it's '62
Spit and grip my genitals
My bitch to split the swisher
My niggas split the residuals

[Outro (x2)]
Aye, marijuana fields
Pot growing, blaring Gil Scott
Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not
For 'em, stop bitching
Stare and get that grill knocked
Open


[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spit, it just burn like six furnaces
Written to fix learning them digits and simultaneously
Dispelling "one-trick-pony" myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing, these niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lackin, like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

[Hook: Casey Veggies (Earl Sweatshirt)]
'87 roof top rising
Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up, sub rocking
Thud knocking niggas teeth loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops (Rolling with that flow swamp)
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)
(Passionless in old Jive clothing with them doors wide open)
(Dim the floor lights focused) Like it's nothing, cause it's nothing, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From that city that's recession-hit
With stress, niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
(Poof) Disappear again, reappear bearded on
Top of a lear steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot Earl
Rawer than the skinned knee cap on the black top
Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the little Nick, nimble, rickrolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids, cheers
Send chills up spines of fat bitches after
Shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it how they
Live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money
Little boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send them for me
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94 would have had them walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me wet 'em if they test you
So it's raging water season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kittens soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy, I don't believe it
But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em free Smalls, off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby Jay, bony niggas spraying Ks
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

[Outro:]
Like it's nothing cause it's nothing, bitch


[Verse 1:]
Gorgeous chrome-plated horse whip
Home-making paintings for poor quality porn flicks
Court adjourned and the verdict's still saucy
Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clinched emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle aged and limp-sticked
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son

[Hook:]
And it always follows Autumn
No home for the weak
No insurance for your pride
Jive, nigga
And it always follows Autumn

[Verse 2:]
I sit in thought 'til the flow is right
Then throw some D on all available open mics
Smoke it right proposing these niggas over wipe
More because I normally toilet bowl with a broken pipe
Shit, the former soloist who flow was sick
The token sober kid stressed so the role was switched
Now Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
Look who's as useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early man, you posers know me as the troll throwing
Moldy donut holes at your grody ho from his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take 'em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over
Tracks damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is, missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good fingerlickin' bitch bet, it's
36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Guess with a few exceptions, yeah, I'm living honest
Except I promised my momma that I would finish college, started chasing profit
Sorry ma, I ain't forget about it but if money evil
I'm hoping that you could see through all the drama and watch me get these dollars
And my ambition burn so hot, it's like I'm bleeding lava
Haters be pleading me to stop but I don't even bother
Though my approach is seeming awkward, I could see it proper
See success and I just see the fact that I don't need a father
Doms hotter than the drop of Harry Potter shit
Pedal to the metal, high-level, full throttle shit
Still searching for a reason why niggas ain't acknowledge this
I'm lost in an era where real shit does not exist
I hate the sway of things, I'm everyday cooling it
I'm getting blazed and laughing at the way they overdoing shit
I'm just a old soul sticking to a newer script
I guess I got to prove this shit, I'm truly too legit to quit

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'd like to send a shout to the fathers that didn't raise us
To every ho who hated, now unable to say much
To critics doing dirty with comments and nigga paid for an apartment
Yesterday off some songs I haven't yet made up
Black Cressida, pay up
Bars going hard as the ashtray where I place guts
Shouts to the eses who paid pesos to play us, riding in the barrio
Huff and puff blowing kush in Huf clothing articles,
Kenny rolling blunts, got us stuck like a barnacle
To the bottom of your shit, ironic cause the audios
As nautical as ships, look momma, look momma
Look, your product is legit, I promise, honest
Karma got me balling up my fist
'Til I demolish your clique, pardon the clips
I am honestly as bomb as it gets, regardless of who talking
I'm farming, harvesting hits
Just me and Domo and lit marijuana to split between two of us
Rocking boxes easy as warming some ramen noodles up
So, searching for a way to state it right
Young, black, and jaded, vision hazy strolling through the night


[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
99 problems all gone in that one joint
And the neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the Contra, Phantom of the Opera
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe tag, don't gag, fag, spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing with his day job
A major born puffy holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit escapers are bent
The label don't like me but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
My niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming amiss
Hey, I'm a fuck the freckles off your bitch, nigga

[Hook: RZA]
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
You know me, drugged out, 'front the telly
I'm couch-drunk, ready to fuck, Tom Petty you bust
Pack loud as that slap across the belly
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? I'm Machi-deli
Scheming on the fontana Camel Crush screaming "Saddle up!"
Like fuck his beef, get your cattle cut, pansy
If the fans only local, why the flights trans-Atlantied?
I'm the rice to the paddies, good nights for the chancellor
The teeth with the gold bright, the light switch's mad at us
Snapchatted panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
Hired for life because po-lice is in back of us
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially
Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep

[Hook]


[Verse 1: SK Laflare]
Baby girl, what you want to do?
Hop in this 'Cedes girl
She like where we going to
A new life, new world
Pop that molly, we hard-body
Glocks hot as Kemosabe
He said that he wanted beef
So we fed him hollows and got it popping
Fear and ego is the enemy
You ain't got to pretend with me.
I need the wool, I'mma skin the sheep
And take the bull, skin it to the meat
You full of shit, we in too deep
I do this, she knew the deet
Like two feet, Flare two time
She wanna kick it like Bruce Lee
Brought you in, I'll take you out
Ball like Tim then I weighed it out
It's no work, we sling through droughts
The life of me, I'm just hanging out
Don't get comfortable and lay on the couch
I don't wanna see your ass laying down
Pop that pussy, twerk some
Cause most of these bitches work for nothing
Paid your dues, while you're Paid In Full
I can't wait to win, you wait to lose
Your mind of a failure, hate rules
When you settle for what you hate to do
I go the extra mile, I'm with the extras
Extended clips shoot through your necklace
Leave you breathless, that tec is restless
Cause All My Children need the best, bitch
I need that Rothschild money, the top is sunny
I seen the light, and you blocked it from me
But I found my way to the top, I'm coming
Cause I smack that bass like a rockstar drummer

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm a problem to niggas
Pop artillery, the carbonates with him
Starving to hit 'em, spar with a nigga
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all in a minute
It's the ticket-dodging aristocrat
New bitch, whip with the system slaps
Mister slide in and skimp the sack
Nigga hit the function with a pick and ax
My nigga miss me with the bullshit
Right here, right ear got a Pesto blunt
Why that shit got a young nigga Velcro stuck
Why your bitch go down when the cess go up
Hard as arm services, y'all might have heard of him
Escobarbarian, best call the lawyers up
Bruh, the broad Aryan, know the squad loiterers
Not with the grain and these bitch niggas' wishes
Dealt with addiction, fell for the bitch with the
Pale butter skin who just packed up and dipped
In the land of the rent-less, stand with my chips
In a stack and a grin, fuck 'em


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
After filling my reputation of whore beaters
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberry's on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's or Domino's (Fuck it, whatever, um)
Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile
It's Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Squadron full of some lost souls
Sergeant of all, it's autumn and Nak just nollied a pothole
Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the fox holes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 p.m. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented stupid as the group is
Only slightly, write precise to get a pussy nigga two chins
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga


[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into, and I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you, I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just driftin', I'm not complainin'
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket, and this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the laundry
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that

[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Iâm coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
Iâll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming, donât cry
You know I canât live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But Iâd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly please, palm, no marijuana trees
Yo hickeys on my aorta and tattoos you could only see
When Iâm playing surfboarder, put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you thinkâs cool
They thought me soft in High School, thank God Iâm jagged
Forgot you donât like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when Iâm aiming my gun
And whyâs his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammyâs and gold
Polka dots on my brit, Iâm not supposed to be stunting
Itâs all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep
But Iâm just jet-lagged is all, and restless

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving youâs a little different I donât like you a lot
I meanâ¦fuck

[Outro]
I donât know what weâre about
What good is West Coast weather if youâre bi-polar?
If Iâma need this sweater
Iâd rather be where itâs cold
Where it snows
I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls
I know theyâre coming in droves
Youâll only miss when it goes
(Yeah, I think thatâs it)
When it goesâ¦..


Salmon skin Band-Aid help with recovery
Diction buttery, grass depending
Your nigga was switching passed depending on where the rudder swings
Snapping like the shutter speed, pucker up, kiss of death
Tell your men to hit the deck or hit the dirt
Killing who you sinning first, verse wintergreen spit it, show 'em that I meant it
Ho, I'm rolling with my niggas, find a gold and call the chemist
Show up solo to the scrimmage, throw a brick and pour the Henny
Don't defend it, it's useless nigga
Up to my wrist in the cooler gripping the brew in this music shit
For Versace suicidal, I hit the Jake through the rifle
And tell her open that mouth for deposit, leave the bank broke
Sliding in, she smiling and fidgeting, pull my face close
Streaming down the street from what 'roma was stank though
Product of the villainy, product capable, plainclothes
Rhyme with no niggas who probably was gonna remain broke


[Intro: Tyler the Creator]
Nahh no, nahh nahh fuck that
Niggas think cause you fuckin' made Chum and got all personal
That niggas won't go back to that old fuckin' 2010 shit
About talkin' 'bout fuckin' everything all
No fuck that nigga I got you
Fuck that

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then dash
To Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying that hotter wind in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and fileted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis and antagonists Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fuck in cattle brands, wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea kettle songs

[Hook: Tyler the Creator]
Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
50 K for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck,
Nigga it's the mutherfuckin'
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah, the Misadventures of a shit talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose to spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick
Thought out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

[Hook: Tyler the Creator]
Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the block, looking like I ain't make
A quarter million off of socks, nigga, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G


[Wiki:]
Nineteen, still gettin' kicked out the crib
Ripped off my bib, spit out my food, hiccup and piss
Urine burnin', I could smell the liquor in this
Cats always tryna' pick up the fist
Duff this dude out
Rappers stoop just to get to your crib
Now it's like who's face? who's warped? too sauced
Distort thoughts, on my corpse on the asphalt
Back when I'd slack more, rock my slacks or my ass
Everytime, I rap I blast-off
Back when I catch Cor', I always had Sports
Dippin' on cops in my track shorts
So tell my mom I had to make it right
I lie every night about the lime-light so I could lie at night
And tell my Pops' I gotta' take advice
Keep my head screwed on tight, abuse these mics
See me, I'm the contusion type
A cat to smack a mic and catch my fuckin' hair when I'm losing height
Ratking, never losing hype, no
It's Ratking and I do it right
Ratking, yeah, I do it nice, woah

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Bitch, I skated before I rapped, if you take me before your captain
Bet twenty hots on your Daddy
[?], probably cold and passive
Cause' Pops' was the one that got to me
Feeling down like he passed it and when I'm cornered, it's action
I was kinda' out the game, I'ma put the quarter right back in the slot
In 09', we took the 7 to the Dussy 17 to the block
Bitch, if yo' nigga had Supreme, we was the reason he copped it
And nowadays, I'm on the hunt for lyrics to box with
And some pretty bitches that ain't trip if it's a hit and run
I got the gold cause' I don't do the crying bro
She Mario, I'm tryna' keep the whining to a minimum
Piggies come, bet i'm splittin' quicker than I finish rum
Find me some Indica, nuggets on my fingers and my shirt like they was chicken crumbs
The room spinnin', finna' yak if I don't hit the blunt
Got the chin wagon, slim chances of me getting up
After this, mind in the trash next to where my fuckin' passion went
Doc's fanatics, half-a-Xanax when I'm traveling six hours or more
Brick out on the tour, got kicked out of the morgue
Spit cattle manure shit, shit, rally the Horsemen
Tally the corpses


[Earl:]
Intercepting a fifth of whisky
And neckin it 'til I'm dizzy
I never was defenseless
I never hugged a fence
I pick a side and trust in it
Stomach full of drugs and shit
My niggas on some other cleanse
Sunday binge, Monday
Then another 6 days back to Sunday when it's done again
And the pants better be creased on my corpse
If you need that, run until the street lights off
Back got bigger, got the team strapped on
And you thought it was magic
But that's just the difference
Nigga my team is magicians
We think of the shit that we want then we get it
Look I got hoes in my britches
Big up Dill and Britches, pro part coming soon
Thought you knew this my nigga
It's crackin like french tips
Just checkin and balances
And checks and salaries
Testing my friendships
Cause niggas get sour of this
Rap shit got the best of me
I threw the rest off the balcony
Shoutout Da$H and Retchy
I know yo bitch check for me
So much for chivalry
So long to every bitch tryna get intimate
I'm in my 20s now
Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdained from the loss since a fucking child
Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks
We taking it all and we running out
Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho
Put your face in your palm when I come around ya
Tell mom I'mma get a gun
If I get too popular
I'm just being honest with it
Tell her:
Stop whining
It ain't no mo problems
I'm the best out of all these niggas
I'm just home when you speaking
Ain't no home for the weekend
No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping
I'm here and I'm there
And I'm up and I'm down
And I'm low and I'm peakin
It's cold in the deep end

Bitch nigga, we the train
If you see 'em wave
Ain't no bitch in my DNA
[x2]

[Na'kel:]
Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day
Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays
My bro left today, fuck
Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that
I ain't seen us in years
And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack
Your momma heart intact
We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that
I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back
A house on the hill with a big ass grill
We could have a boxing match
Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that
I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that
I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that
When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me
Right next to grandmammy, and the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy


Chef Sweaty braising your faculty
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing
That's the trace of me nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Just trying to see an end and some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans
Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal
Staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August
In the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell
And I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith they never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet

[x2:]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run, don't chase me

Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
As hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born readily
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so Iâm a fluid brawler
Rain checkinâ on ya product, never (im)'pressing papa
Out the toaster, I gotta focus on my family problems
Shrunk and widened up with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt cause I canât keep a date or put personal time in
A reverse of the times when my face didnât surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Canât put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, Iâm stupid for tryinâ
Still this nigga too busy wildinâ

[x2:]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po
When I run, don't chase me


Alright
Uh, uh, uh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sow
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focus on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, nigga, shit
Bitch

Good grief, I been reaping what I sow
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I'm fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Mama taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar
When you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back


[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home
I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors
Guess he isnât home
Probably âcause that fucking faith I didnât show
Skippin church, flip the work
Hit the dirt, like Tommy run it bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasnât in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasnât hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty D-A dollar top lotto picks
Promise that I am not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my mother fucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a mother fucking end
Trend dodging, keep a bitch by me
Back roll
Garbage bag full of xans
Teach myself to rap and steal nigga
Cash is in hand
Packs get vac sealed
Like the Tin Man
Cardiac Stillness
Cardiac still missing

Donât know where Iâm going, donât know where I been
Never trust these hoes, donât even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups
Donât know where Iâm going, donât know where I been
Never trust these hoes, donât even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, fucking with some grown ups

[Earl Sweatshirt & Da$h:]
My mama wonder why it never seem to reach
See my Daddy in the way I'm acting
And my facial features
Just trying to put you on
Dog I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it
Nigga Iâm a dog
Tell her hit or miss me with the fucking monologue
Lord I can't fight it
Know I'm tryna brawl
Get a copper hauled off
I'm the type of nigga that you cop your raw off
Popping hoes off
Grab the board and these niggas call charge
Chain switches jerseys like it's all star
Press the OnStar
Think it's all lost


Foot and hand on the gates
We was jumping, oh fuck, I'm like quicksand in my ways
Was always stuck and I'm stuck until an ambulance came
The first time I changed fast through Los Angeles lanes
And my bitch say the spliff take the soul from me
And the clique tight-knit, it's like the 'lo rugby
Beat the fuckin beat up like it stole from me
You can talk to Clancy you need a feature, or quote from me
I'm off the lancy, I reek of reefer and show money
It's Early running with niggas, who cold running shit
The wins like lotion, he get it he go rub 'em in
Critics pretend to get it and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother
Just grab a glass and pour up some cold white wine
And a Colt 45 in it, you know how I get it
I'm toasted myself and a toast to all my niggas
And there ain't no time limit, I'm toasted as hell
And I gotta jot it quick cause I can't focus so well

And now, a formal introduction


Fresh out the belly of the island
Into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road
I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me
I thought the fodder was pretty
So I approached her
My first apartment was
Really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late
I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave
Now you in the industry ocean
And missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish
Home gets distant
We working I'm on the road again
Cold and his spirits is
Bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits
And the crib mirror mirror
Let me hear why the niggas
That's the peers see and hear us
Then mimmick the fucking motions man
Keep the circle closed
Let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen
The rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker
It help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit
Who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Never trying me, I'm diving
Falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems I don't holler
Rather fix 'em by myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you
This the shit to yell

This the shit right
Keep your chin high up
Cause when she ain't fucking with you
Then her friend might
Let you get up inside yup
Let this shit ride
You don't get it rocking
Like we do on this side nigga

I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily


Get your lady
Cop, piff, inhale & cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick & playing cautious

Imma show you how it's done right nigga
Drop this when the sunlight gone
Better run right home when the sky turn black
Screaming "fuck five-0" til my line go flat
In that ash-gray beamer we'll be callin that the pigeon coupe
Jack knife bitches to the couches in they living rooms
Ask who the best and I doubt that they picking you
Back like how I need to style, I invented you
Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the cho-cha stanky
Listening to Pre, getting dome while I lane switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky of a
Poster child, you're supposed to hate me
Bold & wild, you broke and angry, my nigga
Name getting bigger than the difference between us
Niggas is fake, I limit the features I give 'em
Sweat (sweat) shirt (shirt)
You know you famous when the niggas that surround you switch
And if they hating in a passive tense, now they hounding dick
And you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of 100 fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at, when they want a pound & a pic
Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trousers thick
I said sweat (sweat), shirt (shirt)
You can tell the Reaper Imma meet em when he sent for me
With a cleaver, & a .30, and some twisted weed
I pick one, and let the crimson leak, nigga

Get your lady
Cop, piff, inhale & cough
Rip the label off this
Picked the road that got twists
I'm holding my dick & playing cautious

You used to say you like violins
And your lifestyle depend on me
And I know it's night time when you get lonely
And tell all your little friends how that bitch stole me
And despite all the facts that you got phony
You gonna tell them bout the night that you exposed me
For the bastard I was
And how I probably smashed every bitch that I passed in the club
And the last couple months was the worst
Cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months
That we had as a couple
My abscence, a fuss
Was a problem that we ain't ever really get to solve
We just smashed & we scuffled
Tryna keep it calm but I snap at you
Now you're taking all your property back & it's obvious that
That apart from the fact that we fuck & it's bomb
And I hate when you home
And when I'm gone I don't call cause you nag
Man I brought you some shit
And I bought you some shit
What you offering here?
What the fuck you offering here?


[cough]
Yo I gotta stop smoking backwoods
"How you doing?" And what's your motive, ho?
I only trust these bitches bout as far as I can throw em
Trying to pay my momma rent, figure that's just what I owe her
I been trouble since I tumbled out that stroller
Strollin easy down this narrow path, beefin' with your scary ass
'Preme got my little niggas cheesing off the cherry ad
And nigga that's a great lunch, poppa swamp and stomping with the skate fucks
Heavy handing tracks until the day the fucking train come
Raised up where every mouth that speak the truth get taped shut
Peep the evening news my nigga, we don't do the same stuff
Kiwis couldn't take us, boy im jogging around these bases
Niggas pitches need to change, I separated from my main one
It's just another day, another nigga's bitch to face fuck
I been like this since the Motorola Razr
What a bastard that baby was, little mad nigga missing dad
Never praying much
Right around the same time his grandmama drank a bunch
Take the bus, take a niggas seat like it was made for me
I got this nigga Da$h with me
He sipping on some maple leaf
I'm only happy when there's static in the air cause the fair weather fake to me
Living in the scope, hairs crossed like adjacent streets
Dare a nigga think it's sweet, never, bitches funny boy, 
you berries And you honey for the bear that's here to tear and eat
Run a niggas pockets like some errands make it hasty
Hope the sheriff keep away from me


[Vince Staples:]
Soon as I catch the vibe tell 'em to fetch the hearse
Shorty Iâm pressin' lines lifting the Lauren shirt
Tell her to bless the girth if she with it
Iâm in that kitchen, wrist water whippin'
Sike nigga, I donât do that
Niggas get blue blacked and blown away
Wessons making Mexicans wetbacks like orale
Okay, Iâm on to something
Momma should've told you itâd be days like this
Itâs just a tale from the crip
Iâm on my sÃ©ance shit, Iâm tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch
A lot of lotto picks lost in this game called rap
I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm
Ainât nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you played me for a pawn
Shorty I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen to what the pastor say

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
It's golf on that.. bitch, it's golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tall boy, Jehovah ainât call back
And yaâll still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street
In the different color McGrady's, that first grader was me
Now my fist full of splifs and an old baker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
Iâm taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my momma I been limiting my features
Filling swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy k brought the matches
Put your body down in water like a Lipton tea bag is
Switch to different fucking whip to let them piggies speed passed em
It's the rats, try and get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou, if I'm on a track niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
50's in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gone pop it when itâs danger round
Fingertips to tapers, now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now


[Verse 1: Earl]
Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But something was always missing like six digits
Lucky seven probably poppa
Little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so
David hit the pavement with his grapple rap
Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am popping like a snapping crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milking cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezing, boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split
Don't act surprised, agree with it
The Gang of Wolves and creeps and Crips
Is deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boasting
Bragging tell this faggots to stop nagging
Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it.. Troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirting with Uncle Mervin
Fucking y'all with no lubricant go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearing nothing but they fucking blast with their matching turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swerving
Hitting curbs and blasting Erick Sermon drunk off English Bourbon
I'm stealing purses raping nurses I'm a quick consierge
And treat the beat like sanitized nazi pussies, I'm a German
I'm squirting while I'm masturbating and regurgitating
From eating Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were serving
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like it's convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fucking ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang like they're filming Twilight in this bitch

[Verse 3: Earl]
I'm back on my sixty six six shit
Flowing like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers now you ain't laughing, huh

[Verse 4: Tyler]
Bitch you're barely breathing leaving on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowing like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed of her arm and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fucking awesome spitting box of trees, got you niggas
Shaking like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironing you niggas now it's time to start some shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl lying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out, sharpen it
Stab him, put a arch on it, pour unleaded gas on him
Get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it


Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut crashin' while
Jackin' off to bufferin' vids of Asher Roth eatin' apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets and laugh it off
Twisted sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screamin', bitch: you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin"
Puts the pieces of decomposin' bodies in plastic
Puts 'em in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fuckin' cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, you dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, askin' where her ass go
In my room, redefinin' the meanin' of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's OF buttercup: go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade a thong, my dick is havin' guts for lunch
As well as supper; then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard, fuckin' nosey neighbors notice somethings up
"What you doin'?" Nothin' much, squish out some other stuff
Gotta fuckin' bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

[Verse 2]
Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hatin' but them faggots is a lotta talk
Cotton soft pussy them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails, fuckin' toss one in your apartment dog
Wolf Gang we ain't barkin', nah
Try talkin' on a blog with your fuckin' arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter "We're sorry, but papa's gone... bitch"


[Hook]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull 'em like a tutor, in fact
I got one in the front and two in the back
And the bitches keep screaming "Odd Future is back"

[Verse 1]
Wolf with a T-Rex cock, less talk
While I invest stock in wet rock
Smoke with all the big bitches bumping "Bedrock"
Sub in the truck, thumpin' up against the dead cops
And pop it like I tossed a match in the engine
And go harder than a fucking crack intervention
Clown of the class and the last to attend it
Big Earl make you fags stand at attention
Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking general
Catch 'em where them slap, slash, stab bitch ass niggas go
Girl, you ain't even gotta ask cause you finna know
Why this Playboy so sticky in this centerfold
Sticky what my niggas blow, icky Earl finish foes
Hit 'em low, litter them with Chronicles of Riddick bows
Chronic in the spliff to the dome, got my system slow
Saw 'em walking out, ask them niggas what they sprinting fo'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vince Staples]
Black Ted Bundy sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She freaked with dick to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped of a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash her where we hide the marijuana and the condoms
"Hey, what's that?" Don't touch it or even fucking look
You are Fantasia and the body bag's a fucking book

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo Vince, let me tell you 'bout these hoes I met last night
They thought I was cute 'til I asked what that ass like
Damn right, red light, ran right through it
"You don't even have your permit, what the fuck are you doing?"
Maybe if you shut the fuck up, we'd be cruising
And you wouldn't be sitting, boohooing 'bout your bruises
But no, you wanna be Miss Fuck-with-the-Music
I'm zoning on Relapse, she's sliding on Blueprint
Three seconds it takes for her to turn blue
With my hands around her throat, her arms stopped moving
Pulse stops too, in the back, look confused
As I turn to tell them both not to do shit stupid
Red, white, blue lights in the rear-view, shit
Swerved to the shoulder, tell them both no moving
Sit down in the back, cause the windows tinted
As I rolled down mine to forge a new friendship
"Aren't you a little too young to be driving?"
Look Officer, I'm just tryna get home
"Get out the fucking car with your license and registration"
I ain't getting outta shit, you're starting to try my patience
Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

[Outro]
All the bad bitches boo when you rap
I can teach you how to pull âem like a tutor, in fact
A one dead in the front, dead cop in the back
And two live bitches screaming "Odd Future is back"


[Intro]
Aw, nigga thought he killed me?
Alright, that's cool, we'll see

[Verse 1]
Strict top of the crop shit
Crushin' muthafuckas like moths in a mosh pit
Dollar cents, since shit, sense I ain't lost it
It's in a fuckin' jar with guitar picks and bar spit
Bar spat, past tense, warriors of radness
Fuck lame, get it through your brain like dad's dick
Go ahead, stab a friend, tell him that I'm back, bitch
Earl leave bastards with milkiest asses
Take a firm standin', nod on the tracklist
Earl half the reason the reviews fantastic
Niggas gettin' comfy on the Couch, I ain't havin' it
Kickin' gluteus maximus, killin' niggas on accident

[Hook]
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, I'mma kill 'em all
Just watch, off 'em

[Verse 2]
Off 'em, no off days, no debates, bitch
Box logo, switchblade and cocaine
In my back pocket, take Jade on vacation
The hotel switch from Heartbreak to Bates quick
Rippin' out braids with bare hands amazes
The crowd, go crazy, hands raised, I'm laced with
Swag by the eighth in case you wanna taste it
Faggots wear Prada, Satan wears RMK shit
Hell's angel, crack Christ 'cross the face
With erasers and use Based God as his replacement
Super Saiyan with ruthless slayings
Eat puss, sweet puss got my tooth decayin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now pan the cameras back to me and Pamela's
Amateur threesome with Hannah Montana's manager
And Miley feedin' me sandwiches for my stamina
And Santa's in the back laughin' cause my back's crampin' up
Mrs. Claus trippin' balls, think she had enough
And by enough I mean we dope as fuck, she had a gram of us
Flyer than your man because I'm lampin' up
At the airport smokin' hash with all the fuckin' baggage handlers
Flowin' like the muthafuckin' aqueducts
Odd Future Wolf Gang, fag damagers, bitch, eat a dick


[Verse 1]
Ma said "Wake up son, good morning"
I rolled outta bed, greeted mama with a yawn then
Paused to scratch an itch and went, down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I payed my thoughts no attention
Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking her MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say, that I fucking hate you, but

[Verse 2]
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life, rushing through my body
But you got a guy, it's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four
Not like a family of four, just like.. fuck it
You'll never listen to this shit anyways, fuck you, bitch

[Verse 3]
She said "You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador"
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple stores
The basement light is darkened and the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me murder spree, surges on with the next bitch
Tombstones read RIP cause it's pieces they rest in


[Verse 1: Earl]
Started thinking about a normal life, it got me suicidal
Standing in the kitchen with a noose and a rifle
Hang or bang hockin' lugees in a bible
Dancing with the Devil tonight's our first recital
His hands on my hips he take control of my movement
A couple of minutes pass and I don't know what I'm doin'
Just dance to the music so nobody will laugh at me
But the fucking voices in my head keep asking me
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
I live all over my roomie's a bum
Fuck a bitch never sober virgin bitch nun
Sound like she dying when that virgin bitch cum
My used penis beats on this virgin bitch drums
She askin' me to dance I ask for my pants
Ended up with an arguement sirens, ambulance
Scratch her off my list, situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hatin' the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillin's all through my vampire teeth saber
(Ahh, Jesus, please) She screams for her savior
A nun with a bum fuck you bitch better pay up
I need to eat, place to sleep, new shoes, aging feet
Alligator hair heat Gatorade made her sweet

[Verse 3: Earl]
Bitter sweet seven fist fightin' with a reverend
Bless sessions niggas fresh as Crest breath is
Devil in my chest I inhale more cess then
Place one missed call to heaven
You ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight


[Verse 1:]
Welcome back to class, bitch, grab on to your glasses
Odd Future leaving even niggas in past tense
Style is patent, the measures is drastic
Either that or they 4: 4, some call them fantastic
She called me fantastic, I called her a fat bitch
Still kill the pussy, put the cat in a casket
The funeral service was fucking worthless, so I said a couple words at it
Didn't know her but I'm confirming that she sure gurgled dick
The Odd nigga with a spoon in your danimals
As hungry as a cannibal, trapped in a van of cantaloupes
Harder than granite, hoes know I'm coming
With the grand force of Van Damme's fist in a damn cannon so
Fans catch us on Animal Planet, tracking hoes
And attacking faster than foes can change the channel, whoa
My dick hates sweaters so she jack it slow
The aftermath proves to be smoother than hair relaxer, oh

[Hook:]
Wave high to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent
Say hi to the Ritalin regiment
Double S shit, swastikas on the letterman, bitch
Hungry wolves at the door, bitch, let us in
Kill 'em all, O.F. is what I represent

[Verse 2:]
Took the van, went snatch her
Oh, you wanna snap this grass? Snap your fucking jabba
Wocky, she's a dancer, walkie-talkie Ace for back up like fag
I got class and can't take this bitch to math, what
Tell the fucking teacher that this burlap sack is filled
With snacks for after class for the whole class, to snack up
Yeah, right, get over here faster
Cause Earl's a pro rapper but amateur kidnapper

[Tyler:]
Earl, goddammit, I'm still in my damn pajamas
Waiting on mom to bring me the Aspirin from a trampoline jump
And if I pick her up, I'm humping and I'm fucking with no lubricant
I'm using spit, piss, vaseline or something, how old is she?
(Seventeen) This bitch is underage
But I'll have her face off tied and Nicholas Cage
But anyway, give me cash fag, cause I'm low on gas
Aww fuck it, 'bout to jack off, go catch a fucking cab
No I'm not lying when I say that brother's all I have
But if you're not dying don't fucking bother to call me back, I'm sleep

[Hook]

[Bridge: x2]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Odd Future here to steer you to what the fuck's cool
Fuck rules, skate life, rape, write, repeat twice
Odd Future young enough to get your priest mouth drool

[Verse 3:]
I don't give a fuck, like a senior citizen
Shit and run back to the lab, need assistance from
Sister with the biggest bumbaclot girls
I'm around calves big cause they run a lot and scream, oh
Pay him some attention, he's smart and he's genius
He ain't touching me like Martin Sheen's penis
Y'all niggas ain't clean as my team is meanest
Hitting amputees in the knees, Jesus
Please, just peep the Crystal Method where
I take a fucking beat, strip it naked then I wreck it
It's no question, Sweatshirt's O.F
And you can tell by the chiseled horns on my forehead bitch
Hammerhat flyer than a bag of ass
And Jane's a fucking acrobat, I'll flip her on a mattress
Last straw, fuck that, I'm who broke the camel's back
Say you want that dope shit, welcome to Satan's cabbage patch, bitch

[Outro:]
Told you he can rap, dumb muthafucka


[Verse 1]
It's Earl, Mr. Early Bird, gets them girls with curvy curves
Skate mental truck, smack a faggot in his shirley temple
Your rhymes rentals, give 'em back to they owners
At the end of the bar, I spit with the permanents
Learn I'm a curb stoppin' person
Like third strike verdict droppin' jaw droppin' verses
This bigger lips in person, nigga spits some ball's Ernie shit
Furnish the flow until my pockets green, Kermit's dick
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, ho
The Ms. Piggy's with a string in they ass
I control like 'em like your eyes when I'm takin' a glass
So if you thinkin' 'bout this then stop thinkin' it fast
Cause my wolves ten deep and they knuckles is brass, bitch

[Hook]
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Wait, where you goin', what you doin' tonight?
Just wanna know what you doin', come back
Tell your boyfriend that's a bat and this a migrane
Don't ask why my jeans splattered with these white stains
Where you goin', what you doin' tonight?
Stop runnin', where you goin', what you doin'?

[Verse 2]
It's Earl, Mr. Lateshift Rapist in trainin'
Who edge 'bout as straight as some clay-closet gay dick
Ray say hey Earl's a real charming racist
Your birthday day, have some KK cake bitch
Habit have it, grab it fast and attack it, faggot
I'm above average like I'm rappin' in the attic, yeah
I'm crouched in the basement shoutin' "Couch" is the greatest hit
Dirty as the anus is, fans stand in rain for this
They even stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt
Fans probably stand in sleet season 'til they fuckin' feet bleedin'
Hail and fuckin' snow in hell with fuckin' coats
Probably wear more layers, there's only one Sweatshirt
He make 'em bow down 'til they muthafuckin' necks hurt

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mr. Deerskin Moccasins is on the fuckin' stalk again
Followin' and stalkin' all them larchmont soccer chicks
Choppin' limbs, knawin' legs, through they fuckin' stockings
Him his grandfather sweatshirt, clockin' all them cardigans
Product of popped rubbers and pops that did not love us
So when I leave home keep my heart on the top cupboard
So I will not stutter when I'm shoutin' fuck you, son
Wolf Gang 'bout it, we ain't waitin' 'til the moon come
Woo son, the moonshine got feelin' loose
As the puss of a whore who's used to abuse
My screws pretty loose mind fucked like the hair-doos
Of doo-doo mamas, dude I will bear jew you
You unripe fruit dudes is crews to chew through
My niggas wash 'em down with a fat carton of yoo-hoo
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All fuck 'em all
No lube, it's the crew to get use to, faggot


[ThatNiggaTaj]
Goddamn!!

[Intro: Taco and Tyler]
What up Tyler? (What up nigga? Hanging out)
What're you looking at? (Nigga, shit, fucking shit)
Let me see, who the fuck is this? (That dude? Oh, this dude?)
Look at his forehead

[Verse: Tyler the Creator]
This my little brother on my mother's side, our father died
He was living with my grandmother on the North side of Sacramento
But this faggot just visiting, he's settling in
He can't wait to start meddling and doing the evil shit we do
(Does he skate?) Yeah, he skate too
(Man, this nigga ugly) And he raps, ooh
This the newest Wolf Gang member
And he.. (What's his name?) Earl

[Outro: Taco and Tyler]
Nigga, this nigga's forehead is so fucking big
This nigga, look at this fucking nigga's lips, dog
This nigga's lips look like a split sundae
Yo, this nigga's line is bended! (That's fucked up)
Yo, this nigga, this nigga look like an African poet (Earl, say something)
Yo, this nigga's forehead looks like a fucking big ass nooch
(Nigga, don't be nervous nigga, say something, trust me guys, he can rap)
He a bitch! (Just say something
Nigga, don't be a bitch nigga, say something)
Nigga, rap, you fucking suck probably
(Trust me guys, he can rap, just say something)


[Earl Sweatshirt:]
Ahh, fuck, what time is it? Six, fuck, who needs to be up this early?

[Earl Sweatshirt:]

[Earl Sweatshirt:]

[Mom:]

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
What?
[Mom:]
"Earl, wake the fuck up, you faggot!
[Earl Sweatshirt:]
How 'bout you shut the fuck up, mom?


(Johnny Juliano)
(Cardo got ranks)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib
It was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Play some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you were out of town
Nigga like Biggie heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got LA unified, you're better off committing suicide
Teachers ain't testin' us
See I know how it feel to be platinum plus
Niggas is jealous of you so they try to wrap you up
Tat you up, but it's OVO blood money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catchin' the bus
Dark fame is a mothafucka
Do a nigga four favors, when you canât do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny's house
Leave you lyin' like Fif'
How a nigga supposed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walk around the crib like..
Why a nigga canât live? Get this money, fuck these bitches
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like
We can pass these motherfuckin' straps like a physical
This my city, nigga everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four pounds
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hope I ain't gotta show it
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Yo 40 I'm fucked up

[Drake:]
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

[Drake:]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin'
Thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearing your true colors to every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they was skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Nobody's even hearin' it on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Drake:]
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100

Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill, nigga
Know how it feel when you're missin' your nigga though
Can't think so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figueroa
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog's name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with me
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
LA niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter dawg cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Drake:]
Y'all better not come to my studio wit' that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral wit' that fake shit
Y'all better off realizing there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever ask is keep it 8 more than 92 with me, 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100, yeah, 100
All I ever ask is 100


[Verse 1:]
I got these freak hoes clappin' their hands, stompin' their feet
Every now and then they put their mouth on me
But these days a G like me can't even call it
They ride dick until you sleep and then go through your wallet
Fake ass, bitch ass, thot ass, slut ass hoes
Workin' in secret Sunday, don't even wipe that pole
Dirty bitch, you done had a dick in every one of your holes
You a trick, you ain't shit and everybody knows
Bitch you don't even wash your rag
Let a nigga smash and you don't even wash your ass
Fuck you mean? You 'bout to go home and take a shower
That mean that pussy 'bout to be funky for a whole 'nother hour
Every night you let a new nigga nut in your shit
How you suck a nigga's dick with that cut on your lip?
You freak bitch, your baby daddy in the county doin' burpies
And you gave that nigga herpes

[Hook:]
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit

[Verse 2:]
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and sluts
She asked to hold 500, I let her hold deez nuts
Bitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps
Talkin' bout eatin' groceries, bitch you on food stamps
You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother, he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunters
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jumpers
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick
I hit her with a hashtag like (Bitch you ain't shit)

[Hook:]
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Bitch you ain't shit, bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Bitch you ain't shit


[Game & Sha Sha:]
I just want you to come home
No matter if it's late at night
(I hear you talking)
I know you saying you working
But baby boy this feeling ain't right
(I'm just out here tryna get my money you know that)
Fuck that we got enough houses, enough cars
You done bought me enough jewelry
Tired of your shit my nigga you hitting
(You know I be at the studio and shit)
Nigga you lying, who you trying to run that game on?
Who you think I am? I'm not one of these thots you met at Playhouse
(I didn't say that)
I just rode by nigga, you wasn't at Dre house
Parked my shit at Ye house and hopped in the uber
Jayceon stop lying you fucking think I'm stupid
Nah look ain't nobody say that
You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppes you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that [concord?], put you in that Tom Ford
All this arguing I ain't got no time for it
You call my phone like fifty times
Don't do no shit like that
I was just fucking them girls
I was gon' get right back

[Eric Bellinger:]
Spinning around, spinning around
Spinning around, spinning around
It's the same old, we be going through the same old
Spinning around, spinning around
Pulling them down, taking them down
It's the same old, niggas get tired of the same old

[Game & Sha Sha:]
Nigga you strapping up?
Yeah I'm strapping up, shit you acting up?
Yeah I'm acting up, nigga
You not gon' keep on playing me
You not gon' keep on playing me
Is it gon' be this bitch or your family?
I'll kill that bitch whole family (I fucking hate you!)
What your crazy ass shooting in the house for?
What yo dumbass ruining the house for?And what time you get home anyway?
Shit, about four
And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for
I don't give a fuck, thug life I'm an outlaw
And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call
Scrolling through my iPhone looking for my sidechick
This bitch always flipping pushing buttons like a sidekick
That's when I hop in my Jeep and pull it out the toxic
And while you gone, guess what?
I'll be bouncing on that sidedick, nigga

[Eric Bellinger & Sha Sha:]
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
I guess you thought they stopped making real niggas when they made you
Shit, they stop making them, they stop making them
Guess she thought they stopped making real bitches when they made you
Shit, there's a few in the room and a couple in the Wraith too

[Q-Tip:]
Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch to ever grace to pair of shoes
And if you are unable to find better you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like the Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl I cut the cord from her navel

[Eric Bellinger & Q-Tip:]
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round
I guess it's just the way it goes down
Love is like a merry go round
It all goes to game


[Intro - The Game:]
They say it started in the East where the apple was
But out West we be throwing them apples up
They say them Fruit Town niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Tree Top niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Grape Street niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Bounty Hunter niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them 6-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Cedar Block niggas gon' ride tonight
Them 1-9-0 niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Timberland niggas gon' ride tonight
They say them Campanella niggas gon' ride tonight
Who gon' ride tonight, who gon' die tonight
Started with a dollar and a dream
Started with a dollar and a dream

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
We did it for the West, motherfucker, like Kanye
Niggas get stretched out on [?]
Got three thousand stacks, I ain't talking 'bout Andre
I put it on your head, I ain't talking no toupee
See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on his trigger like ain't no more toothpaste
(You ain't gon' do shit) Bitch, of course I is
You want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did
I got that weight foundry, talking 'bout the Porsche out here
You in the nosebleeds, come down to where the cross-eyed is
How a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho
Bag, any bitch walking with a solo swag
You think you ballin' in that four do' Jag? Nah
In Tom Fords with a MK bag? nah
Give you a bird's eye view of the streets
Nigga, welcome to Compton, take you in Carson next week
Ab-Soul!

[Hook - The Game:]
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!

[Verse 2 - Ab-Soul:]
I was fathered by the bastards
Pardon my mannerisms
The Curtiss magnet that managed without the metal with him
How the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it
I put that on Leetwood, I ain't lying one sentence
Bitch, I started with a dollar and a dream
We went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta
For a couple quarters to a baby hustling something major
We had to grow up sooner or later, but
I'm so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee
Carson across my belly, I prove you lost already
Roccett my big brother, Bishop let the door crack
Game took me on my first tour, now look where we at
In the studio getting paid to reflect on that
Documenting true facts
Not to mention this the Documentary 2 too
You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it's more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I'll wait
Yeah, that's what I thought, I'm the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It's Top Dawg, all I'm missing is the red hat
But don't question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I'm guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw all my fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I'm saying
The game ain't changed, we still changing the game
Soul!

[Hook - Game:]
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!

[Verse 3 - The Game:]
My first album was a set up
I was the little nigga Pac was talking to
When he said "keep your head up"
Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise
Move the Yay or kiss the sky, for having dreams that 50 died
Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it
Say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me babbling ghost cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
It's wise to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me, yeah
Out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut

[Hook - Game:]
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Look at me now, look at me now)
Started with a dollar and a dream!


[Intro - Dr. Dre:]
Damn, Will.I.am, my nigga. It's your boy Dre
Yo, I don't think people know that you know how to take it to the streets

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Check it out now, check it out now
Check it out, uh-huh
It's like that, yeah, it's like that now
It's like that, uh-huh, it's like that now
A black.45, I gotta put it on
That chrome Glock 9, I gotta put it on
That.38 special, I gotta put it on
Never leave the house without the teflon
Hop off the porch like, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus - will.I.am and Game:]
Ooh, that new bounce
New bounce, new bo don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me

[Verse 2 - Game:]
Nigga, don't trip
Don't trip, homie
Yeah, I'm the opposite of Crip, homie
You ain't even gotta ask, niggas know me
I make it rain like Tony, Toni, Tone!
Aventador to the corner store, I whip this hard
Compton God, watch em jump over cop cars
Yeah, I grew up to N.W.A., nigga
And my grannies whipping yay-yay, nigga

[Verse 3 - Ice Cube:]
Come on, don't trip, homie
Ice grew up around Crips, homie
Where you motherfuckers find this phony?
Acting hard, he's a tenderoni
The boulevard to the prison yard, I push this cart
Westside rolling, wherever you are
And I been coming up, and ain't none of ya'll niggas running up
Cause I'm quickdraw when I'm gunning up
Boy you know the sun ain't coming up
Layed that ass down
Tryna milk this cash cow
Face down, look at you now
Bitch!

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Dr. Dre:]
You know the deal greet a nigga on your knees bitch
You heard the talk around town I don't need shit, Compton
Deep water got em sea suck
Murder, murder shit and ain't nobody see shit
Bomb weed, palm tree, gold D shit
Who that nigga that said I wasn't gon be shit
Cocktail through the window with the indo
It's what this is we gon stress them innuendos
We do what we wanna when we want to
And we never hesitated to confront you
And we same shit as kids
It was normal to us, I might take you
But it might fuck around and haunt you
Shoulda come and see this shit
Give a fuck about no tours, nigga
I want you to come and be this shit
Ren, Cube, Yella, Dre and Eazy-E t**s shit
See how long it take your punk ass to leave this bitch
Compton

[Chorus - The Game:]
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip

[Verse 5 - The Game:]
Don't trip blood, I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my boogie jacket giving you the facts on

We was fighting over territory with the T Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker don't you pull it
Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

[Chorus - The Game:]
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip

[Verse 6 - The Game:]
Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say Game, why you always act a fool like that?
Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me why they have to do a ru like that
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They see like that, we be like that
We trip like that cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out

[Outro - Will.I.Am:]
When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know
I got it
When you see me
Congratulate a nigga don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas yep, true!
That's why I don't trip on these niggas
Would you?
Nigga is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep!
What happens when niggas unite and start making the moves
Don't trip


[Jelly Roll:]
Ego's, ego's
We broke up like The Beatles
Now a nigga out here on his own, WOO YEAH!
Grandmama baby gotta turn up
Granddaddy was a preacher, YEAH!
What the fuck that got to do with me, though?
Not a goddamn thing, not a motherfucking thing, NO!
Big nigga got a dream, motherfucking dream, I turn 'em to reality
Wake up in the morning by myself
So I'mma go hard 'til I got nothing left
âCause I'mma die by myself, just like you, motherfucker
âCause you ain't no better than me, no better than we ('tell 'em)
Motherfucker
Everytime I'm in the light, I'm in the dark, Ray Charles (Ray Charlie!)
Like OOH, OOH YEAH! GOOD LORD! HASHTAG!
What has changed besides the whole motherfucking world?
It won't be long before the whole world go into stress

[Game & (Jelly Roll):]
Smoke enough to get fucked up
(Get high nigga, hold on, we smoking for)
Til' the day I die nigga, West side nigga, smoking chocolate thai nigga
Can't hit my mothafuckin' blunt unless yo ass got five nigga
Bumpin' Luniz, watchin' Goonies get head on my mama's couch, she walked in
Had to cuss my mama out, she said get a job, get up off yo ass
(I'm like "Ooh Hashtag"!)
Now just relax my nigga, picture me rollin' down Compton Boulevard
With a chopper on my lap, now repost that my nigga
Don't make me DM your BM, she wanna see him cause he win whatever he in
Park a Bugatti at my mama house
They ain't even payin' rent, livin' sugar free
(Nigga why you bullshittin')
I'm just a hood nigga, all I wanna do is buy swishers
Take pictures while I'm fucking on these bitches
Hittin' switches while I'm dippin'
Red Cup full of betchu can't kill it
Three wheelin' and I bet I won't spill it
Not one drip
Been driving through Compton all day ain't got sweated by one Crip
It's my lucky day, and even if it wasn't, a nigga still wouldn't give a fuck today
Don't pull it if you ain't gonna blast
My nigga you can be a hashtag! (Yeah!)

[Jelly Roll:]
Everytime I'm in the light (I'm in the light)
I'm in the dark (In the dark)
Ray Charles (Ray Charles)
Like ooh, yeah, get lost
Hashtag!
What has changed besides the whole motherfucking world?
It won't be long before the whole world go into stress
I swear
Goddamn
Believe that
No brakes


Just the other day, I...[x6]

Just the other day, I saw a hologram of Eazy around my way
I started to pray, I hopped up in that Maybach
I know I said I wouldn't but sometimes a nigga gotta crossover like A.I
I crossover like Steph Curry, crossover like CP
But I will not crossover so niggas can buy the CD
This NWA ha, smokin' that Bombay, we stay high
Niggas is killin', we out the way ha
I think about the day I first met Dre
I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A
I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La
Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre
I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song "Hittin' Switches", then I recorded the shit with Faith
I did the BET Awards with Mary J
I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas

Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
Shout-out to the Bay, bruh
Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA
Where that Alize now?
Case a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side

Shout to my niggas up in Wayside
Take these Amber Rose pictures, send up 'em the way
I love my niggas, especially in the pen
I hold you down if I never see you again
I put that on my kids
I sweat them blood tears
I trade places with you, and do some of your years
I confronted my fears
I roll up a fat one and disappear on the pier
I wish you niggas was here and
Just the other day I, was riding through the old hood
Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good
I understand I've been misunderstood
Niggas hate me cause they wishin' they could
Kill me, put my face on obituaries when I was just in they hood
Keepin' they bitches in missionary positions now look
Don't ever ask me about Dre I, been 100 with my nigga since the day I, signed to the Math and

Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream that I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
Shout-out to the Bay, bruh
Cause my niggas drivin' down with Chronic to LA
Where that Alize now?
Case a nigga wanna trip, got the thing on my waist side

Just the other day I
Seen a Compton hat and I swear it reminded me of Eazy
Just the other day I
Had a dream I did some more G Shit with Nate Dogg
And you ain't gotta ask you know
Where I'm from
Nigga don't ask you know where I'm from


[Hook - will.I.am:]
I'm coolin' in LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in LA

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Pull up to the Rosco's
Only guy here, cause niggas from here

Eatin' chickens with these chickens, politicin'
We gon' get a new team or not
They up and down like Impala switches
All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody trippin', we mix Ciroc with Patron here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smokin' on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga
Welcome to the circle maine
Catch me off of rodeo, Alamita, Figueroa
Whoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row
And I ain't dissin' homeless people, I be down there feedin' niggas

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Impala

[Hook - will.I.am & Fergie:]

Baby when you comin' to LA
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg:]
I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with [?] on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
[?] the skinny jeans, gucci [?] straight saggin'
Pleasure of, and agony, black jeans Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a [?], charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat jay
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car

[Hook - will.I.am & Fergie:]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in LA

La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you comin' to LA
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 3 - will.I.am:]
I got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'
No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorian rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down to [?], East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, qe pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it, (inhale?)
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfucken' traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfucken' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga to madres
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car

[Hook - will.I.am & Fergie:]
In LA
The place where stars are born

Because the rain will never stop
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been coolin' in Compton
(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)

[Verse 4 - The Game:]
It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been fiendin' for this shit, aftermath [?], crackhouse
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the mack out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStation's
I hate waitin'
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'm a do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this lama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I see ya mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus? The SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember [?], I'll rest, I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight outta Compton, I'm the fucken movie poster to it, nigga


[Marcus Blvck:]
Started with a dollar and a dream
Sorta like Jordan getting cut from the team
Sorta like Dre 'fore he met Jimmy Iovine
I was lost out here, real niggas know what I mean
I said I started with a dollar and a dream
Sorta Jordan when he won his first ring
Sorta like Dre with the headphone thing
You could be whatever you want nigga, we all kings

I had a dream last night, I was rich Porter
Then I had a dream I had a bitch like Kim Porter
Then I had a dream I had bricks like transporter
Change my life like Steph Curry in the fourth quarter
What if you drove by a playground and witness 
Michael Jordan taking off for his first dunk, bet you wish you had your camcorder
That's the type of shit I'm made of
That's the type of shit I'm made of
Fourteen carat goldÙ Raekwon first album
Nothing but a G thang like when Dre met Calvin
That's the type of shit I'm made of
That's the type of shit I'm made of

Yeah, Yeah
Ay, wherever Nas is in the world he gon' fuck with this
Waddup, God
Queensbridge just like Compton, dog
In Inglewood niggas just like Yonkers, y'all
Where them Angels at?
(singing)
Sing it for me one more time
(more singing)
While I pretend to sniff this line

I used to wanna be Eazy
Then I realized it wasn't that easy
I used to wish that I was 2Pac
Then I realized that might get you shot
Figured I just gonna be myself though
Niggas hate me, Documentary on they shelf though
In this Impala, old school like some shell toes
Had a fake gold chain, but don't nobody else knows
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
Snitchin' on my homeboy, gossipin' bout old boys
Keep buyin' them Ferraris cause I grew up with no toys
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
I'm just trying to get my weight up
I'm just trying to get my weight up
Hol' on, I'm just tryin' to get my weight up
Big Homies drivin' by, tellin' me to stay up
How the fuck I'm 'posed to stay up?
When this weed got me feelin' like [?] bruh
I just seen Mac Dre bruh and the Jacka
Is we up in the Bay bruh?
Record my demo, something that I wish I could do again
I'm with that old shit, pulled up in my newer Benz
I went from JT the Bigga Figga to Biggie
We all make mistakes look what happened to me and 50
Record my demo, something that I wish I could do again
I'm with that old shit, pulled up in my newer Benz
I went from JT the Bigga Figga to Biggie
We all make mistakes look what happened to me and 50


[Intro - Kanye West & Sarah Barthel:]
Let me know if you're feeling lonely

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Cause ain't no real niggas out here
Ye what these niggas start humming out their mouth with?
Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this
Whole mothafucking album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearing red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wrecking shit since 05
No lie, Js on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these mothafuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'm a get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50 keep the change hoe

[Chorus - Kanye West & Sarah Barthel:]
Feeling lonely
Let me know if you're feeling crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept em waiting
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night
Feeling lonely
The night, it swallowed my soul
Let me know if you're feeling lonely

[Verse 2 - Game & Kanye West:]
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fucking shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I, aghhk
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestyling verses
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
[Felicia:] Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, nigga I know you see me!
[Game:] Felicia what the fuck you want?
[Felicia:] Ooh please can I borrow your car?
[Game:] Borrow my car? bitch are you stupid or something?
[Felicia:] Well give me a quarter piece then
[Game:] bitch I don't sell crack no more
[Felicia:] Well give me some money or something I can take around your brother house and trade
[Game:] I ain't got shit
[Felicia:] What about this iPod and them Dre Beats, you don't need that shit, don't you know that nigga or something?
[Game:] So?
[Felicia:] Please, I'll suck your dick for this shit
[Game:] bitch you can have this shit, I don't want my dick sucked by no mothafucking smoker
[Felicia:] Oh okay, thank you then. You know I would have sucked your dick for it anyways with your fine ass
[Game:] Felicia get the fuck away from my car
[Felicia:] Okay, what is you listening to on this shit anyway?
[Game:] bitch press play


Turn the beat up, yeah

New York, New York; wake up LA
Wave hi to the Chi, let's get right today
I heard them lil' niggas takin' their life away
I heard a couple lil' niggas got life today
Is it Farrakhan, Buddha, or Christ today?
She on her knees so she know what it's like to pray
She got religious so she doin' it twice a day
I strap up, no I ain't throwin' dice today
When you got money on yo head it's a price to pay
And it get cold in the hood, put your ice away
They locked Rick Ross up and they ain't give him no bail
But a cracker shoot a whole church up and it's "Oh well"
Oh well, oh well
Hang him with a confederate flag in his cell
Let him sit there and rot 'til his body turns to bones
Just remember who casted the first stone
New York, New York; good mornin' LA
Say hi to the Chi, celebrate to the Bay
No hesitation like Steph, shoot it right in your face
Cause I'm a Golden State warrior strapped with a K
How's it land of the free, when we're trapped in a cage?
Some shit just never make sense like Magic and AIDS
Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays
Obama must be in the city, it's traffic today
Niggas trappin' today just like back in the day
We like Roc-A-Fella Records, we packagin' yay
And that Dirty Sprite 2 shit slappin' today
We got these niggas boxed in like Cassius Clay
And my feregammo belt where that ratchet stay
Cause the police killing too many blacks today
I wake up in the morning like:"who gon' pass away? who gon' blast today? who gon' have to pray?"
New York, New York
Good morning L.A. My nigga Hayes blew him and his wife away

This song is dedicated to Stephanie Mosley, who was murdered from a single gunshot wound inflicted by her husband, Earl Hayes, in Los Angeles, California; December 18th, 2014. I knew Hayes since we were both signed to Aftermath back in 2005. And if I can keep it 8 more than 92 with you, he was a good nigga, I never saw that coming. My prayers are with Stephanie's entire family, I am truly and deeply sorry for your loss


[Verse 1 - Game:]
Back when Dot was hangin' at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Back when my drivers license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I'm well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seedâ¨And harvest All my king stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my deja vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick reppin' these cold streets
Know we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, "Drive by it, " I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga it's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!

[Interlude - Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

[Verse 3 - Game:]
There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they need a dollar
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up cause
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, "Just keep your hand on the brick"
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie


[Intro:]
I put that on Piru
Yo Game, let's go

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Ran the west for a decade nigga, check the bio
Gave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio
Autographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino
Straight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral
You lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible
Yeezus, that's my Nike town rival
Dare a nigga try me now, like why me now
Lookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down
Stay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah
All my shit bump like Craig Mack face
Ask your favorite bitch how my dick taste
Ask your neighbor's bitch how my dick taste
Don't take orders, I dictate
Get your shit straight, dickface
Perpetual Rollies with the big face
I got 'em lovin' the movement
Beard so long, I'm feelin' like Rick Rubin

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 2 - Game:]
Top floor at the Biltmore
Say they want a war, shit, that's what I'm built for
Loungin', Miami with the eye candy
Bitches names Sandy and Bambi, my exes can't stand me
God blessed the nigga with more swag than Jigga
More hoes than Trigga, Trigga no, that's my nigga though
Figure four down, Figueroa
Rick Flair Phantom
All red flannel, niggas don't hit me though
Spit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold
Ever since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope
Love Jimmy, fuck Interscope
I'm a don, walk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh
Shit on my lawn, snakes in the grass
I hear 'em slitherin' and hissin' whenever I pass
Ridin' 'round in somethin' French; Khloe Kardash'
Two-hundred on the dash, that's your ass

[Hook - Game:]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead
Walked through every hood in LA, bandana on my head
Guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out
Bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Outro - Diddy:]
Yo, this nigga Game bought me a motherfuckin' red Ferrari for my birthday, nigga. (I put that on Piru) Told me I was honorary. (Put that on Piru) I said, nigga, I'm with whatever with this motherfuckin' red Ferrari, nigga. Yeah, I'll take it. Nigga, Game givin' out red Ferraris for no reason, it was just a Tuesday. A motherfuckin' Tuesday. Niggas said happy Tuesday, Puff. Now that nigga wanna stand on my Ferrari every day. Now that nigga wanna stand on my motherfuckin' Ferrari all the time. Drivin' down the street with Hype Williams shootin' a video. We ain't even shootin' a video, we just motherfuckin' ridin' down the street, this nigga got Hype Williams shootin' and shit. See this what happens when that east meets west, we get together, know what I'm sayin'? Say fuck the rest, we start partyin' and bullshittin', havin' a good time, throwin' pool parties and shit. Niggas start buyin' niggas from the east coast Ferraris and shit, shit all good, red Ferraris at that, nigga. Shit, ain't got no time for no other shit, I just got time to get this motherfuckin' money man. Get this money with me man. So that's what we decided to do so now we gettin' more money than anybody and everybody. And the only color that we motherfuckin' at the end of the day gonna beef over is that motherfuckin' green motherfucker


[Verse 1 - Game:]
I'm from the home of the malt liquor, talk slicker
Where guns spark quicker, on four niggas
Them niggas better walk with you, take the long way home
My finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong
Like Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows
Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas
Never said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga
The Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this
Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, "Nigga come hear this shit"
He thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice
Los Angeles God, we mob like Infamous
Ain't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones
Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come
Lives, I done took some

[Hook - Sha Sha:]
When I look around I hear something tell me
That I'm the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon' kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real

[Verse 2 - Game:]
I kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy
I pull up floors and take them charges with me
Aventador as I explore the city
Phillipe's with my henchmen, nigga, word to Jimmy
You could be swimmin' in the Hudson, it's nothin'
Think I'm bluffin'? Guns cocked, say somethin'
Ain't too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather
Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you'd be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I'm out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that bazooki
And that's my I'm the dookie
You fuck me, I'm fucking your bitch, stupid

[Hook - Sha Sha:]
When I look around I hear something tell me
That I'm the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon' kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real

[Outro - DeJ Loaf & Game:]
Dej holla at these niggas for me
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
Pull up on a nigga like, "uh"
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
You know I know where you live at, boy
Pull up on a nigga like, uh"


[Hook - Game:]
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine

[Verse 1 - Game:]
I think I might bang the whole summer
Pull up in the block with the old Missy hummer
Hop out with my bandana tied around my head like Pac
Westside nigga, never had a problem banging BIG
Who would ever know I spit crack when I was slanging it
My Uncle Greg whipped it all the time
My Daddy used to whip it all the time
My brother started whipping his and mine
I sat back, played my position until I got the hang of it
On my way to school in that Michael Jordan jersey
Crips used to sweat me but I ain't nervous
And I wore it on purpose

[Hook - Game:]
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine

[Bridge - Jelly Roll:]
They don't know
About the summertime, a lot of niggas dyin'
They don't know
About the summertime, I'm just tryna survive

[Verse 2 - Game:]
All I ever wanted was a red Honda
Yeah, you can tuck the rag but the tats don't lie
Give me a trap queen, we gon' sell it
Give me a trap queen, we gon' sell it
Tell me, what you gon' do when the trap goes dry?
You can try Visine but the stats don't lie
And I hope you ain't alone when you sell it
Said I hope you ain't alone when you sell it
Took 5 shots and survived the pine box
Swear I'm happy I'm still here so I can tell it
I know you're jealous, I know you don't like me
But you whoopin' my ass or killin' me is unlikely
Welcome to Cedar Block and...

[Hook - Game:]
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
I think I might bang the whole summertime
Top down in the winter, nigga this summer's mine

[Bridge - Jelly Roll:]

[Intro:]
The Documentary 2 [x2]
Damn it I done did it again
Game still in Cali
Game still in Cali eatin' off the Documentary
The Documentary 2 [x2]
Damn it I done did it again

[Hook:]
So, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown
Yo, what it do blood? Talk of the town
Premo, Doc Dre still holding it down
Aftermath do the math nigga you know the sound
Doc 2 thought you knew still holding the crown

[Verse 1:]
Last ten been all ten
Make it look easy, my pen been on Ren
My niggas been on kush, my bitches been on X
King of California give a fuck who got next
I'm right now
Bump your gums and the ratchet'll shoot ya
Send your ass back to the future
No Delorean
Aventador and shit, bumpin' Future
Why your girl pullin' on my hookah
Money stretch like Karma Sutra
Started with the roosters
Then I start spittin' clean the money like a loofah
6'5, tall like a hooper, ball like a hooper on the floor like a hooper
So I must be Clay with the.38, Thompson with the Thompson
Everything about me Compton, I mean everything about me Bompton
I ain't never had shit, grew up like Magic Johnson

[Verse 2:]
I taught myself how to spit from listening to It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold D's is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris, Rihanna, Karrueche
Homie I ain't gotta gas I'm so ahead of you fags
The shit I spit off Premo tracks burn confederate flags
Take the roof off roof, gimme Proof back and 2Pac
Westside, but you already knew that

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I've been rapping for 12 years, 6 months, 16 days
Now I'm a veteran, spit a 16 sixteen ways
Sixteen in a clip, spit it 16 ways
I know six teens, pull up to a sweet sixteen and spray
I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and (Bandage?)
Bruise and damage, fuck you rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the (Wu?) and phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer
Maybe the old Em, I'm slim and I'm shady
Maybe the old Hammer, Rakim, you niggas keep bullshittin' like Joe (Kemp?)
You so him, I'm so not, you so bitch, I sold rock
My four-four cocked, I been a Top Dawg, I know Doc
Back in '06 I pulled up in that gold drop
Five million sold livin' in the dope spot

[Hook]

[Scratches:]
The Documentary 2 [x2]
Damn it I done did it again

[Outro:]
[DJ Clue:]
Check it out man, I go by the world famous DJ Clue, desert storm, shoutout to my nigga Game. When I first came to the west coast, and me and Game hit the studio up, and he rapped for me, I knew he had all the key ingredients to become a legendary rapper
[DJ Envy:]
Here's DJ Envy from that Breakfast Club, I remember the first time hearing The Game, I just knew he was gonna be one of them niggas, one of them legendary niggas. That boy Game, he's a problem, I got my money on it
[Funkmaster Flex:]
Funk Flex baby! I dropped the bomb on every one of them joints off the Documentary!


[Car Engine Noise, One Way's Cutie Pie plays in the background]
Adrianna!!
Adrianna
[Adrianna:] Que paso, Papi?
[Game:] Nada
[Adrianna:] Cuando me vas a llevar a TJ para puedas conocer mis padres?

[T:] Yeah, well dig. I heard you been over there in that studio with Dr.Dre landing down them cold YA DIG'S!
[Game:] Yeah man, we been over there gettin' it in
[T:] Well, you know. Just let 'em know one thing


[Intro - 50 Cent]
Baby this is real shit
my record sell slow I'm show you my dick [7x]

[The Game]
Hit a breakdown
No 400 bars yet, I don't need that
I'm gas, your whole click is ass, I mean that
G-Unot cocksucker, better believe that
I say it one time, watch the whole world scream back
G-U-N-O-T, now thats for Billboard, rest in peace
And since my nigga died, I been stress no sleep
Contemplating suicide in my Lexus jeep
I tried twice but I couldn't make my death complete
I guess you could say Mya got the best of me
Came back from the dead to address the beef
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat
You could get it in the stomach just like Raheem
Cause running with a snitch is not quite my thing
I tried to take Buck with me, but he stayed on the scene
Guess all I can do now is pray for Supreme
While I finish my next album, 5 million and countin
Anticipating, tellin the world I did it without him
If Aftermath was a family that didn't have a mother
I'd be Dre's newborn, you'd be the jealous older brother
Yea, daddy love us but in the meanwhile
You talkin behind his back and in his face you smile
You moved out the house, You a failure now
And lil' Game grew up to be a problem child
I whip yo head boy, that's for Kanye West
I whip yo head boy, with the back of my tech
Yeap, your fuckin group fell flat without me
You mad, what you gonna do rap about me?
Your bars is park garbage, hooks is mediocre
And your new shoes look like Reebok pennyloafers
Try to walk in my shoes a block
Hurricanes in stores the day after Christmas, nigga fuck Reeboks
You a steroid addict, you need Detox
Hopefully you make it out in time to be on Detox
Cause BlackWallstreet expandin, yea I bought 3 blocks
My (CL) so (Smooth), it should of came with Pete Rock
And lets not forget who made me hot
It was Dr. Dre that took me out the weed spot.
You want credit, forget it, I did it on my own
Gave you 300 bars, then said I'm gone
But I'm back, this is rap and a fact is a fact
They say once you turn snitch, you never go back
Heres a picture of Ja Rule, motherfucker hold that
What goes around comes around, get used to the gold plaques
Homie got cheese, but he don't feed no rats
I show the world my dick if Lloyd Banks go plat
I'm lyrically insane, Lloyd Banks know that
He told me I was like a Big Daddy Kane throwback
Started with 1 brick, built my own company
And don't spread news about it unless it come from me
Guess whos the boss, nigga my squad deep
But Glasses Malone is not signed to BlackWallstreet
Nigga don't, don't, don't, don't, don't believe the hype
Hear that Mike?
And don't be alarmed, this is not a diss
But missusing my logo kinda got me pissed
And I got enough beef, now Lil' Eazy dissin
He don't write his own raps, so I gotta forgive him
I got love for ya pops and I always will
So on behalf of Eric Wright, my nigga you gotta chill
I'm the reason you new westcoast nigga's got a deal
While I was doin mixtapes, they was watching College Hill
For real, you motherfuck's ain't got half my skill
I run this shit like OJ and pass for the bills
Trying so hard to be a gangsta, nigga you seethrough
Posing like 50 on the cover of the GQ
Button up shirt with the cut off sleeves
I got twin desert eagles, nigga suck on these
I got that CEO flow, yeah my bars are sweet
Like Hova in Takeover, chewin out Mobb Deep
Like Pac on Hit Em Up, chewin out Mobb Deep
Don't one of you niggas got sickas cell, fuck your talk is cheap
When I see you, and I'm gonna see you
I'm strip you down asshole naked and thats how I'm leave you
Then I'm find Havoc, make him walk through Queens nude
With Black Wallstreet tattooed on his back
Nigga's signed to G-unit, now they bustin guns
But last week it was: "My nigga Game, what up dun?"
See thats what the fuck I mean, you can't trust these rap niggas
And you wonder why I always say fuck these rap niggas
So I'm break it down for MC's and friends
If you don't hear your name, let the beef begin
Ain't got shit against Hov, I like the nigga style
Nas is my nigga, I been bangin him for a while
I fuck with Fat Joe, he got the streets locked
And thats the same reason I fuck with Kiss and D-Block
Place Eminem in the number 3 spot
And Snoop is like my big brother, we both raised by the Doc.
Young Jeezy you hot, we both new to this
While I'm in the ATL, shout out to Ludacris
Cause your uncle Scarface show me that crime pays
Just like Paul Wall got me "sittin sideways"
And I can't forget about the homie Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones, Skeet screw the fuckin song
I fuck with Slim Thug and my nigga Bun B
Can't do that without saying free pimp c
And thats the reason why 50 try to pimp me
So I went window shoppin and bought 2 Bentleys
I'm in the drivers seat, motherfucker don't tempt me
Turnin Spider Loc against me, cause your scared to come get me
Cuz know whats up, Bloods still got love for em'
Come to the block, I'll shake off the rub for em'
Ask for G-Unit, motherfucker its a rap
Ma$e made it out alive, thank God for that
If Dipset don't get you, Jesse Jackson will
And if all else fails, I'll see you in hell
Wear that G-Unit spinner when you come to L.A.
I have a nigga parkin cars, dressed up like valet
He gonna turn back pastor when the gun in his face
The real chain still in Chicago when I'm takin the fake
You can call who you want, I ain't givin back shit
Unless Olivia show the whole world she got a dick
Can't seem to save her life, but she talk a lot of shit
And I want my 10 G's cause Yayo caught a brick
I guess my G-Unot tattoo was a smart move
Cause in the end you lost a 100 Mil. to a cartoon
3 years after you got tatted by cartoon
The beef is over, G-Unit is gonna fall apart soon

[Outro]
Hahahahaha
Faggot ass niggas
I guess I win nigga
Life is a game of chess nigga...
Some King, Some Queens
Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Pastor fuckin Ma$e
You niggas is pawns
50, or Boo Boo, or Curtis, or Chicken Little, Hahaha
Stop Snitchin, Stop Lying!, In Stores December 6th
The DVD, Its a tell all motherfuckers
Yea, my documentaries be better than your movies nigga, Hahaha
I drove by your house nigga
Go buy the DVD, $16,99 nigga
At your local record store, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, Warehouse
Shout out to the moms and pops, for helping me slay dem faggots.
G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-gu-g-g-gu, G-UNOT! Hahahaha
Pop off nigga, Hahahaha, Pop off
It's me, The G-A-M-E, gone

[Verse 1 - Notorious B.I.G.]
1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tangere or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the lights of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Sty
Checkin' his daughter, Teana into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B.I. was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed ducth masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wraped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum

[Verse 3 - Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck the football team
Risk it, rupt' your spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream, made my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Ma' said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
Seat 74, Mart 8 set me straight
Not able to move, behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail

High in the air, got the wrist freeze up
Same nigga that don't bang
But you could back ya ass up nigga, cause the 5th gon flame
While you at it, move ya eyes off my wall street chain
They say we movin like an organized street gang
All hues of blue, all shades of flame
New west coast we doin the damn thang
This year we make power moves
With O.G.'s that been home, niggaz still bathe in their shower shoes
Grown full, I never move how a coward move
Never heard of defeat bitch, I don't know how to lose
Thought it would end, but it seems we ain't done
Boy wagin war on the coast he ain't from
Tryin to pit niggaz against us, cancel Christmas
It'll be a lot of sense ??

[Chorus - The Game]

[Verse 3 - The Game]
See Game in the streets, see Game with his chain hangin
Hood tatted on his neck, nigga I'm gangbangin

Mob got Tammy-Ru, Face run Cedar Block
Don't fuck with me homies, I know Jova from T-Flats
Downa from the 18th Streets let the heat clap
Tre-D from Insane, Bg Woody from Nutty Block
Main Streets got Dell-Dogg, Wood, and Stutter Box

Might run into Wacko from West Side Piru
K-Dog, and T-Money, Mansfield Thugs
2-Ts and Du-Dog from Bounty Hunter Bloods
Magic from Avalon, Twin from Santana

Rick James from Fruit Town, Bam in the Denver Lanes

[Chorus]
I told you not to fuck with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
I'm riding through your neighborhood with my stainless
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up
You know nigga look at my face

I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
You told us that Ja Rule was a wanksta
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
Now the whole G-Unit camp is in danger
It's The Game, nigga look at my face

[Verse 1]
First things first motherfuckin, stop tellin them lies
It's easy to stretch the truth now that homo died
In front of your grandma's house, right outside
Nigga ran up on yo' shit and let off nine
And Fifty knows homocide let off nine
You ain't die cuz you only got shot 3 times
1 in the jaw, two in's and out's
He was screaming that' shy they knocked his teeth out
I've seen your medical reports you phony homie
Look me in the eye's I tried to warn you homie
A coward dies a thousand deaths in his vest
I'll give you six more slug, you can add to the rest
Till' everybody from NY wanna be from the west
Kiss my converse bitch and take your last breath
Cuz that G-Unit shit ain't gonna last
You could sign Jesus Christ, he couldn't save your ass

[Chorus 2x]
I told you not to fuck with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
I'm riding through your neighborhood with my stainless
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up
You know nigga look at my face

I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
You told us that Ja Rule was a wanksta
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
Now the whole G-Unit camp is in danger
It's The Game, nigga look at my face

[Verse 2]
I took a trip to Connecticut, I was lurking with the Glock
Mad cuz Shot Money had me working with the cops
You 5-0 nigga, that your name
Where I come from 5-0, that's some change
When your first album came out you left out some things
You get low like Bleek when them ratchets bang
Mase step inside the confessional booth
You turned your back on God, the devil got you spooked
You ain't Murder shit, you don't even got your own block
Takin orders from a snitch, who sleep with cops
and Little Curtis always lookin for a scam to pull
you ain't the real 50 Cent,you signed some bull
You got shot in the mouth once you still talkin' shit
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick has got to fit
Now my nuts on your tonsils, my little kid is screaming G-UNOT at your council

[Chorus]
I told you not to fuck with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
I'm riding through your neighborhood with my stainless
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
If I can't get you I'm fucking Lloyd Banks up
You know nigga look at my face

I told you not to mess with my gangsta
I swear to God I told him Mase
Prayin on my downfall since I came up
Young Buck, Olivia ain't safe
You told us that Ja Rule was a wanksta
Yayo, I'm Outside your place
Now the whole G-Unit camp is in danger
It's The Game, nigga look at my face

[Chorus - The Game]
Cherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)

Three-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

[Techniec]
I see 'em tryin shine like Tech
Cause I shine like I be grinding on the set, got the diamonds on my neck
Most talked about when I hit that strip, watch it bounce when I hit that dip
Come to close might get that clip, click BANG
Don't trip, Tech don't slip, laces up the roll go get my bitch
Get my grip, talk my shit, hit my switch and dip
Switchin lanes on them Dana Danes, same color as that candy paint
Tangerine with (I can't tell the rest cause of E-40)

[E-40]
I tried to never sober, chalupa, longer then a roller coster
Out hear a head a hub a head and do ya for quarter ounce of yollup
Venomos snakes, like some cobras, up top is where I'm from
We be lettin our nuts hang over our shoulders, figure 8 and go and duck
Droppin with all 4 doors open, gassin and brakin and yolkin
We hyphy, we stupid valeho, Richmond, Frisco, Oakland
We 9ers, we raiders, we some hustlers and some players
We've got 64s and low lows, but most of us rider scrapas

[Crooked I]
Lord forgive me it in me to sent me to tote semi's
Grope penny and remy my pockets was so skinny
Now I blow pennies on 4 hemi's
Run the whole city/hoes, I put dough before any
My 6th sense helped me view better cheddar kid
I fucks mo hoes then Hugh Heffner ever did
That new leather shit the coup hell sick
Dude move ahead of who ever cause dude never quit

[Chorus - The Game]
Cherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)

Three-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

[Chingy]
Cranberry impala, that's my lowrider
Slide by your north sider rider with a hoe driver
G'd up from the feet up plus the heat tough
Toe game crack the grey goose and spark the weed up
When I'm in LA I go in Crenshaw and floss a little
Slot a lot thang in that Black Wall Street
Double U and P and CPT we keeping it G
In our low riders riders riders

[Lil' Rob]
We put them cracks up on the wall, cucarachas crawl
I keep my head up and it wont fall, no not at all
I'll break ya jaw like a break the law, leave you all in all
The lowrider so low, you won't know what you saw
I sit low with a tall can, in a brown bag
With a brown rag, bouncing a brown rag
With the Mexican flag and the American flag
Hitting the fronts and the backs, watching out for the bash

[Paul Wall]
Home boy, Big T, better know as Tyrone
Is the first person I ever seen with a chevy on chrome
My parter bought it got the slab, wine berry over gold
With screen in the head rest just to let you know we holding
I fell in love with it, and I dropped him some cash
Now that's me you see flippin slab, riding on glass
How much it cost, don't ask, baby just know this
I could bought a Benz instead with the money I spent

[Chorus - The Game]
Cherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)
Three-wheelin the 64 (my lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

[The Game]
My 64 sittin on that chrome, chrome glock sitting on my lap
2 hoes ridin in the back, candy paint, nigga fuck with that
3-wheel motion, I'm sitting high, daytonas, that's all we ride
Hit that switch its do or die, ride on me that's suicide
I be in the hood smoking that green, Dr.Dre know what I mean
Swisha sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed
black diamonds off in my chain/ ask around nigga know my name
Compton own, the rap Lebron James, ridin low, I'm switchin lanes

[W.C.]
Make that brain splat 30 thang thang clap
Know for the game rap with the chrome frame wrap
From Harley Davidsons to low lows, we do tip 'em
13 hundred spokes with that blue nibble get the picture
Disrespect and I'm draw slugs
But ain't no set trippin cause nigga its all love
Dub C drop the real on 'em, chevy chrome grill on 'em
Posing in the intersection, 3-wheelin on 'em nigga

[Ice Cube]
Rasberry 64 bring your cherry
and we could make a Sunday, come home Monday
I'm sittin on the one-way, up on the Boulevard
Act hard, put ya thoughts on the dashboard
Cause if I come through the hood with the little homie
Nobody better fuck with the little homie
I hope Compton unite, South Central unit
I hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light

[Chorus - The Game]
Cherry 64 (My lowrider) hop in the low low (My my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black impala (My my lowrider, My my lowrider)

[Intro]
Not! [echoing]
Blackwall Street
The Game
Beach Boy
Charli Baltimore (he wears a red bandana)
Rockstar
We are the Black Gang
Free Shye
motherfuckers! (he wears a red bandana)

[Chorus]
On the front of murder talk (he wears a)
On the cover of the source you see (he wears a red bandana)
The whole world know (he wears a)
Every nigga in the hood know (he wears a red bandana)
50 told the NYPD (he wears a)
Why you snitch on me and tell 'em that (he wears a red bandana)
All the Pirus know (he wears a)
Even my crip niggaz know (he wears a red bandana)

[Verse 1]
Chea chea
Dear God let me clense my soul, throw away all the rims and the gold
O no I can't do that, do I love God? True dat, but I got a gun so move back
I'm loco like 5 eases in the side of Chevelle ridin on low pros
I'm a renegade ride with the 44, been a gangbanger all my life, fuck the popo
I ain't never been a cocky kid, know they could kill me if they shot Pac and Big
But I let my bandana hang, in the city of angles we gangbang
I move that chronic and yayo, way before I met 50, Banks, Buck and Yayo
Ask Eminem, even Dr.Dre knows, I put one in last ten in the range rov
Used to push that rock like Jay Hov, you better lay low when the ak blow
Or get wings and a halo, run to the hood and tell 'em I'm the nigga they gotta pray for
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said run to the hood and tell 'em
I'm the nigga they gotta pray for, lay low and stay low

[Chorus]
On the front of murder talk (he wears a)
On the cover of the source you see (he wears a red bandana)
The whole world know (he wears a)
Every nigga in the hood know (he wears a red bandana)
50 told the NYPD (he wears a)
Why you snitch on me and tell 'em that (he wears a red bandana)
All the Pirus know (he wears a)
Even my crip niggaz know (he wears a red bandana)

[Verse 2]
Chea chea
I'm a gangbanger don't get it fucked up
You ain't never bang, you ain't never laces chucks up
So how the fuck you gonna criticize me
I ain't the reason niggaz is bangin the NYC
Makin bullshit threats on the M.I.C.
I don't wake up in cold sweats when I sleep
I live comfortably, with a red rag tied
around the 45 in case nigga try to come for me
Mad cause I started my own company
I don't know what the fuck niggaz want from me
Except something for free
Before The Documentary dropped, you bitch niggaz wasn't bumpin me
And to some degree, I gotta keep that 4-5th under me, I don't run from beef
It's either cock back, squeeze
Or be underneath cause I'm from the streets of (Compton)
And my grandmother died before I was multi
wasn't raised right cause my parents was both high
High off cocaine, my introduction to the dope game came in 85 watchin soul train
Mama told me I was the future, and one day I'd be high like Soul Plane
Just don't bang/ but back then
I'd do anything for a jheri-curl and a gold chain
Niggaz always got something to say
Like they ain't never bumped N.W.A.
Punk niggaz talk shit, but when they need hits they come runnin to Dre
Niggaz come to LA when they need to talk
Cause Kanye told everybody Jesus Walks
Bush killed more niggaz in the towers then gangbanging ever did
That's why they need New York

[Chorus]
On the front of murder talk (he wears a)
On the cover of the source you see (he wears a red bandana)
The whole world know (he wears a)
Every nigga in the hood know (he wears a red bandana)
50 told the NYPD (he wears a)
Why you snitch on me and tell 'em that (he wears a red bandana)
All the Pirus know (he wears a)
Even my crip niggaz know (he wears a red bandana)

[Outro]
Yeah motherfuckers
Chuck Taylor
oh you thought I forgot about that alias huh?
I'm going back to my roots
G-Unit is dead

your clothes can't sell
your shoes are straight garbage
your movies suck!
Chicken Little killed you nigga
hahahaha [echos]

I took your style
I ain't doin no third verse
I'm just talk to you nigga

Curtis Jackson

Marcus... Snitch
Blackwall Street C.E.O. motherfucker!
Hurricanes in stores December 26th
Stop Snitchin Stop Lyin the DVDs in stores December 6th
it's a tell all nigga
wait till my movie come out
I'm glad it ain't based on my life
with that knock off 8 Mile shit
you could never be Eminem motherfucker
you ain't lyrically inclined enough to be Jay-Z, Nas, B.I.G. or Pac
and in the modern day... today, tomorrow, next week
you can't fuck with The Game nigga!
Out


[Chorus - Chicken Little]
I am the champion my friend
And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end
I am the champion
I am the champion
Don't end for loser cause I am the champion

[The Game]
Guess whos back in a son of a bitch
Underground king with a gun on his hip
Not the UGK like Bun B and Pimp C
But I got the Ghost Unit bumpin in my Bentley
Ain't shit changed with the guts in a range
And no more Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo and Young Buck in my lane
I'm a hood nigga for real motherfuck the fame
Nigga I'ma get mine
You can hate it or love it but it's a thin line
Between G-Unot and G-Unit
Nigga talk shit catch one in the hip
Fuck beef for the rhyme
50 forgot about his but I took mine
I showed you all 5 but he never took 9
He rap like Trina blah blah blah
Ok, shut up
Let us see the wound
Show it to the world
He got shot in the mouth and cried like a girl
You sing like a girl
And I gangbang so hard it'll bring back curls
I'm tellin' your fan don't believe that shit
Tryin beef with The Game like he that sick
You movie was trash and I went to see that shit
With a camera and got it on DVD that quick
Chicken Little and Harry Potter
The bootleg hell yeah we got 'em
Two movies 15 dollars with no numbers on the bottom
Hahahahahahaha.........
Chicken Little ghetto pimp!

[Chorus - Chicken Little]
I am the champion my friend
And I'll keep on fighting 'till the end
I am the champion
I am the champion
Don't end for loser cause I am the champion


[Verse 1: Game]
I was sentenced to a 5 album deal in '02
Spent the next couple years trying to figure out who was who
Met this New York nigga they called him Boo Boo
So we chopped it on the yard and he put me down with his crew
We was the hardest niggas in the penitentiary
Got a little bigger since Jimmy Iovine sentenced me
Sat back in my cell and wrote The Documentary
I ain't make no friends in jail, just enemies
A lot of bad memories, fucked up tendencies
Even bumped heads with this Young Buck from Tennessee
Say he got connects in Nashville got them 10 a key
Shit, we finna see, nigga knew I been a G
Never needed The Unit, that's how them niggas remembered me
Yo c.o. coming I'm a holla in a minute B
Niggas on the yard tripping, I ain't got the energy
Had a couple jail fights them niggas couldn't finish me

[Hook: Game]
25 to life
No fucking corona
Just animals in this bitch and I ain't trusting a soul
So while I'm up in here I might as well make the best of it
And pray to the lord he take care of the rest of it
25 to life
Got me feeling like I'm stuck
Only reason I survived because I don't give a fuck
Nothing but bad luck
And I ain't never cried a tear
Never going home, nigga fuck around and die here

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm getting sick and tired of these newcomers
I've been locked up for more than a few summers
Still gotta do numbers, still gotta do numbers
Looking at pictures of Keri Hilson on the wall, dick hard as a cucumber
Relax my mind, hit the yard and shoot a few jumpers
Really wanna shoot something, who the fuck wanna do something
This [?] named [?]
Told me I was the hardest nigga to ever hit the yard since Pac was on Death Row
I'm about to go fuck with my niggas on D block
Cause he know what to do when these niggas be taking cheap shots
Ask a nigga how long he got, he said about 9
Then we start having conversations about Shyne
Homie just got out, shit it's about time
We click cause he about his and nigga I'm about mine
So not near a nigga here can talk about Shyne and Lil Wayne neither
Get your pussy ass outlined

[Hook: Game]

[Verse 3: Game]
Niggas ain't stopping me
Especially with me and my nigga [?] state property
I could feel it in the air
Niggas up in here is scared
Niggas up in here is queers
Niggas up in here is dead
I think you a c.o
I think you a fed
Snitches get stitches that's the type of shit we do in here
Who the fuck is you in here
You fucking with a killer
Better have a lion heart fucking with a dealer
Reputations get ruined here play the game to win
Guns, I pack 10, the UCLA Bruin here
None of you fresh fish niggas couldn't do a year
Let alone a life sentence
I know R&B niggas harder than ya'll
Nigga Lyfe Jennings
Lloyd tried to rob my bank and got his fucking life ended
Now that I think about it dog, I'm starting to like prison
Next niggas get out of line I stick my knife in them

[Hook: Game]


[Hook]
Can you believe it?

Catch me in Wade County, Iâm the king like James
Headed to the Game, Red Challenger today
Throwinâ up red flags like Iâm challenging the play
Tune, this shit retarded, I need a red helmet
And Iâm all about my cake: red velvet
You canât help it, gotta see what I got
Itâs like Ripleyâs: Believe it or Not, you tell me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Iâm a Beast, believe that
Stop playing, I go hard, I go He-Man
Young Tune, break em off like a tree branch
Play with me, you in hot water: tea bag
All-black Maybach, call it decaff
And I just ordered your girlfriend some kneepads
Can you believe the unbelievable?
Bitch, Iâm higher than Venus, Serena too
Yeah, Game, holla at ya: Soo Woo
Young Money bitch, we cold like two scoops
Lifeâs a bitch and mine a diva
Point the biggest skeptic out I make âem a believer

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Baby]
Yeah, belee dat, a hundred on a marble floor
And everyday we on the grind tryna flip some more
Ya understand, acres on that new land
Suicide doors nigga, on that new Lambâ
P-p-pussy poppinâ bullshit
Bullshit ain't shit nigga we the shit

Belee dat, we ride every day homie

[Hook]


[Verse 1: AR]
A-R nigga, what
Fuck your baby momma, fuck all of her friends then I nut
I'm a nut, follow me on Twitter
Nigga don't be that bitter
If that's your girl, then I fuck
Nigga I smash it, pass it
From the Goods down to the Kardashians
Got stamps on my passport, stripes on my record
But that don't mean I can't get her naked, check it
Forty thou for my necklace, wrist so reckless
Tell your girl I got a hard dick for them wet lips
Tell her to sex this, tell her to text this
Tell her to pick me up, in her ex shit
Gone

[Verse 2: Game]
Not for long, graduated from Stanford, so I hear "Game Strong"
She look good dressed, you should see her in a thong
Get her so wet, she could bubble up a bong
Ass so right, make a nigga wanna tap that
Pussy so tight, fit my head like a snap back
Almost fell in love, but a nigga had to snap back
Pimp hand strong, tell her Goldie from the Mack back

[Verse 3: Nu Jerzey Devil]
Mr. Red Bottoms, nah, you ain't like me
Catch me with a fly white bitch, Ice-T
Who at your girl crib chillin'? Shit I might be
You ain't heard Jerz P I M P
See actin' cocky, so I threw on the mag
Put her ass down like a 6-4 rag
She wanna cuddle and keep, but get around
So I told her I only got one night in this town

[Hook: Game (& Kanary Diamonds)]
Stars are lit on nights
Time to put the bottles in the ice
Give me one night, I can change your life, right
Girl tell me what you want

(Everything comes with a price
I just want a little time, let me be your wife
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
Give it to me how I want it, you know how I want it)

[Verse 4:]
Started off with dust, now I got duckets
My bitch see a Benz, but I treat it like a buck
Drop that ass off, better keep the meter running
Got 3000 hits, Derek Jeter motherfuckers
Now rockin' with the greatest
All my number 4 Jordans, go buy the ace of spade shit
And these blood diamonds, cause a blood rhyming
Cold as 4th quarter nigga, I'm a call them Blood Bryant

[Verse 5:]
The newest everything, welcome to flight school
She hates Home Depot, I bet she like tools
You know I ride smooth, that Maserati sick
I need a parachute, baby I'm high as shit
Got all this fuckin' ice, I need a hockey stick
Nobody fuckin' with me, no, I ain't sellin' [?]
We getting hella bent, hell let the liquor talk
3 card monte tell that bitch we ice cards

[Verse 6: TD]
Now a nigga on, all these hoes wanna bother me
TD please, can you get us up in Colony?
All they wanna do is pop spades with the crew
Cause we pour the mob deep, without Havoc or Prodigy
Next day she like "You owe me an apology"
I'm like "What for? "
She like "Why you unfollow me? "
Since we bringing up old shit
Last time you gave me head, bitch why you ain't swallowing?

[Hook]

[Verse 7:]
The poor paper hustler, motherfucker give it to me, I can sell that
The homie sits around a whole lot of fly bitches, thinkin' I got held back
I left the crib and told momma I had a vision
And called your bitch up and told her I'm back pimpin'
My nigga Chuck hit me, I told him I had a verse
He told me it's only 8, I told him I make it work

[Verse 8:]
I be on my MacBook, internet pimpin'
Skyping with 2 naked bitches, trying to get a visit
I chat to her iPad, so [?]
I keep the snake on my head, these dudes are swallowin' my future

[Verse 9;]
One night, my neck bright and my wrists glisten
Fresh to death, get dressed at the mortician
Tore life, my wife, your entertainment
Baby I can make you famous

[Verse 10:]
Yeah, you know I'm laughin' at you niggas
Trippin' on them hoes, spendin' cash on them bitches
Tippin' on them hoes, I'm an ass on them sixes
Models on the phone, gettin' head, I'm chillin'
Big bottle poppin', the money in the building
Take this bitch over, shit that's how a nigga feeling
Fistful of Rozay, yeah a nigga get it
Now I'm trying to find a wife with all these motherfucking women

[Hook]


[Dr Dre:]
I'm in this muthafucker doing what I wanna
10 bottles, 10 bitches go with my persona
Pull up in that Enzo then I do donuts
I'm that cool, cashews, make 'em all go nuts

[Game:]
Baby got ass I need me a shot of that
Lil mama get gangsta for me
Stuff it in your Prada bag

[Dr Dre:]
That's right
She got something that I wanna see
That's right, so if she leave
She fucking with me, that's life
Twerk somethin', work something', hurt somethin'
She wanna check, check this shit out like a verse coming
They rip they neck and run they mouth when they heard something
Dre dropped another one and fucked around and murdered somethin'
Club filled with dead bodies, if not than you a zombie
I'm not gon' feel sorry, you pass out from it
Get drunk, get blunted
Do what you wanna do, drug test on you

[Game:]
Lotta money when I talk
Big mills, big deals
'Bout a hundred in a vault
Sit still, that real
Lotta haters throw salt, they lost
Big Game give a fuck how you feel
I fear she just might just pop that pill
And feel on me all night till the tip spill
Tip scales with her waistline, sex with the bassline
She gon fuck a snare drum one drink at a time

[Dr Dre:]
Blow right, hoes fight over my name
I got my dough right, hustle running all in my veins
It's forty days, forty nights if I'm making it rain
I reign supreme, a bottle and some bomb-ass weed
Than we gooood!

[Chorus:]
If you got drugs in this muthafucker, ohh
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something, high of something, high of something
Till your muthafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something
Ayy, what I supply taking you high?

[Game:]
Fireworks when I spark
Yellow tape, lotta chalk
Thought you said you a boss, big deal
Bitch chill, pulling out that black card
Showin' off big spendin', letting alcohol spill
I feel she might just get too faded, x-rated that's what I like
Glad that you made to this ceremoney at hand
Take a sip let's plan for the future
Introduce you to Snoop get you right and...

[Snoop Dogg:]
May I, kick a little something for G's
And, make a few ends, as I breeze through
The shit on my hip is a fucking preview
And guess what it lead to

[Chorus:]
If you got drugs in this muthafucker, ohh
Let me see your hands in the air
Narcotics in the club and the ladies love us
So let's get high off something, high of something, high of something
Till your muthafucking brain don't function
High of something, high of something
Ayy, what I supply taking you high?


[Hook: Game]
These niggas got me fucked up [x4]
These niggas got me, I think

I be on the block with that chrome boy, Postin' up with my home boy
Leanin' on the 2 tone boy, What you want for them zones boy

Take a shot of that 'tron boy, bag it up and then gone boy
They givin' [?] out, watch yourself on that phone boy
They gave me seven [?], mama singing that song boy
We gettin' money baby, we gettin' cash money
Stuntin' like im Birdman, sittin' on my cash

Paper stacking too long boy, blowing cheech and that chong boy
Better watch that tone boy, headshots to that dome boy

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Menace:]
Think a nigga trip the way I walk around
Gotta keep that pistol on my hip to lay them haters down
Gotta keep them bitches on my dick then I bring [?] around
Paper stash gon' break em down, fuck 'em hard don't make a sound
I'm all about that trap boy, ride around with that pistol
Gotta keep the bitch in my lap boy, hater niggas, come get ya
Made my niggas [?], my niggas clean, we do it [?], try to intervene
Thats suicide fuckin' with my team, I'm blowing clouds and I'm 'bout the cream
Yeah, and I'm bout that shit, we full of chips, and I'm [?] hoes

Really kill the niggas for it, niggas lookin' real important

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Game:]
Say boy, ever had a bitch all up in your crib
Stickin' that dick all up in the ribs
Then she tell fuck niggas where you live
And now they all up in your shit
Flippin' matresses over, turnin' couches sideways
They thinkin' crime pays
Got a choppa
For the niggas that don't understand how the fuck we ope-
-rate and anyway get back on top of my paper chase
Kush burnin', smell the dragon, 29's, been had 'em
Niggas take shots, then runnin' high
We'll find their ass, Bin Ladin
Me and Mike in the Benz wagon, better watch your block boy
Purple clouds of that Pepe Lepue, I'm gone of that Ciroc boy
Clipped up to that pop boy, holdin' on to that knot boy
Palms grippin' that Glock boy, we comin' back for them yachts boy

[Hook x2]


Welcome to the graveyard
Where everybody like to
Pray: allahu akbar
You scared to say "god? "
They call me game
Because I play hard
So get your helmets and
Your face guards
I spit holy water, let's have
A face off: nicholas cage
They say the boy is off the
Chain like two pits in a
Cage
Your girl say my flow the
Bomb like I swallow
Grenades
Respect the rules up in this
Shit so you gotta get paid
Or you gotta get spayed
Like windex with them
Twin techs
I'll raid on top of insects.
Niggas die fuckin they
Family
Oh, where I'm from they
Call that "incest"
Open the bible, good book
Serves it's purpose for
Shook crooks
Heavenly father, I think we
In heaven, be a good look
Sing the hook:

In this heartless world that
I live in
I have learned that I can't
Depend on love
It hasn't made me a saint
So I'm a take it all with
Me to the graveyard

The cemetery ain't as new
As the saint it look
They bury ministers there
Right next to straight
Crooks
And nas told niggas they
Was shooting and they'd
Look
Niggas rhyme about
Banging, getting whooped
On facebook
Now put that on your wall,
I put that on the wall
I shot-call and brawl
Quicker than jon wall
I'm killing these niggas,
Bought everything last
Year
And wasn't feeling these
Niggas. I mean I was numb
Last year
Wasn't feeling you niggas.
Came back
To sell a few more mil on
You niggas
Toast! I'm in the phantom,
Nah nigga I ain't scared of
No ghost
Cause all the dead rapper's
Albums are selling the
Most

Some say the 3rd verse
Puts niggas in a hearse
Since I was born jay, guess
I'm the gift & the curse
Lot of bloods out here, but
Nigga I did it first
Still blood out here that's
Why I'm up in the church
Still repenting for my sins,
But not all the way
Cause I just rode up in the
Benz and handed homie
The k
What he gon do with it?
Probably run up on your
Crew with it
That's what I call rap beef,
Luckily I'm through with it
Now I just lean back, '72
With it
Sell it to a nigga down
South, he act a fool with it
Back to them haters and
The stool-pigeons
You're too busy tryna
Judge us stars, but how
Are you living?


[Hook:]
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning
Hood morning

[Verse 1:]
No motherfuckin' typo
That's like Westside, Compton with no psychos
That's like Beverly Hills with no lipo
Fuck around and jack some five, no Michael
Hello, a hundred thousand in the mattresses
I'm Hollywood, yeah, I only fuck actresses
I'm in Cannes, France
You don't know where that shit is
SLR, that's where the ratchet is
I'm in the Amber Rose rolls with Amber Rose hoes
Sorry Wiz, that's how the rap shit, it is
You can take it as a shot or free promo
But everybody in this motherfucker know I'm loco
Anne Rogers [?], knock the man off your polo
Used to scare the shit out you niggers with my old flow
Post-documentary, Comptons most wanted
I'll finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
I'll finish you off like this Corona while I'm yawning
And roll up that OG kush, like motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Me and Skee been doing this
Y'all had Snoop
I'll put the Piru in this
Look at all these fake ass bloods trying to ruin it
Everything red down to the 'Ye Louis kicks
And who is this?
With the all red crucifix
Navy blue Cardinal fitted, I'm a lunatic
Flow like the uzi spit
Hoppin' out the newest shit, windows down
Disturbin' the peace!
Bitch, I'm Ludacris
Used to be on the block moving rocks from 2 to 6
Jimmy Iovine money, feeding on some Jewish shit
Whips transform
Shia Lebouf my newest shit
Caramelo yellow Camaro 22's
And If a nigga run up
I'm a fuck dem up
I sung your new rap niggas, [?]

[Break:]
West coast niggas got crazy game

Man fuck this shit
Mars tell these motherfuckers

[Hook]


[Chorus - Mars:]
From the east to the west coast
You show me love wherever I go

Got them hoes coming let's go
Shawty say I'm a pimp well I guess so
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on

[Verse 1 - Game:]
You niggas know who I is, what kind of car I drive
Kill a California, the door's commiting suicide
Bitches ain't fucking with you unless you in the newest ride
You know me, 5 star nigga do or die
I'm from the home of the [?]
East west north south, niggas getting lost in Los Angeles
We got the baddest bitches on the north campus
Nigga hopping off the Transit, straight off inside a Phantom
Stop at the liquor store, get a swisher hit the dough
Then hit the hood, ay blood what they hitting for
Whole hood tatted up, bandana white side jeans coming out
Busters leave when it's nighttime
15s in the trunk hit me 'fore they see me come
Wear 24s no need to ask where I'm from
Westside home of the perk even 12 year olds put in work
West coast got 'em bang

[Chorus:]
From the east to the west coast
You show me love wherever I go
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on
Got them hoes coming let's go
Shawty say I'm a pimp well I guess so
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on

[Verse 2 - Game:]
31 still banged out shots let 'em rank out
Walk through any crip or blood hood with his chain out
Grandmomma stay on the shore in the same house
Be on the porch Dre beats on with my thang out
That ain't a threat but little do you forget
I was 20 years old rolling up on nigga's sets
Coming straight up out the Jets, Impala sitting wet
Try me in 'em high lows coming up out the Tech
Now I'm getting money big Snoop on the techs
Andre Young on the bottom of my chest
Fresh from the fade to the bottom of my cheques
Matter of fact [?] Cadillac trucks
[?] peanut butter guts [?]
Shit hit the block and post up
Then gather the crew hit childs to toast up
Hoes breaking their neck tryna see me close up

[Chorus:]
From the east to the west coast
You show me love wherever I go
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on
Got them hoes coming let's go
Shawty say I'm a pimp well I guess so
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on

[Verse 3 - Game:]
10 million albums sold I ain't gotta brag
Disrespect my girl or my kids and get a bodybag
AK47 with the sawdy rag, niggas better duck cause it ain't a paparazzi flash

2011 Game banging, y'all copycats
How you throwing a stocking cap and they ain't never cocked it back
Nigga copy that, capiche nigga
Extended clip got 1 bullet for each nigga
Ask nice and I might let you eat nigga
Let you smoke, I keep Kush in the swisher
Keep the blunts rolled up, Phantom 24'ed up
Hop out knockout hoe chest froze up
I be in the back of the club looking like so what
20 bottles 40 grand pro'ly why chose up
Now she in the [?] with her nose up
Pockets 1 0 0 0 0 hold up

[Chorus:]
From the east to the west coast
You show me love wherever I go
One thing I know is

Got them hoes coming let's go
Shawty say I'm a pimp well I guess so
One thing I know is
I'm getting dough, I'm on


[Verse 1]
Red Rose, white cellar
No body, no casket, just blood spillinâ
I ain't a dead President but I love millions
They like âGame, where ya been?â
Yeh Blood chillinâ
But not on no islands or no villaâs
Iâve been lost in Compton with some drug dealers
I bought the Relapse loved it, hit the block hugged it
Em still spit crack the Aftermath oven is a muthafucker
But I ain't seen it in years
Still survive like niggas threw me off the first tier
Still the most gutta, spit the most butta
My albumâs got more game than niggas at the Rucker
Who said Iâll never go Platinum, never drop a Phantom
I park my shit at every strip club in Atlanta
Peace to my nigga T.I. for keeping a level head
Niggas I know flip after doing bids in the feds
So peace to C-Murder, come to my hood see murder
Ain't a street in my city that you ain't heard of
Bought up on the block, no love, black glocks, chrome slugs
and we all fit OJâs glove
And Iâma keep name droppinâ long as my name poppinâ
I mean long as the âcane poppinâ
All white knights, white Range, white pipes, crack in the concrete
Living the [?]
I switch cars like superhead switch stars
You know why, cause Iâm a crook bitch
Fuck ya book bitch
I live life like ain't no money on my books bitch
I write the 16, you sing on the hook bitch
Dickinâ em out, foreign cars Iâm whippinâ em out
Been gang banginâ since the first Pippenâs was out

[Hook]
Me and my infra-red-red
Yeah that's right, my infra-red-red
All I need is my inferared-red
So fuck the gun as long as its infrared-red

[Verse 2]
Same colour as the big apple
Its for my New York niggas that's in the hood clappinâ
I done been through Brooklyn, Queens, BX and Harlem
Only chase money, never chase the stardom
Back to the law, that's how I became a target
Respected in every hood, bullet proof regardless
My glock got no feelings, hollows leave you heartless
Retaliation like tryna swim in the shark pit
Will I ever go at Nas, hell no
Will I ever go at Jay, I donât know
Stay hittin em with pot shots
Ridinâ round tryna figure out who got Pac shot
Cause that got BIG shot, niggaâs try to take out LA like big shot
That's Chauncey Billups, for you niggas who donât understand it
You rap niggas like bitches, pitching underhanded
Itâs like throwin soft balls at Derek Jeter
I keep it hood, never put money in parking meters
like the fuck the US government
I be on some over shit
28 inch rims rubber shit
Roll down the window fuck with this
Roll up the endo, fuck with this
Get it backward, yeah my shit that good
No more medical weed, back to chronic
No more Belvedere, Grey Goose and tonic
Keep a nigga fucked up with a mind state like
Don't get ya nigga fucked up, you know the crime rate up

[Hook]
I hit a nigga with the infra-red-red
Yeah that's right, the infra-red-red
All I need is the inferared-red
Fuck the gun as long as its infrared-red

[Verse 3]
And I can pop a nigga from a rooftop
Or hit âem up close, let âem know that Iâm a fucking killer
like Ghost-face, no trace for the jakes
When it come to the base in the kitchen Iâm a chef like Rae
Nas was like U-God, Iâm like ânah you Godâ, right next to Rza as Iâm lighting up the swisha
Pourinâ out this liquor for my niggas that was bigger than the ditches that they living
That was put in by the triggers, they some niggas with some cold hearts
And you wonder why I walk around like my soul long, black hoody on
Writinâ music like Mozart, Denzel, John Travolta, I play both parts
Drive this raggedy ass Bentely like its a go-kart
Ain't been crazy since I learned how to throw dart
Run up on his muthafucking car, you a dead man
Nah, donât sweat it like Lebron James headband
Empty out the clip on anybody but Redman
I Blackout and you can Blackout 2
But I got night vision on this muthafuckin infra-red-red

[Hook]
Yeah that's right, the infra-red-red
All I need is the inferared-red
Fuck the gun as long as its infrared-red

[Outro]
Niggas know what the fuck it is everytime we do this shit
We do this shit right, nigga
Yeah, shout out to Redman for no reason at all
Cool n Dre them my niggas, my brothers
That's my family for life niggaâs


[Verse 1]
I'm sitting here watching my daughter being born
Feel like I should thank God that nothing went wrong
Back in my days I was headed straight for the graveyard
Running from school cause enemies never stay far
Wear my colors watching colors chasing after my older brothers
Cause they was always into shit, good thing we had different mothers
Playing football in the streets with the homies
And local drug dealers kicking back making money cause the crack fiend
Was always there so I start selling that cane cause nobody never cared
Mama at the post office working that late night shift
Taking care of my sisters cause my daddy wasn't shit
Sweating over the stove and on a school clothes
Open the refrigerator like where did the food go?
Trying to do whatever I can to be a man, hope you understand
Even when shit goes wrong it's part of God's plan, Amen

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

[Verse 2]
Laying here staring at this Doggystyle poster on my wall
Banging Snoop Dogg spinning this basketball, what the fuck is going on?
In a nigga head, all of my homies gone to jail, or they end up dead
Got my first tattoo tear when I was 19, chasing a pipe dreams
Chrenshaw boulevard chilling, that was the night scene
And like the movies, niggas act a fool
When you pushing a beemer, who gives a fuck about a School?
Mom's seta curfew, but I was breaking all the rules
Kicked a nigga out the house so I started forming my crew
Getting a little bigger on my own, in the 12 grade crips scheming on me
Cause they know my trap self made, trying to get by or getting high
That's how I survived, be a leader not a follower, that's how them cowards die
Pay 'em no mind but keep my chrome to the end of time
Feeling like no nigga can see me I think they're going blind

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed

[Verse 3]
Seemed like just yesterday a nigga was only 21
Showing the little homies how to use a fucking gun
Now look what I become, nigga was on the run
From the coptom slums, they right, like father like son
But I'm missing them days when I couldn't roll up a blunt
Bust the windows out of cars just to only drive it once
Yeah them was the days but now a nigga getting paid
Pouring down rose for my niggas in the grave
My nigga Big Will and my homie P D
Feel like yesterday we was just running in the streets
And I swear to God funny how the time fly
And the only thing certain is that we all die
So let your soul fly

[Chorus]
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Wake me up before I'm dead
Don't bury me with monsters in my head, yeah
Monsters in my head, with monsters in my head
Underneath the bed, underneath the bed


[Verse 1]
Today Jimmy Hendrix is motivation
I guess it's time for me to put them 808?s in
Middle finger to them faggot niggas hating
And Sak Pase to all my fucking Haitians
Give me a pimp cup to pour my Rose in
I'm in the same car that Ricky Rozay in
Tell Satan that it's a celebration
So get your hands up, nigga get your hands up
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?
Probably the one of us that really needs to wear his vest
And I'm just shooting my niggas some subliminals
'Cuz he got all the bitches and I be with the criminals
Beat sound like some crazy shit that Tim would do
Now when you see me, I'm the brown Eminem to you
Show you what I'm finna do, but you don't know it's me though
Magic when I shoot, get to boxing like Hedo
Turkoglu, niggas, get to murking you niggas
Hit your block in the Caprice and just circle you niggas
Know what I mean? Think you pheens how I'm serving you niggas
Know what I mean? Think I'm beans how I'm serving you niggas
And it ain't rice and beans when I'm serving you niggas
Punk you in front of your crew, Steve Urkel you niggas
Putting bull shit out, I hope it works for you niggas
And when it don't, come and see me, I got that work for you niggas

[Hook X2]
Like uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Uh (Mr. West, Mr. West!)
Now, which one of us is really Mr. West?

[Verse 2]
He had a Rolls, I had a Rolls too
Eat your money up, you know how them hoes do
Burn rubber, swear to God they gon' love ya
Like rookie cops, can't wait to be undercovers
I'm 6'5?, nigga basketball size
You act like I can't fuck one of them basketball wives
I be a basketball Game, with my basketball dame
Feeling like, Hov, call back, I'm watching basketball dang
Damn, but I ain't talking 'bout dames
I ain't talking bout Hov, I'm just talking bout Game
Ask Ray Allen, they boy got game
Jesus Shuttlesworth, yeah the boy got range-s
In the parking lot, niggas talk a lot
They way they gossiping hip-hop should be a barber shop
Getting cash money baby, why you tryna baller block?
Mad chick, her's, man somebody gotta call the shots

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I guess it's me y'all, the highest on the see saw
Get so much money, why the fuck would I wann be y'all?
Shit, I be everywhere, but I don't ever see y'all
So for the next 12 songs, I'mma fucking R.I.P. y'all

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I hear anger talking, asking how I'm feeling
I'm just happy to be alive, Lord willing
Four albums later, two more children
Feeling like 'Ye, "Mr. West is in the building"
What happened to the competition? Nigga I killed 'em
Can't drink Crystal, the nigga Hov chilled 'em
I'm on this patent rhyme like I know them niggas
Them haters say I fell off? I'm 'bout to show them niggas
Drake and J. Cole them niggas
I sold nine mill, made nine mill, and kept it hood nigga
Just like Drake told a nigga
I made it rain in hundreds like I was Big Meech
I made it rain in hundreds when I was with Meech
Went from a Cutlass with the old front end
To a, um, Benz, stop light jumping
Now I'mma take you back to where I got jumped in
West side Compton, just east of the one ten

[Hook 2]
I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to fuck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club, uh, all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and the power
I just roll weed on your last album
And after that I'm 'bout to fuck your girl for 'bout an hour
Look around the club and all I see is cowards
Mad 'cuz I got respect, the money, and all the power

[Verse 4]
"No one man should have.." 'Ye said that
"Can't knock the:" Naw, Jay said that
"You can thank me:" Naw, Drake said that
"Mind playing tricks on me" Scarface said that
But I'm about to roll this paper plane
Hit the barber shop, get cut before this Laker game
Niggas hate The Game, sometimes I hate the fame
They hate my bitch, they hate my chain
I'm so hood, I might fly to New York and just take the train
On some John Travolta shit, just take the train
So if you in New York at two o'clock, don't take the train
I make niggas dissapear, no David Blaine
I split your whole team up, no Jay and Dame
Fresher than Will Smith was before Jada came
Four albums, twelve cars, but the flow stay the same
Every nigga I dap turn blood, it's like I'm made of flames
Dipping this red flag, like the one I gave to Wayne

[Hook 2]

[Verse 5]
Go Dwight Howard, now watch them hoes run
Soon as the Game over, they back stripping for ones
Had your bitch all in my crib, stripping for fun
Getting head, thinking 'bout cars when I strip 'em for fun
Walk in my closet, throw on my J's, pick up my gun
Spin the block with some some shit that spit quicker than Pun
I respect two East Coast niggas, Biggie was one
If he was living, he'd say that no one is sicker then son, uh
Young gun, bar none, the tightest where I'm from
Roll some much kush, got the leaves sticking to my thumb
As I break it down , bring that six tray around
Banging Nas album, yeah, you can hate me now
Treat beef like haircuts, gotta fade it down
Ran out bars, guess I name-drop Slim and Baby
How can niggas hate on me? 'cuz I get Cash Money
Six bricks in the Aston Martin, that's fast money

[Hook 2]


Yeah blood, let's take these niggas back to 96, 11th grade when a nigga was walking the Compton High School. Cincinnati Red fitted snug on my motherfucking forehead. Nike backpack on, you know like Durant be wearing. Nike straps tighter than a virgin pussy Illmatic in the Walkman, what?

Sitting on the subway they looking like "who is that? "
The boy gutter all hood New York sewer rat
You can never mace me, where Cuda at?
They love me out in Harlem like a ten dollar buddha sack
I spit that I'll Street Blues, yeah Kool G Rap
But my style is big, where the Coogis at?
I said my style is Big now light a L
As I skip to the next track on Supreme Clientele
Ghost to Manhattan, seat reclined in the Aston
Time for glasses cause NY is into fashion
Madison. Square. Garden. Feeling like Spike Lee's squares, Jordans
You squares ain't important
Fresh to death my gear's in a coffin
[Cough cough] Why that nigga coughin'?
Blowing that sour diesel I ain't be here that often

Riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface
I'm just ridin on the A train, listenin to Ghostface
Riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface
I'm just riding on the A train, listening to Ghostface

Pull up in that Derrick Rose hop out number nines or elevens
You niggas is copycats, my style is patent leather
South side of the Chi nigga I ain't packing never
I ain't shy of the Chi, Jay Cutler in cold weather
And all I do is win, 72 and 10
Ball like Mike, Scottie, Dennis Rodman and them
7-4 Chevelle, niggas riding in them
Killers from Cabrini-Green I was riding with them
Pelle jackets niggas out here robbing in them
And even getting coat-jacked ain't Common to him
Keep thinking you Larry Hoover that line'll have you shook
That's that Crack Music nigga forgot I was on the hook
G.D.s, Vice Lords, Four Corner Hustlers
Latin Kings, MCs, all em will fuck with us
Blowing trees like the windy city
Nigga I blow trees in the Windy City

Riding on the L train, listening to Kanye
I'm just riding on the L train, listening to Kanye
I'm just riding in on the L train, listening to Kanye
Said I'm riding on the L train, listening to Kanye

I be in Lil Haiti
First forty eighty
Ain't nothing bout to go down nigga my fam's Zoe Pound
And ever since they locked my nigga Zo down
Everything slow down, but my nigga Ross is on
The homie Khaled put the Boss's on
We blowing orange like the Dolphins home
And we don't floss the chrome
We turn that Wildcat offense on
That New Era fly off ya dome
I'm about to take my talents to South Beach
I don't even go to the games, but got Heat
Ain't no Trickin Daddy, I take a bitch to get some Cuban food
Have a couple mojitos then fuck her like a Cuban do
Riding down Collins in the newest coup
Flo-Rida on the place they think I'm Uncle Luke
Nigga Tony Montana, who the fuck is you?
I'm the all-red side of the Rubik's Cube

Riding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay
I'm just ridin in the fast lane, listening to Rozay
Riding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay
I'm just riding in the fast lane, listening to Rozay


[Intro: Redman]
Redman in the building
Yo Game what's good my nigga

Black Wall Street what's hood
You already know I'm a do it like this my nigga 

[Verse 1: Redman]
Yo I've been hustlin' that's where the fuck Red been

Trigga when the red ring, I got bitches in Washington after my red skin
Red, that's the colour when it came out him
Red, that's the name of the Game album
Red, I wear black I look fly
Red, I'm getting head in the red eye
Red, put in work Red, keep the airport security on high red alert
Red, what's up red
You know red tow up
Red, the colour that Baby and Wayne throw up
Redman, the red necks they can't stand it
I got caught with their daughter red handed
Red, I'm not rich but the paper good
So bring it on a liner, big boy neighborhood 

[Hook: Redman]
Red, yeah yeah boy you know me
Red, that's the colour that my eyes be
Red, I'm on fire homeboy
And that's that the colour that'll show you that I'm hot 

[Verse 2: Game]
You mention Redman the wrong way it's red dots
I put you in the sky nigga, red fox
Yeah Red Rum, clock out the red beam
Give you red wings and I ain't talking about the hockey team
I'm talking red rags hopping out of red rags
With a red bone can't wear any Sinbads
And I've been bad before Michael Jackson was
That's why the red album got a Michael Jackson buzz
I mean I should get a red Michael Jackson glove
And grab my dick, what's happening blood
Or you can catch me on the red carpet
Bitch rocking red bottoms, you can call her red scarlet
And just like the store you can be a red target
My shit butter, you ain't never seen red margarine
Red star with my face make 'em talk a lot
Shut they ass up, red robbies in the parking lot 

[Hook: Redman]
Red, yeah yeah boy you know me
Red, that's the colour that my eyes be
Red, I'm on fire homeboy
And that's that the colour that'll show you that I'm hot


[Verse 1 - Game]
What do you do when life gets too hard for you
Shed tears or is that to hard for you
Iâm just a man, reflection of my family
Meaning you ainât gotta have one to understand me
I got kids, I got friends
Only difference between me and you is I donât care bout this benz
I care about Will he was dying and he needed me
I care about the Grammy they gave Missy they cheated me
But they cheated Drake, they cheated Justin Bieber
Guess America donât like Canada we some fuckin heathens
Game canât watch his mouth that's why his daddy beat him
Same mouth made him millions and now his daddy need him
Finally got a black president look at how they treat him
Kids starvin in Africa why only Oprah feed them?
What happened to the music that I know
I miss it, U2 I guess we feel like Bono

[Verse 2 - Game]
The living, the dead
These Dre beats, my head
My life, featuring Wayne
That was Jayceon, this is Game
Adjacent to the fame ain't chasing a damn thing
So tonight let all of your pain be champagne
I cant tame my killers but I can tell them chill
I might give you a pass depending how I feel
The bi polar bear
They said the end of the World is comin I know itâs here
Cuz California cold this year
Detox, R.E.D
MCâs dead
Kill them softly like Lauren Hill
Skin heads goin K-K-Krazy cuz a nigga in a foreign wheel
We all born to die, some of us born to kill
If that donât wake you up I hope tomorrow morning will

[Verse 3 - Yelawolf]
Never I thought Iâd see the day when I, would roll up in the parking lot
And having people comin up to me for a photograph of the shit I talk about
Yela can I get an autograph Alabama so proud that we just canât wait
Congrats on the Shady deal, any news on the release date?
I told them what I can, shake another hand sign another autograph itâs cool
Got fans gettin inked up, they de-cater to me I love you too
Got 3000 too, the spirit of rock and roll
Long barrell .38 loaded Iâm John Wayne in Geronimo
So I don't really know whats got some these pussies panties in a ball
Cuz I never done shit but get better and believinâ in God
And leavinâ my mom at 15 with a dream and a cross
A cross that I didnât see until I was nailed to it for believinâ at all
That I could ever be accepted the way I saw it
I mean I knew it would be hard but really come on yall
Oh Iâm a redneck? Fuck you tatted on my neck

[Game - Verse 1]
Everybody fucking Amber Rose

LOL hide my bbm ain't got my bbm
Lou Vuiton he be in âtron got em queasy and
My Money ain't Young that's my nigga Lilâ Weezy and âem
I keep one rolled like Wiz Khalifa and âem
Got some college hoes what wanna smoke a swisha sweet with him
They ain't no Lauren Londons but they got that Megan Good
They use that Photoshop to get their ass up out the hood
And its all good with us niggas mayne
I said its all good cause Iâm a trigger man
Yeah she said she wanna have Jayceon kid
I told that bitch you better off with Jason kid

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck I made it
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
She said she wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Who tryna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
She said she tryna have my baby

[Game - Verse 2]
How many bitches in the club just to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the Magnum rappers
Hoping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gonâ Worldstar me I ain't your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose then bitch I ain't finna pay
You donât look like your Twitter avatar anyway
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that's the same bitch that was stalking Fabâ ain't it Trey? (Yup)
And this is how I know youâre giving free head
If you was getting paid, the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain't, she claiming she a saint
But as soon she see Dwight she go hard in the paint
But her girlfriend the type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on it really shouldnât take long
Then she told me that she wanna meet Trey Songz
I told that bitch strip and start singing all Trey songâs

[Chorus]

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I do it cause they love it
If you hate it bitch who give a fuck I made it
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
Plus I do it for the ladies
Somebody say they wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhhh)
She said she wanna have my baby
(Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh)
Who tryna have my baby
She said she wanna have my baby
She said she tryna have my baby


[Verse 1: Game]
Big blunts in the air, I don't even care
Spilling Ace of Spades on my all white airs
Stunting in my J's
I got every pair, they put out since '85
Cus a nigga bout his gear
Hoes all up in my ear, cus I'm stylin'
Try to go bottle for bottle with us,
Can't do it, money we running through us
So competition throw the towel in
We over here, with fireworks up in the air
Bitches with good hair, cus you know we about to spark
Bobby Ray just walked in, Wiz about to park
The party bout to start, jewelry glowing in the dark
We got all the bitches wet, Skylar Diggins from the [?]
And you know your boy is sharp, cus she in my bed
I tell her take her clothes off, and open her legs
Keep them Louboutins on when she giving head
Cus you already know my favorite colour RED!
I'm getting bread while I'm

[Chorus: Game]
Standing on the corner
Washing my low low
I got my dime in the crib, I'm in my Polo
Soon as your boy hit the streets, you know that I'm clean
So fresh and so clean, Outcast know what I mean
I throw that Andre 3000, one in the changer
And I don't ride through the hood, with out one in the chamber
You know I used to broke but: now nigga I'm getting it

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
As I roll up up, I sit back and laugh in amazement
As how this all started in bottom of a basement
Back when I got started, nigga saying "your shit is basic"
Now when you mention me, you must say Grammy nominated
All these haters drunk of hate, they basically wasted
Call a cab for these niggas, cus they ain't gonna make it
Can somebody please tell me just where Bobby Ray is
Well he's probably faded, probably in a spaceship
Probably outside of his mind, cus you know he crazy
But I kind of dig his style, it's pretty contagious
Man them: probably doing him all kind of favors
I mean, it's gotta be absolutely outrageous
Well, I couldn't tell you what it is
More people tell me that they down, the bigger that I get
But I just keep doing my thang, cruise control in my own lane
And let these suckers complain

[Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I'm standing on the corner, watching the world go
I got my dime in the crib, rolling up that dojo
Soon as your boy hit the stage you know the screaming
It's that pandemonium, if you know what I mean
I throw that Eastside up, Compton to Decatur
And on the Westside, I hit the homie Game up
I used to be unknown
But now niggas is listening, now niggas is listenin

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Big money talk, big joint to spark
These Jordans on my feet, that's how big money walk
Shawty give me head, like she don't need body parts
Running my city like the King of New York
Poppin' champagne, hit him with the cork
Eating so good, nigga need a fork
And I ball hard, nigga need a court
The way little mama give me brain, I swear she must have been a dork
Duhhhhh, you know me I keep one rolled up
Smoking with my bitch from overseas, where my Porsche from
And these hating niggas get no love
I be rolling weed, getting rich, fucking they bitch
Letting you spend all of your m, sending her on trips
I meet her there, you know, 'cus you smell the weed in her hair
You worried bout me keeping it player, instead you failed
Treated her fair, don't need to look, she in the air

[Chorus 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Standing on the corner, talking that shit
You ain't really saying nothing, just hating on pimpin
Every time I'm in my car I'm smoking that green
Even though this real life, it's like a movie scene
I ain't in the club
If I don't blaze up
It don't matter where I go, I'm throwing my gang up
Nobody used to know me but but
Now a nigga famous, now a nigga famous


[Verse 1]
Back on the block, nigga, chains on the rocks, nigga
Used to move yay, I should throw up the Roc, nigga
Back with the Doc, so I just throw up the Mag
Up 2 fingers: they donât get the ski mask!
This is body bag shit, that open the bag spliff
Coke in your lungs, a muthafuckin monster is what Iâve become
Balls hotter than Pablo Escobarâs stove
Got the Venice Queensbridge Escobar flow so..
Brat! Brat brat! 50 roundsâll knock you niggas down
Ben Affleck from The Town. This is my town nigga
King, mayor, all that. Niggas better fall back
Bullets in your ballcap. P-U-S-S-Y: thatâs what I call cats
Hardcore, die today if it brought Biggie Smalls back
Eyes low, 75 eighths, black war hat
Red Album, bitch, everything else all-black
Eyes low, 75 eighths, black Wall hat
Red Album, nigga, everything else all-black

[Hook]
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They donât run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
I run them down, they wanted now

Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They donât run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing I hunt em down
Gun âem down, yeah a hundred rounds

[Verse 2]
Niggas better break bread and niggas better play dead
I step in front of the beam and take it off of Dre head
Everythingâs straight red: my bitch, my car, the tip of my cigar
My Philly hat, my scarf
Yâall niggas pushing light weight
Ryan Russell niggas falling down, tryna put a hand up in my face
The fucking boosters in danger, ainât a mic safe
Mike Bibby, Mike Vick, nigga, Mike Jake
4th album, cause I do my shit the right way
And like Dre the fans gon wait, so have a nice day
Iâmma have a nice bitch sitting in the white 6
Coldest rapper alive: I write with an ice pick
And Iâm write sick, meaning that my bars ill
Bout to fuck the world up, nigga, Iâm an oil spill
In the foriegn wheel, paint job orange peel, nothinâ like Picasso, bitch
But I draw steel

[Hook]
Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They donât run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing when we come around
I run them down, they wanted now

Niggas keep saying that they run this town
They donât run this town, nigga I run this town
Niggas keep playing I hunt em down
Gun âem down, yeah a hundred rounds

[Verse 3]
I ainât never gave no fuck, why would I start now?
Everytime I get on the track, itâs black hawk down
I declare war, pulling niggasâ cars now
And I ainât gotta fuck Sarah Palin to lay the law down
Birds: knock em all down
You could push record now
Used to ball like Chris Paul, Iâm John Ward now
Still bang Dogg Pound, I donât like how yâall sound
Gun butt a nigga in the grill, try to floss now
I set the bridge on fire â try to cross now
Still fuck Benzino, I donât care who run The Source now
I got magazines inside of magazines
Walk up, laid everybody on the porch down
Kill the drums, cause the track is a corpse now
Spread my fingers when I chew [?] from Georgetown
Think itâs a movie than itâs AI Georgetown
But if it ainât a [?]
Iâm busting with the 4 pounds


This then is stereophonic sound, sound sculptured in space (Taylor made)

Shits here is my uncle Otis (Taylor made)
(T-t-taylor made) (Taylor made)

This shit for my uncle Otis

Here's a dome shot to this nigga named Otis
Niggas think they the coldest but nigga you just the oldest
Niggas be chasing they youth but it's gone
Yo 'Ye, this nigga ain't even wanna put you on
And then he turned around, put on Sean
But forget to tell em Benny Han Han don't sell no fucking Wonton's
I don't wear Sean John, but fuck with that Ciroc shit
Tupac back, well Hit Em Up on some Pac shit
Who run the world? Jayceon
Will Kelly Rowland come and be my Motivation
If you invented swag then I invented gangsta
Got one in the chamber, the Throne is now in danger
And I don't wear no Gucci Gucci Fendi Fendi Prada
I'm Charles Louboutin, you niggas ain't sayin' nada
Lil white bitch better stay in ya place
You call me a nigga, I'ma put the K in ya face

Shades blocking the haters

And Lupe'll souffle half you muthafuckers

[Verse 1: Game]
My car, my bitch nigger, everything major
My niggers they shoot like Indiana Pacers
Indiana hoosers don't get more about the laser
What your fucking team up, meaning [?]
Red phantom pink slip, everything paid for
Black 24's lips fatter than Fantasia's
Had a bitch from Asia, put her up on the chronic
And her name Su Woo, isn't it ironic?
My bars Grey Goose and tonic and when I vomit
Respect me like Muhammed, but nigger I'm not Islamic
All about my profit, angel in the cockpit
Devil in the rear view, heaven's the only option
Angel on the hood like reverend runs [?]
The day I'm feeling good riding in his holy ghost
Hate me like I'm god's son wanna see you deceased
Break the 6th commandment if you run upon this Jesus piece

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Wow my whip like wow, I wish like chick like mic iced out
My rims like wow, I'm smoking right now

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Balling, like Amauri
I'm not an athlete but it's a track beat
I'm on a great run, the world love me
So love to hate me, it's all gravy
So icy, so [?] ice cream on my face it ain't your face nigger
I'm on my grind constant, yeah my grind custom
While you cross counters, we cross continents
Yellow diamonds on my wrist it looking like an omelette
I'm not a pumpkin, I trap [?]
I got irons, squares for you
Power for goons, prepare for you
So where the move blood I'm tattooed [?]

[Verse 3: Game]

Chains, Gucci, light it up like Vegas
Down goes Frasier, my shooters like [?]
And we keep that new pain run when you see them lasers
We bring them trailblazers smoking kush from Malaysians
Still trapping like back then the iPhones were pagers
Click clapping, what's happening 4 5 at you haters
Keep yapping, I'm clapping, T.I. know we Takers
Nigger I don't give a damn [?] cellophane
Get your boss on your phone cause we don't fuck with middle men
Hit your boss at your home fucking with my middle man
Where I'm from it's off at your dome for just a kilogram
Gucci they talking about that tattoo up your face
Must of forgotten them boys you shot nigger murder was the case
This summer is ours ain't a motherfucker safe

[INTRO]
My mama took me to Sam Goody's
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
Don't fuck with Game

I like 50 Cent
He reminds me Spongebob
And Tony Yayo is Blues Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche

I went down one of them Bodaga shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boom box
Thought I was 'bout to be on some radio Raheim shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wallstreet for life now
GGG-UNOT!

[GAME]
300 Bars and Running
Just loan me your ears for 15 minutes
Walk with me

Here the breakdown, pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggaz they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah, standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggaz that rapped in Philly?
See them niggaz with the soonies leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Compton camcorder said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheese steak, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was Ready To Die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Label's signing many things, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block
So I don't feel threatened when Ludacris say he coming for the #1 spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top
You can hate me or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, we win, but we ain't lonely we pop
You sell records but a GGG-u not!
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mr. CCC who hot
Tony Yayo I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300 C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you black out before you see the cops
I ain't hot top for colors, I'm from Cedar Block
So I got my hot tops that make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe you dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the strap
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggaz when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece duece to your hat
Then call up the pigs, tell them the rooster's back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who can rap
It's about when the Ruger clap, is Rufus back?
I see what you thinking, you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back, thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go!
Drop them off, then the sound like Esko
I'm a say 'he hit me first' if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a ??
Now that's the eulogy, beef is kinda foolish see
Niggaz running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm 10 years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga I pop mines
How you gon' drop Olivia, you only drop dimes
I knew you changed, when you started sleeping in that vest dog
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggaz make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw them off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over, career is over
We in QB, banging CNN in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's Capone and NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent you want a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on DVD
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks repeat after me
I'm a G-Unit toy soldier
On Sesame street doing voice overs
Bitch ass nigga need a rhyme dictionary, to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch, with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio, when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50 tryna borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhymes
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom, and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he ain't never bust no cap
Like Father, Like Son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning I couldn't trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all, if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggaz saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, but it in the store the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Running
And I beef with any nigga, say my name muthafuck I'm gunnin'
You can put it on skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordon shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Bloods, Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside NY, in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'Cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggaz on them CD's and tapes
Ask them to scratch a record, you will see he fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheese cake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant replay
Not the instant replay
I mean the machine that G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
Bitches only for your shit just a lil bit
niggaz only for your shit just a lil bit
On my album 50 helped me just a lil bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots
Get him a head band, to cover the holes in his head
He a dead man for thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear air max for the game
Unless you one of the Bloods, or a Latin king
'Cause if your left with the Aryans your ass will sting
And your cell mate is a 25 to lifer
They will stab you in Folsom then fuck you on Rikers
And Life Goes On
Now back to the coward of the hour who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move I'm blasting your ass to the last one
Ten shots from the Mack empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hearse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-Hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a hemmy in it, Game got a Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the Old King, that New York had
Who's this fake nigga, on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he ain't the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talking about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after wanksta
Get Rich or Die Trying, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
nigga I'll smack that ho like I'm Jackie-O
'Cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands, or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike airs and the matching socks fitted

Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord Givth, if Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
niggaz hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the DA waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the SWAT car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimum pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah this ain't no subliminal Jay
The summer too hot, and I want the winter to stay
'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like that wit Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton Swap meet, to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they they calling all cars
'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C.
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50

Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in this nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock, like ??
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Day on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds
They kicked me out of G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint, shit
I be mad, I ain't, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
I'm in the hood politican, Impala liftin'
And I keep a black .45 on the side of my prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that so muthafucka move back
While I do B.I.G. and 'Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss ya'll, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap, why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They won't know which hole to patch up, when the 'K' clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash nigga?
Say my name now that's your fucking ass nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burial, it's when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe, when it's war he pull out butter knifes
Motherfucker I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on Tha Row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the NO
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch, and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands, and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did that shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him The Boy is Mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop, when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beat boxed
Got 20 bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga fuck Reeboks
I'm fly like a Hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new 'Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling fuck the world, on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever motherfucker, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the peace, capiche (sp?)
Let 'em rest in peace
From west to east the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making, and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder
Not a nigga nor a hood rat bitch can stop me from taking it over
This is crack music, go get the baking soda
300 Bars and Running, nigga the wait is over
I'm gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone gone


All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

Lemme tell you a story bout these punk rap niggaz
Play tough but they whole fuckin life made up
I'ma start wit 50 cause I used to roll wit him
He neva smoked weed so how could I blow wit him
Shoulda knew he was a fag by the way his clothes fit him
Tight G Unit jeans brought out the ho in him
Had one lil girlfriend and that was fixed
Somebody musta told Vivica her boyfriend like dick
Lloyd Banks knew, he told me that shit
I told Buck and Buck told me he ridin wit his clique
So I start ridin wit Fat Joe and Kiss
Made a good choice cause afta that Yayo bricked
So I gave away my chain and decided to keep movin
Now I'd ratha burn in hell then yell G Unit
Thats the truth nigga word to Seagle
Sleep on The Game and wake up to a gold desert eagle

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

All I need in this world is my bitch, my bitch
My glock nine, my fo five
My shotgun, I'll kill you nigga

50 what happened to ya movie, the soundtracks
Chicken Little killed you niggaz you'll never bounce back
I paid 19 dollars to see that shit
My bitch said you was naked I ain't see that shit
You and Olivia in the shower, my bad that was Terrence Howard
A lil Hustle & Flow and a damn coward
I had to sit there for 80 minutes
The best actor in the movie was the baby in it
This ain't New Jack City and it can't be Menace
The worst actor in the world, you made the Guinness
I made G-Unot and that made you finished
I put two quarters in and I played you niggaz
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Fuck Mobb Deep the lil thugs turned sissy
And Mase traded holy water for some Formula 50
Tell niggaz come get me, I got a glock nine
I'ma window shoppa cause I ain't got drop a dime


Oooooh

(The Game)
That's Lloyd Bank's momma singin'
You betta tell your boy to keep his mouth closed
Or he gon' get a black tux
And a free wake
How my bow tie lookin'?
You ready?
Let's go

When I see Lloyd Banks it's goin', (down, down)

Automatic rifle

From Thirty feet away he fell, (down, oooh well)
Touch kids like Michael

Fuck G-Unit nigga i'm not (down, oooh well)
Used to ride wit' em'
Slice up the pie wit' em'
Got kicked out the group
'cause I wasn't gon' die wit' em'

And that's how it went, (down, down)
At Hot 97 we came, (down, oooh well)
Had Thirty niggas wit' me
Niggas that sport the Dickies
Hoppin' out of cabs
We just want to talk to 50

We wanna know what's goin' (down, down)
Security pulled heat it went, (down, oooh well)
Had to shake the block
I ain't tryna' face the cops
Heard a couple shots
Then I seen the shell cases drop

Told P-nut to get, (down, down)
I looked back and saw my nigga goin', (down, oooh well)
I said,"homie we can't leave em'"
What if my nigga dyin'
Soon as we hit Houston then
We heard police sirens

Oh shit!, it's goin', (down, down)
Guns out, they tellin' him to get, (down, oooh well)
He on both knees
Blood squirtin' out his jeans
Catch 22 should I go to jail or flee the scene

Either way it's goin', (down, down)
So I hopped in the truck and went, (down, oooh well)
Broadway in a black suburban
One thing on my mind
Go hard til' them fags get murdered

'cause he tried to get my nigga shot, (down, down)
But he survived and now he goin' (down, oooh well)
To the station
Police at the Double-U waitin'
On me to arrive and now I gotta shake em'

They wanna take a nigga, (down, down)
We on the same elevator goin', (down, oooh well)
Dodger fitted
Got the Hova lean
So they ain't notice me
Now they mad as fuck
And gotta watch my Range Rover leave

Hit the 95 and head, (down, down)
It's to Philly so i can lay it, (down, oooh well)
Catch the first thing smoking back the L-A-X
Kicked up my Air Nikes
Then I slept the whole flight

Had a dream about it goin', (down, down)
Woke up and saw my plane comin', (down, oooh well)
Missed the palm trees
Sunshinin' everyday
New York's my second home
But i'm from in L.A

And i hold shit, (down, down)
The throne was empty so I sat, (down, oooh well)
And just handled my biz
Theres two sides to every westside story
And I just tell it like it is

And that's how it went, (down, down)
On my son that's all that went, (down, oooh well)
So stop tellin' them lies to all them motherfuckin' magazines
And radio stations nigga you know what happened

Me and Lloyd Banks aint, (down, down)
Keep talkin' shit, i'll lay you, (down, oooh well)

You niggas ran out the backdoor nigga
All I wanted to do was holla man
To see what was what

Y'all was too fuckin' scared to come, (down, down)
You've been to Compton, you know how I get, (down, oooh well)
So fuck y'all nigga
And it's like that
For life


[Kanye West]
Yo whassup this is Kanye-to-the
Y'know good music is in the building
The Roc is in the building
I just called, called to shoutout my dawg Game
Chillin in the streets right now
That "Dreams" joint is crazy
We gotta get, get started on our next joint my nigga
Holla

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream...
(Was it all a dream?) [2X]
(Was it all a dream?) Dream (dream) dream (dream) dream
(Was it all a dream?) ([Jay-Z:] "It was all a dream") [3X]

[Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream; I used to read Word Up magazine
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack - Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin weed and bamboo, sippin on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match
(Jay-Z: "It was all a dream") Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far 
Now I'm in the {dream} cause I rhyme {dream}
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowin up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's {dream}

[The Game]
Aaliyah had a {dream} Left Eye had a {dream}

[Notorious B.I.G.]
And if you don't know, now you know
It was all a dream ([Jay-Z:] "It was all a dream") [4X]
It was all a dream


[50 Cent]
That'll be the end of 50 Cent or Shady/Aftermath
I'm movin' forward in my career
As Dre had got creatively tied up on to The Game project
If he's confused [echo]..

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Comin' up he was confused his mama kissin' a girl
This shit happen in my household I might hurl
Daddy ain't around probably out doin' crack
And Scarface told me a snitch is just like a rat
Wanna live good so he snitched on thugs
Somebody must have told him steroids wasn't a drug
Walk around town everyday in that snitch coat
Put niggaz behind bars but homie that ain't dope
Boy toss and turn in his sleep at night
Wake up in the morning watch Cops and Miami Vice
Different day same snitch ain't nothin' good in the hood
He'd run away from New York and never come back if he could

[Chorus - The Game]
Hate it or love it the underdogs on top
And he gon tell and go runnin' to the cops
Go 'head snitch on me, I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin no where so dey come and get me
[x2]

[Verse 2 - The Game]
G-G-G-G-Unot!
On the grill of my low rider
Guns on both sides right up by the gold wires
I'll fo' five 'em
Kill Banks on my song and really do it
that's the true meaning of a ghost rider
Ten g's will take Yayo out his Air Forces
Believe in me homie I know all about losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colours be cautious
One phone call will have his body broke in parts and
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my 'lil nigga Rob, got killed for his Barkley's
That's ten years I told Buck in '05
I catch 50 let me tie up my Air Max '95's
Told you niggaz when I met you I'ma rider
And if I got a die I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my grandma died
Now I'm goin' back to Cali
Same Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - The Game]
From the beginning to the end, losers lose
When it's win this is real we ain't gotta pretend
The cold world that we in
It's full of pressure and pain
Enough of that faggot now listen to Game
Told Dre from the gate I'd carry the heat for ya
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G'd for ya
Put Compton on my back when you was in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my NWA gold
And had the whole crowd yellin' "FUCK YAYO"
So niggaz betta get up outta mine
Fo' I creep and turn violater into Colombine
And I'm raps MVP, dont make me remind y'all Yayo was NBC
That nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at me cuz Olivia got a new boyfriend
It seems like ya 'lil rat turned out to be a mouse
Beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly south
Even 50 Cent can vouch, when the doubts was out
I gave G-Unit mouth-to-mouth

[Chorus]


[50 Cent]
I never said anything, I never take anything back

[Young Buck]
Well you kinda heard me speaking
"You ain't a crip like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game"
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
but now, you know alot of these dudes jump in the game
and they rap artists, and that's exactly what they is
but they not what they say they are when they rap it

[T.I.]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
they ain't runnin the damn thing with they mouth
no doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
but in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
it's a given, and it ain't cause what I'm doin for a livin'
it's more because of what I'm doin how I'm livin
not to mention when I'm rappin, I'm just hurtin niggaz feelings
And still chillin on somethin that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
but while the crack was in the house, the record sale went thru the ceiling
so say what you want, and do what you please
but for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
so niggaz'll come and look for you if you sneeze
or even breathe the wrong way
you better do what the song say and be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the South
I'm a king - just respect it and keep my name out'cha mouth

[The Game]
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
but, they ain't runnin the damn thing in the West
that's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin they minds
stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
my crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
and it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
so nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin drug dealin, some people say I'm a villain
went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin millions
so watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
cause to me, murderin wack mc's is somethin like a disease
top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
and where I'm from, niggaz throwin up B's and C's
so make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say
and be easy, else it'll be a long day

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - impala with the top chopped off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech

[The Game]
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
or get your ass layed back
Keep your eyes off my throne and your hands off my crown
or get your ass layed back
Fuckin with Black Wall Street & Pimp $quad Click Get

[T.I.]
layed out like a drunk, on the late-late
so haters hate, the hell with all the hearsay
from wednesday to tuesday, T.I.P. act a fool, hey

I'm a king - bank rolls in the pockets of my jeans
I'm a king - you pussy niggaz couldn't see me in your dreams
I'm a king - top topic of all of your magazines
I'm a king - head of the body, leader of the team
I'm a king - remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king - a Bentley coupe with the top knocked off
I'm a king - I'm connectin nationwide but in the West
I'm a king - disrespect it I hit your brains with the tech


[Justo]
What up? I be the one they call Justo if you didn't know
Trying to check my man DJ Skee with his new mix-tape
Pick it up you square, you heard what I'm said?

[The Game]
It's another sad day in Hip-Hop
We lost another one of our brothers, Justo Faison
We love you, and we'll always miss you
Mix-Tape King, forever

[Chorus]
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo
We'll always love you Justo

[Verse 1]
I picked up my pen four years from the date
Never thought I'd be rapping, and be signed to Dre
Never been to New York, I had to find a way
So I dropped 40 bars on the Clue mix-tape
On the Birdman beat, then my name started buzzing
Aftermath's young gun, and now everybody love him
I hooked up with Gavin, Foxy's little brother
He took me to Kay Slay, and Slay put me on the cover
Drama King, I should of known, 'cause all of the sudden
MC's calling my name and I'm beefing with Joe Budden
That beef came and went, I got at him over Colors
Then caught him at Def Jam and found out, it was nothing
Looked back at my career, staring out at the City
Thinking about the biddin' war between Dre and Diddy
If I was signed to Bad Boy, would 50 be on the Math?
Probably not but maybe Justo wouldn't have crashed

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I remember when Funk Flex first heard me flow
And sway let me freestyle on the wakeup show
Spit over 100 bars then Miss Jones started to host
That's when they start showing me love on the east coast
Then more people found out I was with Dre
And at bodegas I'm on 9 outta 10 of the mix-tapes
I'm workin' on my album and the world can't wait
Cover of the Vibe, and I ain't even have a release date
Then I met Justo he told me if I stay hungry
I'd go platinum and nobody can take that from me
He joked about my rap beefs, I thought it was funny
Gave him a pound then slid him 200 Bars and Runnin'
Went upstairs to change, got dinner at five
Went to Houston's and that's the first time I met Nas
Had Billboard with me and two months later he died
So this is what it sounds like when thugs cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Markin' off days on the calendar I can't even sleep
Like a convict, waitin' on January 18th
When the Documentary dropped, it flooded the streets
My mix-tape buzz made me gold the first week
Double platinum in two months
Record labels getting' scared
Cause the kid from Compton selling like Sunny and Cher
Mix-Tape awards came around, glad I was there
To get my award, Mix-Tape Artist of the Year
Stepped on stage, and Justo let 'em know
You might as well crown him the new kind of the West Coast
A couple of months passed we ain't speak
My Sidekick went off "Justo Rest in Peace"
I let everybody from Snoop to Busta know
A car crash just claimed the life of Justo
They say the good die young, if you know like I know
Live your life to the fullest one day we all gotta go

[The Game]
Give a moment of silence
If you're wearing a Fitted Cap take it off
If you driving, pull over to the side of the road
We lost an underground legend
Justo Faison
Mix-tape King
Rest in Peace


[50 Cent (The Game)]
Okay, whassup its ya boy 50 Cent (Yeah)
It's goin down right here you heard me? (I'm craaazy)
Off of The Massacre's (Aftermath)
Check it out (G-Unot!)

[Chorus - The Game]
Bitches only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
Niggaz only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
The hood only feel ya shit just a 'lil bit
Stop the singin' lets get back to some killa shit
[x2]

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Step up in the club they like who you wit
I'm signin' Dr. Dre not G-Unit
Red rag in my pocket feelin' old school
You forgot how bullets feel I'ma show you
I'm a gangsta I do what I want to
Ya time is up nigga I dun warned you
You got the police witchu nigga don't trip
I got a box of donuts and a whole clip
When it's time for beef he get his drink on
Animal Rights said kill 'em with that mink on
I'ma kick it by your car 'till it's time to go
And I won't leave the scene 'till the police show
Cause

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - The Game]
Remember 50, comin' out ya stereo
Sounded gangsta 'till he switched his flow
How many times I try to get you to hit the smo
Stop lyin' to the people you don't twist the dro
My tech, is fit, my clip is long
And the bloods, and crips, is on you dawg
They musta heard that you a ho
Got G-Unit airbrushed on ya top
Bring the pump in the club cause I'm hurtin' the kid
And I do these rap beefs all the time mayne
They say at summer jam, I turned it out
But Kanye and Hova killed it without a doubt
The rat came out dancin' like a pro, mayne
Punched him in the face the crowd was like "oh mayne"
Four months ago I was yellin' G-Unit
'Till I found out the nigga 5-0 was a snitch
Now

[Chorus]

[50 Cent (The Game)]
Produced by Scott Scorch (Scott Scorch!)
Scott Scorch (Scott...I mean Scott Sc, Sc, Sc)
Scorch

[The Game]
It's Scott Storch you dumbass bitch
S-T-O-R-C-H
Storch mothafucker, Storch
Learn how to talk you fuckin' bitch
That's that muhfuckin hole in ya jaw huh?
Scott Scorch
Learn how to say a nigga name you dumbass faggot
Don't even know how to talk, and that's the reason..

[Chorus]

We'll probably do some shit that'll scare the shit outta y'all
Nas y'all

[Verse 1: M.O.B.]
Money Over Bitches, yeah
Watch it, when I hop out, 38 and a knockout
The studio on lockout like the day they let 'Pac out
Back to drop out, store the blockout
Homies say the cops out, stash spot got popped out
Grind 'til I clock out, tick tock out
Shake shakin them haters off, runnin a hot route
Get my Mike Williams on, homey do not doubt
#1 in Southern Cal', knowhatI'mtalkinbout?
Suckers up top on, shut 'em out of the pros
But runnin the fo'-fo' open them do's
Run and gun how I 'em them shows
When they see he can ball, let the cold flow open them hoes
I'm here, so go against my arrival is suicidal
Homicidal dynamic certifiedal my mob or die crew
You niggaz been lied to, we the best that did it
since Big was wit it and don't forget it (M.O.B.)

("It's the real..") Money Over Bitches, the new edition
("This.. is a DJ Ski exclusive")
("The real..") Money Over Bitches, and we the new edition
("Hip-Hop..")

[Verse 2: M.O.B.]
Yeah, yeah, it's the mob nigga, ha ha
Ay Tec I get these G-Unit niggaz trippin
Talkin shit 'bout niggaz like they can't come up missin
Ay look I'm here so you don't get the story twisted
When I catch him slippin I'ma gun him down homey pay attention
You niggaz fin' to pay a visit, with readmission
What'chu know about cemetaries and morticians?
Know dat, can't run or escape like lo-jacks
With bullets that I aim cock spit and throw back
I'm Mr. Lemonhead on your block in a gold 'llac
Escaped from Death Row so stop askin where Suge at
You niggaz need your minerals, vitamins, three chemicals
Lyrically invincible spittin repeated principles
I'm killin you, I ain't feelin you meanin a war
Cause when we mob through the door, e'rybody on the floor
It's the mob [echoes]


[Verse 1]
Yeah yo I walk through the valley of death
vest on teflon now I'm approached In my hurricane sweats
black chrome on my shoulder, big wheel till It's over
he never got to see me put black chrome on the rover
readin your obituary, wishin we never met
so I wouldn't have to shed tears or wake up In cold sweats
lookin at this bottle of hennessy wishin you never left
wishin I chased your Monte Carlo down and gave you my vest
or better yet, I wish they never let you out
and I never got that phone call tellin me that you out
wish you never signed the release form
I wouldn't have to clear this sample
or use this track to say rest In peace for him
you wanted to know If Dre and Em felt you?
they did and before I could tell you somebody killed you
I feel pain for everybody whoever knew the real you
call Nas let him know I got a Ill Will too

[Chorus x2]
My nigga, If you look In the mirror
would you see things clearer?
my nigga who I live, who I live for
my nigga
and you know where you headed
do you know who you are
and why you do the things you do?
my nigga

[Verse 2]
Niggaz politicin' wanna know why I'm rhymin different
my best friend got murdered nigga my mind is different
If you ain't never spend no time In prison
you can't understand these bars or the lines I'm spittin
niggaz rilin' me up, lets go find the victim
I can't do It homie thats the reason shyne In prison
and through devine Intervention
10 plus years doing crime In the trenches
multiplied by the time that we spent In the kitchen
I'ts a life worth of hard livin
cuban cigar tippin, 12th grade ditchin
purple served by the jar sippin
If you lost a homie, you know freindship is God given
I done seen the church so much, you'd think I was born Christian
I done seen more dead bodies than a mortitian
seen niggaz In and out of county blues like they was born crippin
so I'ma keep on livin
cuz when I'm gone niggaz ain't gon do shit but fuck my bitch and pour liqour

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3]
What If you was me? and you had to sit through an entire funeral
while the pastor readin your homeboyz eulogy
I'm already dead, what the fuck you gon do to me?
keep talkin shit I'll empty my clip and G-unity
gimme a minute to say my grace with God
I see your face in the mirror
I came a long way to talk and tell you
your moms is missin you
your pops is missin you
just saw your baby pictures In your grandmothers living room
Face is missin you
homie Wink is missin you
thank God you left us memories and songs to listen to
Vale is missin you
the hood is missin you
let my son graduate high school, and I'ma come visit you
the world is missin you
Eminem was feelin you
Dre said he felt your vibe the little time he spent with you
pour the henny out cause he ain't here in the physical
they say real men don't cry but nigga I'm missin you


You niggaz is soldiers man, fuckin toy soldiers
Yeah get in line cadet; atten-HUT!
Yayo you punk-ass bitch
I know you can't wait to get off house arrest nigga
So you can run the fuck outta New York, you faggot

[Chorus]
Niggaz love to play The Game, with 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
Why you tryin to play The Game, with 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
Can't play The Game with only 50 Cent, 50 Cent, 50 Cent
So why you tryin to play The Game with only 50 Cent
Come back when you got a couple dollars, holla

[Verse 1]
You gon' need more than 50 Cent to play this Game
Nigga hatin on me cause I'm doin my own thang
I'm ain't Lloyd Banks bitch I don't share your brain
I was in the fast lane before the G-Unit chain
You was hatin on Ja cause him and Irv went pop
Now yo' ass run around singin the "Candy Shop"
After "Westside Story," I took your fans
I seen it for myself, that bitch Olivia's a man
I got word from the wise, nigga you dead wrong
Stole the real 50's name and wouldn't pay for his headstone
Nigga got mad when "How We Do" start climbin
Actin like a bitch cause he "Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'"
Got niggaz locked up, you a snitch in Queens
Told 'em Touch shot 'Pac then rated out Supreme
But on the rizzeal, I'm talkin about you and me
Toe to toe, five-oh-C-E-N-T, faggot

Banks is a bitch, 50 is a bitch
Yayo is a bitch, Buck is a bitch
Olivia's a bitch (Jersey Devil exclusive) no
Olivia's a man, ha ha, God damn

[Verse 2]
You reported more names than the evening news
I guess now Reebok makin cement shoes
Yayo the only real motherfucker from the street
You swingin on me like you want five heartbeats
Okay 1, 2, 3 4 flatline
If you say you wrote my shit one mo' time
You ain't a hood nigga you "Got Rich and Stopped Tryin'"
Jimmy scared Chris Lighty and Jay stop lyin
You a snitch, what'chu know about movin in silence
Even N.Y.P.D. can't deny it
The life of your story is fuckin Vivica
But your baby momma left you cause you couldn't get it up, bitch

Yayo went to jail, Banks sold a mill'
Then Buck sold a mill' then 50 gave a deal
to a bitch named Olivia who titties ain't real
Now they all hidin behind the police shield

[Chorus]

[Outro]
G-G-G-G-G-you niggaz ain't shit, bitch-ass niggaz
I told you this shit was real nigga
This is Fat Rat nigga, motherfucker
All you get up on there and sing a few hooks
Nigga and you wanna claim a nigga fame, nigga
You was Ashanti, you bitch-ass nigga, fuck is you talkin 'bout?
You wrote somethin nigga, the real is the real nigga
Black Wallstreet nigga, THE Black Wallstreet nigga
Gon' tell yo' bitch-ass nigga
I ain't gon' get up on this mic and play them games nigga
I told my nigga let me get that last 16 nigga
I'm rappin right now nigga, but I'm spittin the real nigga
You know who I'm talkin to nigga
50! Nigga, bitch-ass nigga
BLACK WALLSTREET NIGGA
Brazil and Wimelton, what block you on nigga?
We'll be there! What block you on?
Scary-ass nigga, fuck this shit man
Niggaz woke me up with that bullshit nigga


[The Game]
Bells, it's the new "12Play"
Bells (Game y'all) throw the pussy like Elway
Bells, I wanna see your tail shake
Bells, when you hear R. Kel' say

[R. Kelly]
Players only
We where them tricks be jerkin they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
They come from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin but - players only
Where the players be spendin a lot of dough
Honies got ass bouncin on the flo'
This is how we do behind the player's do'

[The Game]
I'm still fresh like uhh, Impala uhh
Trey's young gun still ridin the bass, drum
(Sha) Four times plati-num
"Hate it or Love It," I'm still number - one
Still in the hood one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in her tongue
Compton R., Kelly found her in the slums
Shakin that rump, both hands on her pumps
Send her home with me, I'll have your girl yellin UHHH
Kels my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have, fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen the penthouse at The Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it girrrrl

[R. Kelly]
Girl you on a mission
Up in the club, shuttin down competition
That way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close handle yo' business
Now make your booty go
(Boom, boom-boom-boom) break it down now
(Boom, boom-boom-boom) bring it up now
(Boom, boom-boom-boom) push it back girl
(Boom, boom-boom-boom)

[The Game]
Kels you crazy [repeats]


P-p-p-p Unit

You pussy ass nigga!

Who the snitch?
You the snitch
Who the bitch?
You the bitch [x4]

Look, get ya mask took off
When I blast four off
Pump the shotty
Throw your body
Where the grass grow tall
Jeah, I'm like tango for the cash
Orange Jag
Looking like a mango when it pass
With the tato on the mack
I ain't talking 'bout bagging up work when I put Yayo in the bag
Fuck is you rhyming about?
You 30, just getting in the game, you should be trying to get out
You it's drama when the llama get out
Pull and spit the lead
Bullets hit your head
Then your mind'll sit out
By the time they find this shit out
I'm in a different state
In a different zip, different whip, different plates
Wait! I put the heater to your head
You G Unit Ninja Turtles cause your leader is rat
Scrat!
It's simple as 1,2,3
You lames
Wanna get at Game
You gotta come through me

Tony Yayo
Get out the way ho
Lloyd Banks just got shot
Technique pass the mack
And aim it at Curtis Jack
You ain't right
Trying to be Frank White
You getting smacked
Little accident murderer
I just now heard of ya
And the next time you disrespect the west, E serving ya
Yayo
You better lay low
Cause the M.O.B. got some killers on the payroll
I put a million dollar hit on you snitches
Show you why we call ourselves Money Over Bitches

[Chorus]
I got a clip full of poison bananas
And some cold hard killers from Compton (here monkey, monkey)
I got a clip full of poison bananas
And a cold hard killer from Philly (here monkey, monkey)
I got a clip full of poison bananas
And a cold hard killer from Long Beach (here monkey, monkey)
I got a clip full of poison bananas
And a cold hard killer from L.A. (here monkey, monkey)

Olivia, get back in the car
'Fore I smack you like 50 did Fredo Starr
And he picking on lil niggas
Is it me or is it every video, Curtis Jackson get a lil bigger?
Nigga using that muscle enhancement
All I need is a couple dumbells and a sandwich
Fuck holding a conference
I'll run to Violator, hold Chris Lighty for hostage
Cause Banks doing gay porn, come out the closet!
Either that or I'mma knock Chris Lighty unconsciencious
Cut all the non-sense
You was PC'd up
Hit the bricks, rapping 'bout the corner like you Common
Talk of New York? You Jorge Pasada
I throw 'em, you catch 'em, that's not a threat, that's a promise
You did 6 months, now you a convict?
I accepted your phones calls now you got me on some wild shit
Judge said, "Time spent"
Now you can get it from the same gun homicide dropped five dimes with
And next time you try to kiss me on the cheek
You won't be alive long enough to put out my heat

[Chorus]

Welcome to the west, let me show you what hood like
My niggas down to sit on death row and ain't fucking with Suge Knight
Tag your left toes, wish you niggas a good night
Rock-a-by baby
Chrome .380
Screaming, "Ready to die"
Them niggas ain't crazy
On the black wall on the mini street that they can't be
A pine box plenty of leg room
Game, hit me, we're watching X's rented in Cancun
I'm look at the two like, "The nerve of this damn dude"
Pointing a beam at him, locating his next wound
Talk to my heat
Chi-Chi get the Yayo
Replace that G Unit bandana with a halo

[Chorus]


[Sheek Louch (The Game)]
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he gon' have to decide, who he fuckin with
(You know what it is motherfucker)
Who you fuckin with
Them niggaz don't care about you
Them niggaz don't give a fuck about you
Why you rappin like that? This street music!

Yo, let's, talk about it what
Sheek'll throw the fiend on a nigga guarantee he won't walk up out it
("DJ Ski!") With my nickel plated; kinda old
But the muzzle that I use'll make this motherfucker updated
Puh, nigga please; if a nigga had your son
and had him lookin down the gun you wouldn't need to squeeze
Uh uh I don't know, don't wanna hear
about the money that you had, or what you did a long time ago
Yo yo the hood is mine; I don't gotta sell a lot
I just live off more points than the porcupines
Fuh-fuh feel me cousin?
Sheek been a problem before this D-Block shit started buzzin
Some'll say no he wasn't, he turned sick
With that women in your family can suck my dick
And I been red hot e'ry since
I ain't sayin I'm the best muh'fucker, I'm just workin with {?}

[Chorus: Sheek Louch - repeat 2X]
This is that Blood, Crip, Latin King shit
Every hustler pushin a whip
(Street music) What? (Street music) What?
(Street music) What? (Street music)

[The Game]
Nigga let's (Nu Jersey) talk about it what
Banks say he bustin his gun, but I never seen a spark come out it
Now now who's the wanksta?
At Hot 97 you called police then called for peace
D-d-dear Mr. Interscope, I'll put you in a scope
Burst rounds, you the first down like a {?}
Eh eh nigga choke, now the talk of New York
is Yayo die with 50's dick in his throat
G-G-G-shit a joke; Olivia's a man
And hot damn there's a fuckin lump in his throat
Spit brrrap in my sight
If I don't catch you, I'ma catch James Cruz or Chris Lighty
Now that that that's for snitchin
You don't run through Queens, you call 911 or Supreme
I'll put you on to Game, pull a gun on your team
This for Compton, that's for Queens, cause

[Chorus]


[The Game]
Lets get back to some killa shittt [echoes]

[Chuck B. More]

[Chorus 2x]
Few times he been around this hood
If he ain't got a vest on, it ain't all good
and he ain't gon' swallow that slug
he ain't gon' swallow that slug

there's that clip, there's that (g-unit) crip [3X]

see my niggas in the hood hoppin out them lo-los
when they pull they gats out they ain't playing
so get your bitch-ass out the way or u gon get your crew laid down
when them hollow tips hit you, your chest start burnin
if you dont fall down my niggas keep sprayin
it won't stop till everybody dead, if not they circle around

[Chorus 2x]
Few times he been around this hood
If he ain't got a vest on, it ain't all good
and he aint gon' swallow that slug
he aint gon' swallow that slug

there's that clip, there's that (g-unit) Crip [3X]

hit yo switch on the '64, then pull the glock out
let the world know my clips extended

when the JVM shut it downn
when i hear them sirens
imma hit the switch slide off from seat ridin 3 wheel motion
(G-U N O T Another one bites the slug)

[Chorus 2x]
Few times he been around this hood
If he aint got a vest on, it aint all good
and he aint gon' swallow that slug
he aint gon' swallow that slug

There's that clip, there's that (g-unit) crip [3X]

and
Feed Them Bananas B-A-N-A-N-A-S [4X]


[Common]
Yeah yeah whattup doe this Common right here
Look, my nigga Game, you know how we rotate
Chicago, to Compton
Gangbangin the revolution boy, aight?
Yo it's love, my nigga Game, peace
(DJ Ski, is bringin it to the streets!)

[Dr. Dre]
Streets is talkin, sayin Dre done changed
And he ain't been to the hood, well how the fuck I find Game?
I studied this rap shit, still a "Hundred Miles and Runnin'"
Still makin Aftermath classics
You might catch me out in traffic
Oh-five Aston, bitches askin "Where I'm From"
Y'all forgot who helped 50 Cent pop
I ain't spent my own money since Eminem dropped
In eighty-fo' I had the streets locked
I am to gangsta rap what Biz Markie is to beatbox
Niggaz think cause I stopped on that "Detox"
I traded in my All Stars for some Freeboks
Speakers still bumpin, the beats still comin
Compton's version of Phil Drummond
Same Dre, "Different Strokes," same six-fo', different spokes
Same "Chronic" just different smoke

[Chorus: Nate Dogg (scratches)]
If you don't know ("Aftermath, nigga with a attitude")
("Game time niggaz, Westside!") Where I'm from
("Nigga with a attitude, Straight Outta Compton we rock khakis and Chucks")
If you don't know ("Almost lost my life when Dre dropped The Chronic")
("Legend in the making") Where I'm from
("Aftermath you bastards, watch your colors in this City of Angels")

[The Game]
Y'all niggaz got it fucked up, what you thought
cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?
Platinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus
Play both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz
See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Bloods
You can C-Walk to this homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin since Mary J. did "Real Love"
(If you don't know)
I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques
Niggaz lookin for a cat to jack
Homey I'm willin to do two life sentences back to back
So please don't push me
You niggaz is WNBA - all pussy

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Money Over Bitches!
Fuckin' wit the M.O.B

Yo God! You from New York

Niggaz hidin' out
thinkin' that the beef will settle
Whoever knew G-Unit made pink stilletos?
Ask Buck if I squeeze my metal
life is to short so I eat, sleep shit
and breathe the ghetto
The Los Angeles king
no hockey mask
Cause when you try your face
you get shot in tha ass!

[Hook]

This that sick rap, kick back
Come to where I pitch at
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way, with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs
Stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt, Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring, sold Peddi Crack
Game was on the block in his beanie with a mac
I'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of
A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb, Al-Qaeda
Listen, you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator
Silver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west
YG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep
Bently truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck
Pass the Goose, where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from do or die
Now do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patty
And I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickle sack baggies
That's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On
Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween
This ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch, I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state, I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
Party sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic and I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap, I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas, Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me, on or off TV
Gun by them Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5" Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
I'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's
I'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and corn row Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet

This ain't a diss, nigga
This is all lives matter except this nigga's

This 1992 shit ain't no new shit
We in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip
With guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship
Fuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips
My nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit
This the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit
Nigga you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit
And I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick
So tell your lil' vibrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip
We know where you live, nigga, you better move quick
And start thinking twice about who you hop in the coupe with


[Jeremih:]
All eyes on ya
Ask you how your week been
Workin' always, let me
Work you out for the weekend
Baby, I'm a beast, uh-huh
Can you tame me?
I'm gon' let it out
Let you down

[The Game:]
Let's get to it
Let me lick you in places you never been licked before
Take you to places you never been before
Like London, Paris, see that Lamborghini outside
We can share it, J and B without the marriage
Horse and carriage, seÃ±orita
Snapchat dog filters live from Ibiza
Breakfast on the beach, that mean sex is on the beach
You lookin' like a fruit platter, I'm a bite into your peach
And um, I think about to massage your feet
And um, you got a body, you remind of my Jeep
And um, I must look amazing with you
Cause every time you on my arm I got

[Jeremih:]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

[The Game:]
'Member when you used to curved me, leave my text message unread?
And every time I asked to see you, you say you goin' to bed
Every time I hit you with the good morning you say you workin'
Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner
Now that's my vagina, she told me to sshh
We in the Chanel store and

[Jeremih:]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you

Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play "Room Up In Here", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together

[The Game:]
You want me to say your name, huh?
Karrueche!

[Jeremih:]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it

You'se the one I fell in love with
The one I move these drugs with
But now you on some fuck shit

Leave me on the floor fucking bloody, God damn
Baby you, you had me fooled the whole time
Now you got me in King of Diamonds giving these hoes time
Girl, baby you

When you see the door, you see the door

[Jason Derulo:]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be thinking bout you on the long drive, yeah

[The Game:]
Tell me how you think we living how we live?
Like you the one that put us in these cribs
Not me but baby you
Like I ain't getting money for these shows
I guess you think I'm tripping on these hoes
They fans but look at you
Who in them Celine bags? Who in them Giuseppes?
Louboutins, wanna bet me? I win cause it's you
You begged me to get on that show
I ain't want it but you did
I'm a real nigga I did it for you
You don't see Swizz and Alicia
Kim K and Kanye arguing all the time
It's just you
I begged you to marry me
Half a million dollars out my safe down the drain
But fuck it cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it something we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singing shit about you

[Jason Derulo:]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past

Blood is money and I spent it on ya
Ain't it funny how it ended up in

[The Game:]
Oh, oh

[?]

Six in the morning, police at my door
Woulda seen them niggas coming but the cameras is broke
My nigga Ant in the kitchen cooking up for a week
And my lil homie Pooh on my mama couch sleep
We cooking base, we cooking base
We cooking base, we cooking base
50 grams on the table, a key in the couch tucked
And it's time to break it down cause everything getting flushed
Looking out the window tryna find a way out
Seen the SWAT team creeping on the side of the house
They threw a canister through the window, it shattered the glass
So I went into the closet and pulled out my gas mask

It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
And I die before I go back to jail, tell them niggas this is
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky

Nigga fuck the cops
They're supposed to have my house surrounded but it's not
So I'm hopping over the back gate with my Glock
Crossing Wilmington with 1500 in my sock
Look across the street, they running in and out my spot
Ant on the curb in cuffs
And Pooh don't know what's going on cause he just woke up
Till my Cincinnati fitted walked in and out the store
Ain't find no drugs or guns so they let my niggas go
We supreme, we mix that Sprite with that Promethazine
Hop in that Cutlass, hit the switch and flee the scene
Euro coming up the block looking like a monster
Chucking up P's when we riding through

Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton

Riding down Alameda, everything was straight
Until we stopped at a light, and ran into the grapes
My heart beating like a 15 inch with bass
Cause I reached for my strap and it wasn't on my waist
I'm a fool
What kind of nigga go to work without his tools?
And you often watch wearing red like it's bool
It's usually on sight with the crips
My guns stuck between the seats and them niggas ain't trip
Bust a left on Imperial, sliding on gold rims
Empty the guts out the swisher then hop on the 110
Look around, I don't see one black and white
So we rolled the windows up and hotboxed at the light, yeah

It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
Watch Kobe score 60 on the Jazz, now we heading back to
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
Bompton, Bompton, Bompton, Bompton
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha-ha-ha


You see these white people vote for Trump but they don't give a fuck about OJ
I watch the nigga whole TV show and still don't give a fuck about OJ
And don't go out like OJ
Beat a murder, went to jail for some football cards, I can't go out like OJ

White Bronco through the city like El Chapo
I get my dick sucked as I pulled up in Del Taco
It's the coach, you the presence of the ghost
Nigga say he can outrap me? I DOC his throat, fuck him
Guns, I tuck 'em, bitches I bust 'em
My niggas kidnap kids like Ciara and Russell, uh
That ain't no future for me, now come and touch mine
Your whole family tree'll get flatlined
Face off, twin Desert Eagles crack spines
I ain't joking so keep playing on the batline
This ain't Gotham, this is Compton nigga
We mix Red Bulls with vodka nigga
We blow chronic and sleep with monsters nigga
Try to be conscious, get left unconscious nigga
And we got rocket launchers nigga
Ain't never been to Iraq, the government sponsor niggas

You see these white people vote for Trump but they don't give a fuck about OJ
I watch the nigga whole TV show and still don't give a fuck about OJ
And don't go out like OJ
Beat a murder, went to jail for some football cards, I can't go out like OJ


Oh-oh-oh-oh

Ayo it's time for the function
Time to bring dinner to all of these nigga luncheon
This for 2Pac, Heron, Bountry
Halloween mask, carve one of you pumpkins
Empty the pills out, fire up the purp now
Game is back, lil niggas pull your skirt down
Flow ice cold, Max Julian on a ho
Used to run the rock, Jim Brown in the snow
Moncler bomber, armor Under Armour
.38 special cause I believe in karma
Double entendre holding your Aunt Sandra
Then we can talk the location I left your mama
Lost on the ganja, letting my mind wander
Made for the drama like a fucking mixtape
Use a Phantom in a drive-by nigga and switch plates
Getting the bigger pool the only way to diss Drake
And I'm coming

However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?
However do you want me? However do you need me?

Don't compare me to shit I ain't none of you niggas
I'll smoke your lil mafia in front of you nigga
Left Aftermath cause I wanted to nigga
Still pull up on Dre and smoke a blunt or two, nigga it's lit
Came in the game like a red nose pit
You got business in LA? I dead your shit
Shut video shoots down, turn airplanes around
Knowledge in belly anonymous rounds
Tryna host AOD and niggas lying you down
Of course the wolves can smell when vagina in town
Turn these niggas inside out like Killa Cam back
Intercepted at the airport, nigga the Rams back
Flying Spur, top missing like Ginobili
Grill all gold, that's my motherfucking whoadie
Love when niggas act like they don't know me
Still I start shooting, remind 'em of the old Kobe
Slife

However do you want me? However do you need me?
(Whenever you want it, however you want it)

However do you want me? However do you need me?

Nigga, I'm my own Suge, report to nobody
Give these niggas awards and they still nobodies
I don't go to the Grammies, nigga I bag those
Fuck the BET awards, I done had those
Fuck a freestyle, nigga this a cash flow
Young Jay and I ain't never had a Jaz-0
Ask Kanye "who the real asshole?"
Cuban links smoking a Cuban, Fidel Castro
Feet up at Mastero's, table full of models
I'ma fuck 'em all, right hand on the bible
Head game crazy, mommy suicidal
Rubbing on my dick while she download Tidal
This the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
A product of gin and juice inside of my baby bottle
Said this the life of Pablo mixed with Mercielagos
No more parties in LA or Chicago

However do you want me? However do you need me?

[Raekwon:]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rocking the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I be gettin' the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
(Bongo by the way, red Wallabies)

Buzzing with my Killa Beez
Chronic had my eyes chinky like Compton was the Philippines
Junior prom, red suit, Tasha in that limousine
Tryna suck the head off my dick like a guillotine
Came in her mouth, then gave her some Listerine
Put a condom on and let her grind it like a centipede
(Cash rules everything around me)
Before Dre found me
Before my city crowned me
Bummie lil nigga, pussy niggas used to clown me
Had to wear my brother's clothes, them shits used to drown me
6 years passed now I'm banging in the county
Niggas that used to talk shit won't even come around me
Reciting Method Man while my cellie just sit there
Niggas know I been on the Wu before Ric Flair
Came home through the hood, GX shining
Now these bitches think I'm Lex Diamonds

Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)

I grew up on Wu-Tang
Dope had my shoe game Liu Kang
Jordan 12's sick as hell, Michael Jordan flu game
Glass jar, Pyrex, obsessed with the blue flame
Lexus coupe, rubbing on them titties boy, 2 Chainz
Top of the food chain, niggas wanna kill me
Cause I turned into the plug, I'm where the chronic and the pills be
RZA with the rings, Old Dirty with the stainless
5 .38 revolvers, 36 chambers
Killah like Ghostface
As the Rollie rotate
Daytons on the S-Class equipped with the floor safe
And we had the stash spots with them red and blue tops
Chronic in the gladlock
The dope spot padlocked
In the living room bagging shit up watching Matt Lock
Black Glock, crack rock bundled in my black socks
And my mama working late
Skinny nigga serving weight
Let the chronic circulate the purple tape

I grew up on Wu-Tang
Nigga I grew up on Wu-Tang
(Cash rules everything around me)
(Cash rules everything around me)
(C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dollar, dollar bill y'all)


Can you pan over a little bit? Look at this right here, this is a suburban type jeep with a sharp shooter peering outside of the sunroof with an automatic rifle. It appears to be a scene you might see in Operation Desert Storm and we've been seeing this all night

It's a trap, it's a trap
Why they ain't tell us red and blue don't matter when you black
Matter of fact we in blindfolds
Bunch of lost souls
Kids shot dead in the streets now they eyes closed
How you call the angels when it's kings getting beat up
And Gil Garcetti in his office with his feet up
No way to dodge police brutality
Selling crack cocaine, making a teacher's salary
Mexicans hopping the borders in the thousands
Become cholos, one button pendleton and they styling
Crips on the corner in Dodger blue with they gold chains
Bloods sporting corn rows and Chucks with the red strings
Sun going down so them Chevys about to roll out
Fiends scratching themselves, stumbling out the dope house
Niggas tying bandanas, bout to put the drum on
Make it home 'fore street lights come on

The way we living savage
The way we living savage
The way we living savage
The way we living savage

So grab that gun, load that clip
Grab that torch, light that shit
Grab that stick, grab that brick
Throw it
It's time to riot if you don't see black owned in the window
It's on fire
Start here, end up over there
The smell of gun powder in the air
And just so we clear
This is pain and despair
We burn our own shit and we aware
And don't care
Tell the national guards to disappear
We got guns too and we ain't scared
So fuck the man, fuck the President Bush and his legislation
Shit gotta change and we ain't waiting, fuck patience
The government corrupt, I can prove it
Martin, Malcolm, Huey P. Newton
And that's why the whole city out here looting
How can we stand here and not do shit?
All this smoke over the hood looking like low clouds
Cars with no miles on fire, they broke down
White people wishing that they was at home
Asians fronting like they business is black owned
Far from stupid, we coming in the stores tripping
Running in swap meets for they Jordans and they Pippins
Crowbars, bats, anything that break glass
They fucked Rodney King up and now it's they ass
So it's bottle rockets through the window
Kids that would never smoke indo
Fiends kicking in doors, steeling Nintendos
Niggas robbing liquor stores with taped up duck hunt guns
City burning but it's fucked up fun
National guards on the corner
They don't know the hood, they foreigners
We was busting at the cops before Chris Dorner
Ghetto birds flying over the hood, they see us
Showing the fuck out, cleaning the trucks out
Niggas mobbing down the streets pushing big screens and baskets
Staring straight into the cameras
No ski mask, just pandemonium
Niggas looting what they homies in
Running around with Scarface guns like they was Tony and them
Who, what, where, when, how the fuck they gonna stop us?
When the last 50 years we accustomed to window shopping
So we taking lighters to the tip of magazines
Dip 'em in gasoline

And set this motherfucker on (fire)
The whole world watching, Los Angeles is on (fire)
Yeah, yeah, (fire)
1992, was you here for the (fire)
Uh-huh

Standing on the corner with a brick in my hand
When my mother told me sit in the van, nah fuck that
Footlocker chained up, wire cutters cut that
Niggas crip walking where Reginald Denny's truck at
Police cars, driving by niggas in slow mo
If you white don't stop at the light, cause that's a no-no
Running through the malls, give us everything polo
The first time niggas ain't have beef with the cholos
'92 fire lit the skyline
And why loot? To capture that forbidden troop
Cause Adam never ate the fruit
Fuck your blue suits, your badge, and them high beams
We out here selling chronic, we ain't have no Jimmy Iovines
Shit burning, you gon' need more than Visine
We making a movie better than anyone that I've seen
Should be on ShowTime, HBO, Cinemax

Get a match, we gon' make sure that y'all remember that (fire)
The whole world watching, Los Angeles is on (fire)
Yeah, yeah, (fire)
1992, was you here for the (fire)
Uh-huh

Make me wanna holla
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holla
The way they do my life
This ain't living, this ain't living
No-no baby, this ain't living
No, no, no, no
Inflation, no chance
To increase


You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the

It been 10 years since you heard from niggas on the west side
Now we on the cover of the Vibe
A nigga shot me five times
I'm happy to be alive
And my mama told me
(You got the juice now baby)
My first album went 5 times plat
Looking for California, it was on my back
I was 23 when I had my first kid
And his mama told him when he came out
(You got the juice)
Like father, like son, uh
Top down, Mercedes throttle
Wrist looking like a nigga just played the lotto
I am to Compton what Ye is to Pablo
Run up on the car, just spray with hollows
I grew up in the six-trey Impala
Ain't make the league but I made the dollars
Recording my demo, knew Dre will follow
Remember Eve told me

You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby

Left the Unit and the world went cray
I blame it on the California mind state
Too much weed, weather, women, chronic seeds, ass, titties
Can a nigga pour his Henny
Without niggas acting fake in his motherfucking face one time
'Fore I pull the .40 up out the waist line
I'm the first Compton nigga Dr. Dre signed
And Mary J told me at baseline
(You got the juice now baby)
Then my second album went plat too
And it was thug life with this Eazy tattoo
But I never forgot where I came from
Or where I got my name from
My grandma told me
(You got the juice now baby)
And here's something I can't forget
My mama brought a nigga up on that LA gangster shit
Your boy ain't never gonna change mama
Here's some change mama and a Range mama
She looked back and said

You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the juice now baby, you got the juice
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby
You got the, you got the, you got the juice now baby

So much pressure applied
All this pressure applied
Pray, this pressure applied to our lives
Feels like we gon' bust, feels like we gon' bust
Over gestures you die
Ain't no question that I'm tryna make it out alive
But sometimes
Feels like I'm gon' bust, feels like I'm gon' bust
Feels like I'm gon' bust, yeah, feels like I'm gon' bust, oh
So much pressure applied
All this pressure, I'm fly
Greatest pressure, applied to our lives
We gon' bust, gon' bust


Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic

Maybe I should move a little
Smoke a little
Fuck around, get high a little
Start reminiscing about the old times
12 years old, cars driving by with gangsters in it
You ain't stand too long cause you already knew it was gangsters in it, nigga
Yeah when everything was copacetic
Till niggas got off them 40 ounces, that's when even the pope can get it
Chronic smoke all in the air, ain't nobody playing fair
And Snoop Dogg had all these niggas around here tryna braid they hair
Red and blue, khaki suits
Us lil niggas got active too
From Lincoln Park, back to the fruits
Us lil niggas had ratchets too
So what you saying nigga?
We ain't playing nigga
We kill your daddy and let your mama do all that praying nigga
Lose your fucking life when them

Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic

My mama was a gangster nigga
My daddy was just a gangster nigga
Wasn't for them I wouldn't be from Compton
I should probably thank them niggas
Taught me how to shoot, rob, kill, how to shank a nigga
Maybe I should blame them for all these cases where I done banked a nigga
AKs out of M3's
Prostitutes on bent knees
Gun shots on Greenleaf
All these 64s, no Bentleys nigga
Euros on Cutlasses, you can't rent these niggas
Bout to do a drive-by tonight, that's why we tint these nigga
Heard shots rang out, just riding on my 10 speed
Seen the windows down and the bitch squeezed
Nigga almost died tryna get some weed
So don't be fooled by the palm trees
This Compton nigga, that 310
That 213, we on Death Row
Ain't no one escape unless you DRE
And that's how I felt when

Cars drive by in the night
So much sound coming from inside
Red, blue flags hanging from the side
So much time went passing by
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic
The soundtrack to the ghetto was The Chronic


[Part 1 - True Colors]

This ain't nothin' nigga. All this gang bangin' shit? It ain't nothin' homie, it ain't nothin'. I'd give it up, I'm in this shit for a purpose man. I got a reason dude to get up out of this shit nigga. All that shit ain't nothin' homie. Ask yourself what color is the flag? (Red, white, and blue). Yup, red, white, and blue. Now what two colors did we pick? I'm talkin' bout we as black people, what two colors? Think about it, we picked red and blue, what's left? White. Damn right nigga we killin' each other homie

[Sample - Ice T:]
I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or blue, cuz or blood, it just don't matter

My daddy was from Nutty Blocc
My uncle was from Nutty Blocc
My mama was from Hoover, how she end up here cuttin' rock?
Four year old on her lap, that was my older sister
Photos of Tookie and my father, now you get the picture
Cutlass outside on D's, you think it wasn't
15 inches, had Computer Love, subbin'
My parents bout to see Rocky at the Compton Drive In
Halfway through the movie her stomach start throbbin'
My pops start panicin', moms in the passenger seat
Scared of contractions so she's stiff as a mannequin
Pops put the car in reverse and then skrt'd out
"Drive motherfucker" them the words my mom skrt'd out
80 down Wilmington, pull up at Killer King
Rush my mama to her room and let the doctor do his thing
Was a whole lotta blood, yeah I was born in it
Gang banging my family got torn in it, all over

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

Jordan got drafted to the Bulls, '85 here
My Uncle Greg sniffin' cocaine off my high chair
Mama in the kitchen cookin', pops on the couch baggin'
Cousin's loadin' Louie Vuitton duffles in the Station Wagon
Fiends walkin' in and out my house in old Nikes
Pops used to tell me "son don't you ever be like me"
The bloods want to kill me, the cops'll never catch me
And when you gang bangin' life's shorter than Joe Pesci
Then one night my pops came home off heroin
Shit changed, I'm glad my mama didn't marry him
Molested my sister that night cause she was scared
I was too young to help her and my brothers wasn't there
It was late night, 2AM, my mother at work
My sister came back up the stairs and it was blood on her shirt
Blood on her face, blood on her hands, blood on her legs
Turned on the light and everything was red
I'm surrounded by

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

Seven years passed, now a lil nigga seeing things
Playin' with the birds like Magic, we was the dream team
Posted up on the block, I had that Hakeem lean
Watchin' '64s hop my nigga, no green screen
Walkin' from the Tanas to the Cedars with my eyes closed
Red bandanna in my pocket, how you hide those?
Larry Nickles crack spot, my brother got me servin'
Couldn't cook, burnin' holes in my Dennis Rodman jersey
Then a nigga turned Pippen on these niggas
40 sippin' on these niggas
If you Crippin', we was trippin' on you nigga
But the Crips would never lay down
They thought that it was they town
We thought it was ours so we would empty out the trey pounds
Ditched school especially since it was an all Crip school
I'm lucky I'm alive, but would you be if bullets hit you?
26 dead homies and 2 dead brothers
Compton is a cold motherfucker
Niggas dyin' over

Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
Colors, colors, colors, colors, colors
My colors, colors, colors, colors, colors

[Part 2 - It's On]

If someone took the flag out my pocket
Wrap it around my knuckles, make a fist and lock it
If someone took the flag out my pocket
Wrap it around my knuckles, make a fist and lock it
If someone took the flag out my pocket
Wrap it around my knuckles, make a fist and lock it
If someone took the flag out my pocket
Wrap it around my knuckles, make a fist and lock it

[Osbe Chill:]
These rappers gimmicks, fuck an image
Straight out of Baldwin Village
If it's any real activity I'm in it in the midst of the fiction
Still had a vision, look I never gave up
Game put me on this song and I fucked around and came up
I'm Jungles, most my niggas gone so I'ma do it for them
Antman, Nightmare, B.S.I.P., Tiny M
It's struggle first, blessin' last
Like I've been hittin' licks all my life and I passed
Kept it active for my son he know his daddy ain't a bitch
Been bangin' all my life now I'm just tryna get rich
This shit is drastic, my flow bashin'
On rappers I'm flowin' after
The cabbage is all that matters
I'm laughin', these niggas cowards
It's Osbe, gang bangin' is my hobby
Except my model cars it's a fuckin' dead body
I'm from the jungle, all the homies call me Barzan
Loadin' up the clips and hoppin' out them stolen cars and

If someone took the flag out my pocket


Thank Dr. Dre for giving me a chance
Thank that big booty bitch Maliah for that freaky dance
She gave me last night
Jump in a 'Rari
Pull up to her crib and hit that pussy like a crack pipe
I listen to Dipset, want Cam and Jim to squash it
But how can I say that when I ain't made up with Fif yet?
I'm watching Power while I benchpress
Four plates on each side, maxed out, 6 reps
On my Drizzy Drake, yeah 6 reps
Rollie with the grizzly face
Mike Conley, is he straight?
Damn right he is
I got platinum and I violate niggas like Chris Lighty did
I make music for all my niggas locked up state
With Blac Chyna on they walls and now they seen a fuck face
Quarter million on the dresser, nigga what safe?
Trigger my alarm and you gon' run into some duct tape

I'm still here, they said I wasn't welcome
Came into the game and then everybody felt him
What your life like?
Mine's bout getting money and bitches
64's and swishers, popping guns with my niggas
What your life like?
Mines bout listening to Illmatic
In my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average
What your life like?
Mines bout shedding tears when Pac died
Swimming in money like the Rothschilds
Nigga what your life like?
Nigga what your life like?
Tell me what your life like

I done have conversations with Timbo
Passed on a couple Pharrell and Swizz instrumentals
I done wore a two piece tux on Jimmy Kimmel
Then came to the hood and whopped your ass like I was Kimbo
I done lost 20 million on lawyer fees
But I'ma get it back when I sue Jimmy for my royalties
I done had Scott Storch recording me
Drove through Compton with the doors up, ain't no ignorning me
I done took shots at Jay, I done took shots of 'gnac
I done took shots for Cedar, five couldn't drop me flat
RIP to Frog, RIP to Will
He was just as Ill as Will so I know how Nas feel
Nigga I'm the greatest
300 bars was like 15 minutes long, tell me how many times you played it
How many times you had your Documentary stolen and replaced it?
That's that 5 million out the gate shit

I'm still here, they said I wasn't welcome
Came into the game and then everybody felt him
What your life like?
Mine's bout getting money and bitches
64's and swishers, popping guns with my niggas
What your life like?
Mines bout listening to Illmatic
In my grandmother's attic tryna spit above average
What your life like?
Mines bout shedding tears when Pac died
Swimming in money like the Rothschilds
Nigga what your life like?
Nigga what your life like?
Tell me what your life like
Tell me what your life like


Ray Ray - So what's up Lil J?
Lil J - We down Ray Ray
Ray Ray - So what set you claiming?
Lil J - Claiming Hoover and South Shores, we down with 32's in most quads, straight like that
Ray Ray - Straight like that huh?

We grew up as friends
We was 10, lil niggas on the block
He ain't have his own basketball so we shared my rock
His mama was a fiend, he ain't heard from his pops
He used to share my clothes with him all the way down to his socks
He would spend a night, that one night would turn into a week
At least until his mama got back on her feet
And she never did
So he moved in with me, my mama, and my sisters
Couldn't let him go to foster care cause she ain't trust the system
So she took care of him like he was me
Gave us everything she could back when shit was all good

Just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas
We was just some young niggas

Niggas turned 12 in '92, we was headed to the 7th grade
Running 'round, stealing cars, dreaming about the better days
Ducking strays, catching fades tryna make it through this maze
Teachers out here smoking J's and wonder why we misbehave
Same book, different page
Another year, different age
Cross colors, colors cross, bows turning into fades
He started cripping, I started blooding
Now we walking through the halls of school like we don't even know each other

Young nigga out in these streets
(Out in these streets)
We was just some young niggas
(All in these streets to feed)
Young niggas
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
(Young niggas in the streets)

Started off as brothers but sometimes shit falls apart
How can I hate this nigga with all this love up in my heart
With this nigga mean mugging
Every time we in the class
Nigga tuck that blue rag or I'm beat your fucking ass
Guess my mind gone
Caught him after school, he ain't had no ride home
Still got that rag hanging, that's what got him fired on
He pulled the strap so I pistol whipped him with the chrome
Wasn't tryna kill him, coulda pulled the trigger
I was just a young nigga

Young nigga out in these streets
(Out in these streets)
Just a young nigga
(All in these streets to feed)
Just a young nigga
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
I was just a young nigga
(Young niggas in the streets)

Whopped my nigga ass, he ain't take it on the chin
Rumor started to spread, guess I saw him when I see him
Two weeks pass and graduation came around
I was walking through the choir, .45 under my gown
Had to take a leak, so I headed to the bathroom
Corner of my eye, see him coming out of the class room
We exchange words so I cocked the 45th
He shot, I shot back, thank God I ain't get hit
But damn I miss my young nigga

(Out in these streets)
Just a young nigga
(All in these streets to feed)
Just a young nigga
(Lord knows I don't want no enemies yeah)
(Young niggas in the streets)

Young niggas, young niggas, young niggas
I ain't the one nigga
Down with my young niggas


[Intro]
That T.M. shit, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit â Game!

[Chorus: unknown singer (The Game)]
I don't care that you lookin like Beyonce on her best day
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
You got your high heels on and your body feel warm but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
You got your hair did right and your panties too tight but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)
Could be another night, girl, but tonight
(I ain't fuckin wit'chu)

[The Game]
I'm tired of playin your games, you pissin me off
I'm watchin LeBron so holla when this shit go off
You say I be trippin but really it's you that be gone
Always bringin up Tanisha be givin me dome
I ain't tryin to hear that, I'm just tryin to chill
So chill, like Chamillionaire or Mike Jones grill
All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans
Dancin like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50
Tryin to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out
Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse
We used to hit midtown, throwin all them stacks out
Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out
Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out
You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin to act out
Flippin like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house
Black out

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Bitch, I'm rollin 21's and over
Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover
My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet
And that line was fly, bitch I'm a Leer jet

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Stop playin girl, stop playin
Stop playin girl, stop playin!
Stop playin girl, stop playin
I said stop playin, you better stop playin
'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that
Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back
Cause that's what we do, when girls be with the chit-chat
Every mornin on "The View", them girls be with the chit-chat
Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk
I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk
But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off
Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought
For real

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That T.M. shit, uh-huh, that T.M. shit
Trackmasters, that T.M. shit, that shit
That T.M. shit â Game!


[Common]
I spent my day so, first I pray yo 
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods
Thinking whats good, things that I can't change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to like, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right, to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam, man, bike pedaling
To the nature spot, to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, an angel

[Chorus]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

[The Game]
Th-th-the way that I rhyme, blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I start hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance, and she took Big down
I should've knew it, Shock G and Pac told me "She get around", an angel

[Chorus]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

[The Game]
Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin, "Didilly whoooa!"
I got love for the streets, peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots, I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (Angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car, and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but got it wrong
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

[Chorus]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings because I'm riding with my (Angel)
Going through the city of the Chi make me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)
Oooh I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)

[Common]
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene, L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme 
Yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy, we do it forever, yeah


[The Game]
Cool & Dre
Back on the motherfuckin Westside
L.A.X. niggaz, yeah
Y'all know who the fuck I am

I'm free as a motherfuckin bird I swear
Disappear in thin air, there go Game, nigga where?
Posted on the block, in them black Airs
In that all-black Phantom, hug the block like a bandit
There, that V-12 is roarin
Flyin through the city with the pedal to the floor then
I put them 26, inches on the curb
Tell the hood I'm back, give me a corner let me serve
Swerve, I'm still dope, that's my word
All I did was switch the kitchens and subtract all the birds
Irv... Gotti know I'm a +Murderer+
Half these niggaz beefin with me, I never heard of them
If I was the old me, I would murder them
Matter fact, if I was the old me, I would CURTIS them
Courtesy of my Smith & Wesson
I kill tracks like AIDS nigga, get infected

[Chorus: The Game]
The whole world been waitin on him
Here I come, droptop Phantom I'm skatin on 'em
Look around, all the bitch niggaz hatin on him
Mad cause I'm Chronic 2008'n on 'em
Big cars, big wheels, big chains (YEAHHH)
Big money, big pimpin, big dreams
Dreams (dreams) big dreams
Dreams (dreams) big dreams, dreams

[The Game]
I "Get Money" like Junior M.A.F.I.A. used to
On my way to school, ten thousand in my FUBU
Lunchtime I was sellin
Behind the bungalows, baggin up rocks the size of melons
That's when the fiends start tellin
You can catch 'em on the couch, everyday at 4 o'clock like Ellen
Primetime nigga, is my time nigga
Jacob ain't got shit to do with my shine nigga
Cause when the sun come up
From behind the sea, niggaz see me behind the B
ENT, don't stand for entertainment
It stand for zero to 60, anybody see where Game went?
To the hood, parked crooked behind that chain fence
And I'm goin down behind my dogs but I ain't Vick
Tell me one album I put out that ain't sick
No I'm not the Dr. but I produce the same shit

[Chorus]

[Extended Chorus]
Big cars, big wheels, big chains (YEAHHH)
Big money, big pimpin, big dreams
Dreams (dreams) big dreams
Dreams (dreams) big dreams, dreams

[The Game]
The Chronic, Makaveli to Doggystyle
Bad influences, so my momma told me to turn 'em down
She went to sleep so my father said I could turn it up
What did he care, he in the bathroom sherm'n up
So I let that Dogg Pound rock
Let that Ice Cube knock, 'til my sister pressed stop
Soon as she left out, like Diddy, I pressed play
That's when that Hard Knock Life, introduced me to Just Blaze
I would sit in my room, and just blaze
Before chronic had all these funny names, it was just haze
No hash, cause it was just haze
And I would get so high, nigga that I would just gaze
I mean I was so amazed somethin so fuckin green
could turn this little-ass house into a maze
Chronic 2001, got me through my hardest days
And just think, my momma said marijuana was a phase

[Chorus]

[The Game]
You was wrong momma
Shit I love you but I'm still smokin
I love you momma~!
Chronic 2001 to infinity MOTHERFUCKER, haha
Dr. Dre started it
I just finished it! I mean, a-hem
Picked up where the big homey left off, FEEL ME?
Ahahah


[Intro: Raekwon]
Sit in the chair, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, yeah
Sit my alligator jacket on the flo'
Let that shit crawl around, whattup Game?
How are you my nigga?
Let's get this money, you heard?

[The Game (Raekwon)]
Money in zip duffle bags, shotgun shells
My killas gorillas, niggaz couldn't see 'em with gazelles
Frontin ass niggaz, go hang with Pharrell
Tryin to be a (Cowboy), you catch bullets like Terrell
Owens, call it T.O., he leakin like a project sink
Busted open like a hot dog link
Bing, it gave me time to think yeah, I did my fuckin prison thing
Came out still on point, like the RZA rings
I'm from Compton but my inkpen live in Queens
Rep the dub like Wu-Tang, and I got (Killa Bees) (respect)
Black Wall Mafia, new millennium Genevieves
Got a million dollars say LeBron don't win a ring (word?)
I know Kobe, I be on the floor, "Kobe!"
You know a nigga that can score 81? Show me
I got a (Cuban Link) to a fuckin O.G.
And nigga you're too close, what the fuck, tryna blow me? (back up)

I'ma keep it (Compton) Staten ('til the day is done)

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Geah, frontin on us nigga, it's like
It's like racin a nigga in Afghanistan to go get some oil nigga
You gon' fuck around and get your head burnt

[Raekwon]
I'm a New York dinosaur, Staten Island artifact
Hip-Hop's never dead, the (Cuban) gave 'em heart attacks
Sleep in the woods, target cats come from under the V's
Sneeze wrong, course I'm clappin
Keep it movin homeboy, the mac's always actin
Spit in your face, go 'head lil' baby rappers
Can't fuck with us convicts, Stat-land
It's like actions, cliques'll die right with traction
It's Wall Street money and two gunny's
Slammers is extra chunky, yeah, me and my red monkeys
Silverback sales are few donkeys, all of us live comfy
Blow your head off like lunch meat
Chef in the game run the country
Take over the world little girl, better stay out our brunch meetin
Fuck with they paper their gun squeezin
Off top, leak from the cop, them nigga jumped, this is front season

[Interlude: Raekwon]
Yo, man yo Game man
Let these niggaz know man f'real man
We official man
They wan' be readin our autobiographies in a minute, ya heard?

[The Game (Raekwon)]
(Yo what if I was from Compton?) What if I was from Staten?
I'd be King Kong knockin down the buildings in Manhattan
(Gorilla warfare) Shootouts, real block shit
West coast assassin on some real 2Pac shit
My style's smokin like, after a glock spit
Game get the blood money, fuck bitches and pop Cris'
Style like it's New Year's, cause this a new year
Look at the tracks, either Bigfoot or The Game been through here
The Benjamins won't stop, and neither would a chrome glock
I kill a fire-breathin dragon with a dome shot
Come through your hood in a Chevy Malibu, on stocks
We had a meetin before we got here, and shit gon' pop
Heads gon' roll, Patron gon' spill
Fitted caps gettin peeled like the chrome on the wheels
Got a half a mil', sing your wounds won't heal
I declare war, nigga who gon' deal?

[Outro: Raekwon]
Yeah, y'all know what time it is man
"Bulletproof Diary" nigga, for real
Many may read this man
A lot of niggaz might not make it home, you heard?
We speak for the real ones man, for the churchmen man
All them real general niggaz man
All them niggaz that's out there man
Don't get no rest or none of that man, for real
The Chef nigga, Game whattup baby?

Get a lot of bread man, word up, hun'ned my nigga

Couple of mean Guatemalians wit us
Half Guatemala, half Somalian nigga
Niggaz ain't seen them colors man [fades out]


[Chorus]
California sunshine, in the summer time [4x]

Last year, Jazze Phe got stuck up inside the grand lux,
Most recent was 50 in Angola, thatâs whatâs up,
Any rapper could touched, any bitch could get fucked,
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks,
They say Suge got knocked out, but donât play that nigga cheap,
Cuz youâre body might wash up by the courts at Venice Beach,
Ainât shit sweet but my Swisher, ainât shit buzzin but my liquor,
Cali chickens got to the 80âs strip and come back a little thicker,
With more ass then Delicious, thatâs my Flavor of Love,
We make it rain like Rainman, when he play with the glove,
Iâm the king to you pawn niggas, punisher, spawn, niggas,
Playin in green, Paul Pierce to you Lebron niggas,
We them barbeque, front and back lawn niggas,
Summer Jam, throw your ass offstage Akon niggas,
We drink Kool Aid with the ice on your arm nigga,
Take that Champion hoody off in the California sunshine

[Chorus]

Iâm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire boulevard,
We canât find Biggiesâ killers so we gave Diddy a star,
And Iâm by far, Hollywood boulevard,
but Iâm from a boulevard that tought yaâll to shoot out of moving cars,
Remember, New Jersey driverâs like a East Coast menace,
And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dogg in it,
Give me a New York minute,
to show you Cali got more dead bodies then the Yankees got New York pennants,
Cuz we Dodgers and Impalas with the windows tinted,
I duck shots where Venus and Sarena used to play tennis,
And they never came back, like throwin a boomerang flat,
See me, Iâm posted like a Cincinatti pitcher in the same hat,
Itâs like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black,
Niggas roll up on you, Now you stuck in that Harold and Cane trap,
If you slippin in Hollywood, and you get your chain snatched,
I know some niggas that know some niggas, Ill get your chain back.

[Chorus]

Niggas already know who had the marijuana first,
We birthed haze and sour diesel, I was there when the water burst,
Hell nah we donât surf, We half way go to church,
Tell you the truth, shiit, right now Iâm in the fuckin hearse,
And it ainât my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse,
Itâll be another ten years before you see an MC Ren here,
Where he been, I been there, that Lambo, Iâm in there,
Hotter then the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there,
Top off the Murcialago like Victoriaâs Secret swim swear,
So listen, Iâm so sincere, bout to work out like gym wear,
Murder MTVâs top ten, and tat my face with 10 tears,
Thatâs 10 funerals, 10 caskets,
10 3-piece Ralph Lauren suits, 10 motorbikes stopping traffic,
And 10 reasons why I got California hotter than acid,
Donât you ever, ever leave me out of the top 10 you fuckinâ bastards
Blaow.

[Chorus]


[Ne-Yo]
Mmmmm, ohh-whoa-ohhhhh
Hey!

[The Game]
Picture me and my gangsta girl, ridin with the top back
Bangin Ne-Yo, my neck frio, my Sox hat
Tilted to the side, like you know I get my grind on
Get my shine on, jewelry blacken on rhinestones
Rims spinnin like a globe on these low pros
Do it big cause I'm s'posed to floss and that's the reason she break me off
Cause I'm gangsta, and I'm ridin with

[Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yooooo, it's a thug and a gentleman
Rollin like a boss do, no matter the cost to
Not tryin to brag but, money not a issue
Don't let your girl see us, that might make her diss you
Cause if she roll with us, she won't even miss you

[The Game]
Uh, uh, uh
Pop rubber bands when I throw a stack
before it hit the ground she throw it back
When I make it rain that's chump change that paid for the 26 on my Range
Range, Range, drive, drive, take the wheel when I roll this lye
Climb over to the passenger side and freeze

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
And once again it's on
If she take a picture with a camera phone
Then playa she not comin home
And if I'm on her screen saver, that might mean later we gone
If I let her take a picture, she will roll with me
If I let her take a picture, she will roll with me
If I let her take a picture, she will roll with me
And will roll with me, and will roll with me, ohh

[The Game]
If you don't know by now baby I'm a star, look at my face, look at my car
Look at my waist and look at my scars, look out the window see where we are
In my Phantom, in my Rover bangin

[Ne-Yo]
Ne-Yooooo, it's a thug and a gentleman (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She never rolled in a car with the suicide
Girl when they see you and I, they committin suicide
All of 'em want my girl - cause she pretty and thick in the thighs
Homie don't mess with mine - do us or it's suicide

[The Game]
She call me Jay, I call her B, we gettin married, to the streets
I'm chasin money she chasin me, I'm right where, I wanna be
With the B, on my Bentley, the horse on my Lambo
Crown on my Cadillac, checks on my Air Max
Haters, better fall back, 'fore I put somethin in your ballcap
That's my chick, I got her back like a bra strap
Cause she fine, and she cute, she think she all that
And she all that, that's my girl, that's my world

[Chorus]

[unknown female - repeat 2X]
Game, can you take a picture?
Ne-Yo, can you take a picture?
We been waitin all night
Just to take a picture wit'cha

[The Game]
Grab the wheel, take control, and let your hair blow inside my Lambo
Pull out your phone, picture that
take you home let your man know I'm hittin that
While I'm hittin that, she send it back, she drop it low, we about to blow
Me and N-E, dash, Y-O, yo', girl know
She's so Ciara, so Eve, so Mariah, so B
She's so Trina, I'm R. Kelly; she remind me of, my gold D's
I'm Coolie Hi, I'm Cocheese, she a 34-D, I'm so pleased
I'm So So Def, she's so Janet, I'm J.D. and she fo' me
In a H-2, we fo' deep, through the N.Y.C. off no sleep
I hate to drive but I break it wide when I'm ridin with my show D
I kidnap her never take her home, ridin off bangin Ne-Yo sittin on chrome
In that Maserati see the paparazzi they [cameras clicking] she gone

[Chorus]


[Verse 1]
Yeah...Gangsta Gangsta WHATS UP WHATS UP YEAH
Comin' fresh out that Pyrex pot
black Air Force 2's and the White Sox..
fitted on my forehead, try me, go head
I'll bring out the polka dots, put Kwame on your forehead
Yeah, it's the new king of everything
and bitches don't say no to me, I'm like a wedding ring
Maybe it's how I pour that Patron
maybe it's how I smell a Paris Hilton Cologne
Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone
and I'm sick of blow jobs, bitch leave me alone
And tell Dr. Dre to pick up a phone
before I climb through his window like "Nigga I'm Home"
Runnin' the rock like OJ, nigga it's a throwback
Fuck a Aston Martin, show me where the stone fat
Get a jar, some baking soda, nigga hold that
the world is my grandma's kitchen, time to cook crack

[Chorus]
The Dope Boys in the building
What's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys
What's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys

What's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys
Yeah? The Dope Boys in the building

[Verse 2]
You couldn't smell that crack comin' out that motherfucking Porsche truck
I stop traffic with the rims that I'm sittin' on
Them ain't high beams, bitch my wrist is on
The same shit that Ludacris is on
Disturbing the peace if my stash missing stones
Yeah, count that work like a paycheck
niggas couldn't play The Game in a tapedeck
A boss never touch work if it ain't taped yet
That's how you get fucked, I practice safe sex
and I take ya boy Curtis bitch with my tongue
lick lick lick like Shawna and have her sprung
Show her my Anaconda and have her sprung
and put it all in her stomach and just UHH!!!

[Chorus]
What's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys
What's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, What's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys
What's up? The Dope Boys in the building

Detroit, What's up? ATL, what's up? The Dope Boys
MIA what's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, what's up?

[Verse 3]
So roll that coke white carpet to the hood
It's the Dope Boys reunion, the dress code's strictly
white tee, Air Force 1's and some Dickies
I'm from the city where the skinny niggas die
Only birds and Nextels chirp in the sky
And we ride for the letters on our fitted cap
niggas hit the stash, get a strap, and go get it back!
That's for the gangstas, the hustlers, the ballas
from Downtown LA to Uptown Harlem
And D-Boy money ain't rain and it's stormin'
So stop the music when the Champagne pouring
And hold the glasses high
and when a nigga ask you why, you tell 'em..

[Chorus]
The Dope Boys in the building
What's up? The Dope Boys. What's up? The Dope Boys
What's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The Dope Boys. I'm back! The Dope Boys
I'm back! The Dope Boys in the building
Yeah, what's up? The Dope Boys. Nigga what's up? The Dope Boys
Motherfucker what's up? The Dope Boys in the building
Tell 'em I'm back! The Dope Boys. Cause I'm back! The Dope Boys
It's a wrap! The Dope Boys in the building

The Dope Boys, The Dope Boys
The Dope Boys in the building

The Dope Boys, The Dope Boys

Yeah, what's up? What's up?

Hahaha, yeah

The King is back!


[Intro/Chorus - Keyshia Cole]
Eyyy-yeaa...
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaah...
Heeeey, yeah...
See ever since the day I got the chance to make a change
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known 'cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage 'cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah

[The Game]
I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'ma take you there like B.I.G took niggaz to New York
"Juicy" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's "Summertime", shout out to Will Smith
'cause who didn't wanna be the (Fresh Prince)?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me "Money Make the World go Round"
and Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for "Love LA"
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
And ever since the day I got the chance to make a change 
I've been in this game, it's a new day
And I'm makin it known 'cause, I just want the world to know
I'm payin my dues, and I got the utmost, I just wanna let you know
I'm payin homage 'cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah

[The Game (Keyshia Cole)]
Public Enemy and N.W.A
is on my boombox, had to say
"Today was a Good Day" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggaz cain't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was "Boyz N the Hood"
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the "Boomin' System"
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin
Every girl at'cha school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin like New Edition
'cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggaz came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
'cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say "It Never Rain in Southern California", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Cash Rules Everything Around Me, C.R.E.A.M get the money
in the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say "WHOA!"
Everything full circle, Game livin major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky 'cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggaz gon' quote me

[Chorus]

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
See, Mary J. I want you to understaaaaand..
You paved the way (for me)
I'm givin homage (to you)

(make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice on ice, on ice, on ice, yeah)

You know me I turn them 40 bottles upside down
like niggaz with dead homies till it's empty like my 4 pound.
Niggaz thinkin I'm drunk
reach 4 my N.W.A chain and get ur ass beat wit da pump.
Tell security it's Game plus 50
and he probably gets fucked up every night like Bobby did Whitney.
Fuck poppin crystal
I got a bottle of henny
me and my nine stay together like Hardaway and lil'Penny
I ain't here so u can ask about Em or Dre
I came to see some bitches shake their ass like BeyoncÃÂ©.
So let me be hov' 4 a minute
get up in your hoe 4 a minute
and u could be my hoe 4 a minute.
Like I'm Diddy
be J-Lo 4 a minute
from the windows to the wall gettin low while I'm in it.
All I gotta do is hit em with a Jay-Z line
like u deserve to be my sunshine.

[Chorus - Jay Love:]
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
tell her where the af-
ter party is
but make sure that you see her friends before,
before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh

I'll spend a hundred dollars take a bitch to the hyatt,
then treat her like Busta like her ass on fire.
I'm a gangsta mah,
i wanna see you wiggle your butt cheeks both hands round your ankles mah.
all I wanna see is ass and titties.
shake it like they do in magic city
with T.I. in that mothafucka,
I'm like 50, be high in this motha fucka
You the them gold D's on that Porsche Truck
I show you how gangstas fuck
my 45 to the back of your weak
both of your arms in handcuffs
Take a bottle of Cisco to the head
see how you like getting fucked with a pistol to ya head.
tell ya girls I fucked your brains out,
we can do a manage-a-trois, pull the whips and chains out
I tear that frame out
I ain't no stunt man
I pull that range out
"BITCH"

[Chorus - Jay Love:]
See her on the Floor
She's sexy
tell her where the af-
ter party is
but make sure that you see her friends before,
before, before, mmmmmmmmhhh

I got 40's like the liquor store,
pour it on your weave like that bitch in the g-thang video.
You look wet, let me help you out your Von Dutch's
I know you used to niggas spinning but tonight I'm fucking,
the truck stop, the rims spin, I know they hate me fuck em.
It's killa cally nigga haters come a dime a dozen
Load em shells then I get drunk pissy,
this bottle of Hennessy got me wanting to fuck Missy.
I'm a gangsta I can turn that bitch out,
play with her pussy then drop extasy in her crystal,
60 seconds later I'm kicking that bitch out.
then ride down the show with the 4-5th out stop at the store
that bitch emptied my Cris out
give me 50 feet or I'll empty this clip out.
Niggas wanna know what this LA shit 'bout
just visit when the Bloods and Crips' out

(Is there anymore any more (hard liquor))

(make sure that it's mixed and twisted with a little bit of lemon juice on ice, on ice, on ice, yeah)


(Dodge this)

[Verse 1]
Catch me if you can I'm in those old school Barkley's
Back to the fence, puffin on that Bob Marley
Flow like oregano, nigga you already know
My competition's stiffer than Ronald Regan, let it go
Befo' you be a motherfuckin vegetable
You scrap niggas too animated like The Incredibles
Let this beef go around like the 26's
It's young Game of flame, welcome to the House of Pain
Nigga what about The Game?
Keep on playin boy, I'll hop out this fuckin Range
Look I ain't even ask for his fuckin chain
But he took it off like Vanessa-Del-Rio
Now I'm on my way to Rio
After I see my P.O.
She cool, she a Leo
She ain't trippin' off the weed smoke
So I'ma blow it like the Patriots
And throw my dub up, cus Dr. Dre made me rich

[Chorus: The Game]
Where you from? (California)
What city? (Compton)
What you drive? (Impala)
What you smokin' on? (Chronic)
What you drinkin' on? (Patron)
What you sittin' on? (The throne)
Relax, make yourself at home

[Traci Nelson]
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton

[Verse 2]
I wrote the block off, I talk that shit
Size 12 Bo Jacksons cause I walk that shit
There on Compton Blvd that's where I walk my pits
Biggie and 2Pac and they bark like this...
As I spark my splif
I see the coroner puttin' chalk around the snitch
We be shootin like free throws, flying them desert Eagles
Sell dope to the Po' while we eat chili Fritos
From a gang banger to a CEO
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-Leo
Won't stop till I'm dead
Ain't gotta watch for the Feds
They ain't watchin me so here's a dome shot to the head
As I take a Patron shot to the head
And reminise about the shit the D.O.C. said
"Get money, get cars, get mine, get yours,
And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors"

[Chorus: The Game]
Where you from? (California)
What city? (Compton)
What you drive? (Impala)
What you smokin' on? (Chronic)
What you drinkin' on? (Patron)
What you sittin' on? (The throne)
Relax, make yourself at home

[Traci Nelson]
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton
Welcome to Compton

[Verse 3]
Guess it's time to break the number 9 Jordan's in
Make a nigga mad when they been trying ta' floor the Benz
I'm doin 160 in the fast lane
Scott Storch in his Bugatti couldn't pass Game
I got it made like my last name
I'm gone just like my Aftermath Chain
Don't make me take you back to '96
Leanin' on that Datsun on the corner eating catfish
The Game, da-da-da Game spit 'dat shit
I'm controversial like the Afro pic with the black fist
Just ask the rapper that had to catch my last diss
I'm reckless and I ain't never crash whips
My pops wasn't around so this bastard
Bleed California from the cradle to the casket
And I won't stop ridin' for my coast
Niggas keep talkin 'bout my bread, we gonna make toast

[Chorus: The Game]
Where you from? (California)
What city? (Compton)
What you drive? (Impala)
What you smokin' on? (Chronic)
What you drinkin' on? (Patron)

Welcome to Compton


[Intro: The Game]
Put your lighters up if you want to
Pull your motherfucking Dodger cap
Over your motherfucking eyes, 'til you can't see shit
I want you to go blind nigga
So you can feel how I felt, when I was in that motherfucking coma

[Chorus: Shorty]
Raised in the City of Angels where it's safe
And danger switch lanes so stranger drive slow (drive slow)
Where bangers and gangstas, fast women'll bank up
Just, part of a face, that we show
We got mountains and ocean, we move in slow motion
Off that sticky you walk up to go
I swear, ain't nothing better there
That's why we all take our hats off to you, the one more

[The Game]
Come to my hood hood, look at my block block
That's that project building, yeah that's where I got shot, shot
Cause I was more hood than Suge, had more rocks than Jay
More scars on my face than the original "Scarface," or the homeboy Scarface
Al Pacino couldn't be no gangsta, DeNiro in "Casino" he no gangsta
Wanna be, wanna see, wan' get a shovel
dig Tookie up nigga, cause he know gangstas
Niggas think cause they watched "Menace" a couple times
Seen Cube in "Boyz N the Hood" and pressed rewind
That you could survive when a real Crip
run up on your car and flexed a nine?
You must be out of yo' mind, a real Blood'll put you out of yo' mind
Just stay the fuck up outta my hood
where my niggas take you up outta yo' shine
It ain't a movie dawg, hell yeah this a real fucking Uzi dawg
I'm 'bout to hop inside my Impala, try to keep up, don't lose me y'all

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I know the real O-Dog, and that nigga know the real Game
I call him Lorenz Tate, and he ain't never been in no gang
But he been in my house house, and he sat on my couch couch
While I put one in the air so yeah that nigga know what I'm 'bout, 'bout
I'm 'bout my hood, I'm 'bout my block, I'm 'bout my chips
So if the rap money stop and I punch a clock
catch you slippin at a light {GET OUT YO' SHIT!}
You jack niggas, out-of-towners, and rap niggas
And ball players cause we ball player, we chop it up, with them trap niggas
We (OutKasts), we (Big Boi's), (Ludacris) with them big toys
Where I'm from it's only two things
standing on the corner, me and that liquor store
Look what the Bloods did to Weezy, look what the Crips did to Jeezy
This gangbangin shit ain't nothing to play with
Me and Snoop Dogg just made it look easy

[Chorus]

[Outro: The Game]
Y'all niggas got this L.A. shit real fucked up man
Niggas better start respectin what the fuck we about man
We take niggas the fuck out, this shit ain't no movie dawg
This shit is real - Crips, Bloods, Ese's
We hold shit down, this L.A.
Word to shit on my face, put a motherfucking star behind it
What the fuck I am, Star-face
L.A. Chronicles, L.A.X. Files
Case closed


Yeah, Scott Storch

[The Game]
Yo I'm hoping out a Phantom with a' iced out medallion
Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cus hustlers hit the block when police change shifts 
New York, California different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands
Still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped many men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy who I sound like?
Don't ask me that's my nigga we classy
Him and  Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tape it up fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood just hate my shine
We coming out we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

[The Game]
Now who the fuck want war with the human gun store?
Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan 
What the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94 shooing out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas take they money shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money nigga get paid quick
And don't save shit

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood just hate my shine
We coming out we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

Lord knows that money don't matter
Lord knows that status is badder
Lord knows about the hood I live in
He's taking away but he's giving
Now don't give me these cars
Don't give me these mansions
Don't hate me just let me ride, Lord just give me light

[The Game]
I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P
That was a phase I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of Gandhi
Criminal minded city behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I should of put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third motherfucker that's my word
There's some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb
I was ultimate warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully axe niggas
Like Snoop or Suge I'm in the coupe I'm good
Mothafuckas make way

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
All my hoods on the real dark side of the track
No sunny sky's just really black
We live real down here, Lord let us live
No playing around here, Lord let us live
Don't hate my hood just hate my shine
We coming out we on our grind
We live real down here, Lord let us live
We coming outta here, Lord let us live

[The Game]
Is that Michelle Chrisette
Black Wall, Coollie High, Scott Storch, let's ride
'08 to infinity
California, New York
Scott Storch, Scott Storch...


[The Game]
Second floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up bout to blaze
And zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze
As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mom free, so my mom free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face... 
Cause sometimes I wanna give up and at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face... 

[singing]

[Nas]
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seating and greeting
I've been meanin' to do me some letter reading
to the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be aloud at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your world awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have the march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart, we miss you... 
Feel like King be in me sometimes

[singing]

[The Game]
The word nigger, is nothin' like nigga
Don't sound shit alike - like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's "Umbrella"
for Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
that the future just took a fuckin' head shot... 
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer? Probably not... 

[singing]


[The Game]
Kanye told me that "Jesus Walks" in '04
But I grew up around Impala's and drug lords
Welcome to Los Angeles, palm trees and drug stores
All we know is rocks and presidents like Mount Rushmore
Fuck the police, they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for
My money or my glock, who do I trust more?
I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green, 'cause paper motivate niggaz
And my Rolex racist 'cause it hate niggaz
I used to only sell 8's like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24's like I play at the Staples Center
You might miss The Game so nigga don't blink
My Phantom stand out like Frank Lucas' mink
So go ahead and think, like Frank Lucas think
Somebody'll find your brains on the fuckin' kitchen sink about

[Chorus]
Dead presidents, big paper ("for the money")
Benjamins, skyscrapers, my niggaz get ("money")
My bitches get ("money") like the strippers get
From the block to the club I'll make it rain ("money")
In California niggaz die ("for the money")
From the South to New York, them bullets fly for the ("money")
Don't stop gettin' ("money") It don't matter where you from
If you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that ("money")

[The Game]
I get it, that Baby and Slim, Cash Money
All the jewelry on your whole crew, that's my tax money
That Pablo Escobar crack money
That LeBron first Nike contract money
That make it rain, all my niggaz throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceilin' then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of Love, Deelishis sittin' on my lap money
That rap money, niggaz get clapped money
Air Force One's don't bend when I trap money
Ooooh, I'm Rich like Porter
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that water
Like McDonald's, I was flippin' them orders
In that '02 Porche truck, whizzin' through borders
I was through flippin' quarters when I made my first mill'
I'm about a dollar, 50 Cent ain't real?

[Chorus]
Dead presidents, big paper ("for the money")
Benjamins, skyscrapers, my niggaz get ("money")
My bitches get ("money") like the strippers get
From the block to the club I'll make it rain ("money")
In California niggaz die ("for the money")
From the South to New York, them bullets fly for the ("money")
Don't stop gettin' ("money") It don't matter where you from
If you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that ("money")

[The Game]
Somebody tell Snoop to pop open them briefcases
Order that Patron, tell 'em we want three cases
Fuck a black car, you see these green faces?
Look at my chest, now you seen fakers
Treat my money like the Cristal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine, I could re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy could see Jason
I've been iced out, like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient, but I want
money like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons
Word to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick
Then I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no engles but dinero I talk it fluent

[Chorus]
Dead presidents, big paper ("for the money")
Benjamins, skyscrapers, my niggaz get ("money")
My bitches get ("money") like the strippers get
From the block to the club I'll make it rain ("money")
In California niggaz die ("for the money")
From the South to New York, them bullets fly for the ("money")
Don't stop gettin' ("money") It don't matter where you from
If you hustle motherfucker keep gettin' that ("money")


Punk-ass motherfucker!
Bitch-ass nigga!
You's gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep you bitch-ass nigga?
Tupac, Biggie shut the fuck up!
Fucking dogs, they barking and shit
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Fuck you nigga!

[Lil' Wayne:]
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
'Cause they say, "You ain't grindin' until you die."
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life

[The Game:]
Take me away from the hood
Like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood
In a casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away
Like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide
I'm from a Windy City
Like Do or Die
From a block close to
Where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus
Shot for no fucking reason
And you wonder why Kanye
Wears Jesus pieces
My life!
'Cause that's Jesus people
And Game he's the equal
Hated on so much
Passion Of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Rock-a-fella needed a Siegal
Like I needed my father
But he needed a needle
My life!
I need some meditation
So I can lead my people
They askin' why?
Why did John Lennon leave The Beetles?
And why every hood nigga
Feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this
Bullet leave this Desert Eagle

[Lil' Wayne:]
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
'Cause they say, "You ain't grindin' until you die."
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life

[The Game:]
We are not the same
I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'
I earned them

And I ain't no preacher but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music, and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson 'cause it ain't about race now

[Original lines:
"And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned them
So there's no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
And since there ain't no Proof I'll never walk through 8 Mile.":]

Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
And since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like MJB, no more drama now
Livin' the good life
Me and Common on common ground
I spit crack
And niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mind state
I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty
Like a Glock without a round
Now my life full
Like a chopper with a thousand rounds

[Lil' Wayne:]
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
'Cause they say, "You ain't grindin' until you die."
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?
My life

[The Game:]
Walk through the gates of hell
See my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on
Me and the devil
Sharing chronic blunts
Listening to The Chronic album
Playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus
For target practice
My mind fucked up, so I
Cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you
Motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could
My life
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't
Escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas
That I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me
That make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom
Just the way I should
With the top back
And my Sox hat
I'm paid in full
The nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

[Lil' Wayne:]
And I'm grindin' until I'm tired
'Cause they say, "You ain't grindin' until you die."
So I'm grinding with my eyes wide
Looking to find
A way through the day
A life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wondering why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right?

My life
My life
My life
My life


"93.5 K-DAY, givin you the taste of good life, your girl Yo-Yo.
Should I say is it still all good?
Today at 12:45 outside the Petersen Museum here in Los Angeles,
Notorious B.I.G. was gunned down and pronouced dead at 1:15 this morning.
As a result of the ongoing feud between East and West coast,
the tragic death of Tupac Shakur who was gunned down in Las Vegas
just six months earlier, our prayers go out to the families."

"Westside Radio, Julio G.
A sad day today for the West coast; we lost an icon y'all.
Eric 'Eazy-E' Wright, passed away today at 6:45 PM,
Cedars Sinai Hospital, due to complications from AIDS.
A definite West coast legend, brought you N.W.A.,
brought you Michel'le, brought you D.O.C., and the list goes on.
We definitely gon' miss you Eazy."

[The Game - impersonating 2Pac]
Picture me rollin in that black B-M-dub, headed to the club
Fresh out the Tyson fight, Beamer all rimmed up
Shinin with the big homie, five-car caravan
Ridin shotgun, put that chronic smoke in the air
"Me Against the World" is what I told my foes
So it's me against the world, 'til they poke them hoes
Leanin out the window, flickin ashes off the indo
Throwin up Westside, I see, some of my kinfolk
Pull that blunt closer to my mouth cause only she know
I'm feelin bad about that nigga we stomped out in that casino
But fuck it it's Death Row - the big homie never told me 
that my next blow could be my fuckin death blow
Tell Kidada I'm not ready, I ain't even let my momma know
I ain't got no kids, I'm only twenty-fo'
Before I can let the smoke out, niggaz let twenty go
The thirteen that hit the car was through the passenger do'
Now come wit it

[Chorus: Latoya Williams]
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (to my friends)
Never can say goodbye, never can say goodbye (I will always keep you near)

[The Game - impersonating Notorious B.I.G.]
I love it when they call me Big Popp-a
I only smoke blunts if they roll prop-a
Look I gots ta, catch the first thing smokin in Cali
And hit one of my bitches in the valley
Gotta call my nigga Sean, tell him reserve the don
Tell him to get the chron' and the teflon
I think they trippin off the homie gettin shot
But God bless his soul, Lord know it wasn't Pop
or the M.A.F.I.A., Kim tell Cease get the fuckin truck
We 'bout to hit the Wilshire district, get fucked up
Pop mad bottles son, twist up the Phillies
I'm thinkin 'bout T'yanna, these niggaz is lookin silly
If this was Blook-lyn I would up the 9-milli
But fuck it we to the truck, roll the dutch, we out of Phillies
Hop in the front seat, of that dark green Suburban
Heard another car swervin, gunshots close the curtains; Biggie!

[Chorus]

[The Game - impersonating Eazy-E]
Layin in this hospital bed with bronchitis, I can't talk
Walked myself in and all of a sudden I can't walk
IV's in my arm, my wife Tomica at my legs
(Ruthless), I mean Records, we got married on my deathbed
I could hear Jerry Heller in the hall
But I couldn't hear Cube and Dr. Dre no more at all
Through all the bullshit them niggaz was my dawgs
Niggaz With Attitudes spraypainted on the walls
I'm flatlinin, it's bad timin
(Straight Outta Compton), the king of gangsta rap's dyin
Cause of death, the AIDS virus
Conspiracy, I guess the government just hate violence
They thought my group influenced the L.A. riots
Woulda been here to see my kids grow, if I stayed quiet
Took 12 years for a real nigga to break silence
Eazy I had to let 'em know
You could catch me, cruisin down the street in my six-fo'

[Chorus]


Ayo, Irv, 'the fuck is wrong with these niggas, man?
Talking 'bout I aint no fuckin MC
I been at this shit for 7 years, nigga
8 times platinum, nigga
2 Bentleys, 1 Lambo and 3 houses later
Muthafucka, what's up?

[Verse 1]
Naw, this aint no fucking Dre beat, I got this from Irv Gotti
Game back on the shit I'm enemies with e'rybody
Game cook crack, transform to yeyo
The new Suge Knight, nigga, minus the K.O.
I keep it candy like Mariah, I'm so fire
When step it in the club, "Get Low" like Flo Rida
Cus I'm a pimp, you can tell by the limp
When I st-st-st-step aside the 26 inch
You see my rims? They bigger than Bow Wow
Get money, fuck bitches, that's what I'm about now
The Phantom, ugly, the Bentley, retarded
The kicks still Chuck Taylors, the jacket is a Starter
I beg your pardon, nigga, we can get started
If you aint Nas or that nigga on third Carter
My happy face is Kenneth Supreme mug shot
When it go down, who goin' stop the blood clot?

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

[Verse 2]
Nigga I'm a throw back, you already know that
Got swag and I'm street, picture the nigga Hov' strapped
And it's the rock right in my fuckin sock
Die for my chain, why?
So I can go fuck with Pac
Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops
Hit one for Sean Bell then bleed on the block, yeah
Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid
Got a snub nose, call it Big Tig
You art not fuck with Game, he crazy
And the bars comin' straight outta Compton, baby
My 16's mean, you know what I mean
Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens
Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things
My shorty is a 10, that's that singing nigga, Dream
The life of gangsta in Cali, is to short
So I might as well find me a borrow in New York

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

[Verse 3]
Man you know, I don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
Any drama, I'm locked on like a red-nose pit
Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips
Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
Give a fuck if you tuff nigga, or you buff nigga
My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas
Hop out the truck with the gun so long
Let the bullets jump out and ask, "What's going on?"
What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard
Got sick in the Impala so I threw up a Aston
I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist slit
My entourage shine like the Diamond District
I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex
With so many rock, the Africans is trying to protest
Bully of the block, why? Cus they got me top 5
There's four niggas better than me? Nigga, stop lyin!

[Chorus: Newz (The Game)]
Throw yo hands up it's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit
Go ahead and hate on my click
Got a couple words for you nigga, suck my dick
You strapped? (That's right)
Gang bangin? (for life)
A little drama (that's life)
Hit 'em up (Nice)
It's that gangsta shit
All the homies go crazy when they bump my shit

Newz!
Niggas better know what the fuck they dealin with
When they dealing with the fuck they dealin with
You dealin with a fuckin animal, man
Gotti will tell you, nigga, both the Gottis, nigga
You can bring John Gotti back too, nigga
He'll tell you, man
I'm gangsta, nigga
I was Murda Inc. before anything, man
Black Wall Street, Murda Inc., man
Before there was a Dr. Dre there was a Irv Gotti, nigga
When I was running around with P. Diddy in Atlanta, nigga
Slapping asses, nigga
Mario ?? know what it is, nigga
Mix bitches all up in the height on Peach St., nigga
Been getting money, nigga
7 years strong, nigga
2 platinum albums, nigga
'Bout to be three
Ay, nigga that's muthafuckin hip hop menage a trios

California ain't a state it's a army!

[Verse 1]
One fuckin nigga in the projects killin'
The same motherfucker that would burn down the villains
Where the niggas blunt full of that
You know, who gone take you back to Compton In that 64 two door
Sub woofers in the trunk kickin' that lethal injection
A hood nigga lost with no direction
so he bought a black smith & wesson
strapped on his vest and that's his protection
At the intersection waitin' on the robber
cuz in the city of Angels it's all about survival
motherfuck the 5-0, They wanna see you DOA, welcome to L.A.
Where the ghetto birds flyin over my auntie's and my cuzin's house
tell me what they buzzin bout
the little homie got smoked on the corner
And now his momma cryin', dead in califronia

[Chorus 2x (Ice Cube & The Game)]
Motherfuckers ain't gone learn
Till the chronic blunt don't burn
And you can't see nuthin' but the ghetto bird light shinin
through the fuckin' palm trees
California ain't a state it's a army

[Verse 2]
Jumped in my impala took a trip to the swap meat
The scoop bought EGO trippin and some white T's
Cus some niggas in my old hood don't like me
time to put the niggas on check, like my Nike's
shoulda heard my my nigga Mack 10 on the chirp
All I need is me and my bitch
If you scared go to church
Cuz in Califorinia niggas crack heads for the turf
And life ain't nuthin but Teck-9's and dirt
Dippin through the the jungles, my escalade hit a dip
Here come the gorillas in the mist
and they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96
Stone cold jherri curl and not one drip
I sleep with the worms before I swim with the fish
And I ride with my niggas before I roll witta bitch
If it don't make dollars it don't make sense
And I almost got shot because I hit a fence

[Chorus 2x (Ice Cube & The Game)]

[Verse 3]
Call the U.S. government and tell em it's a mutherfuckin code red
Niggas tried to straight up jack me and now they both dead
third little nigga got away on his mo-ped
caught him 'round the corner put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the impala then smashed through the light
without a one time in sight
So I bust a right on Century headed to the L.A.X.
where there ain't nuthin but fly bitches and checks
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked
Off Brand a nigga in the 600 throwin up his set
he must don't know I got the 40 on deck
and the tec tryin be shit time to flex
it's the third this shit happened to me all day
guess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away
So I turned down my Spice 1 tape and hit the switch
emptied the whole clip in his fuckin face

[Chorus 2x (Ice Cube & The Game)]

California ain't a state it's a army!


[The Game]
You see that cherry red Phantom on them big ass wheels
You see I be playing with them cars, I'm like a big ass kid
Crazy with that cap gun, so if we play cops and robbers
I'll show you how to pop revolvers
Fitted cap too big, so it cover my eyes
That lambo? That ain't shit, just a public disguise
And that top model chick, she for the diamond lane
And I be driving all crazy cuz my diamond chain is (bright)
As them Las Vegas lights
it be the same in California when I'm riding at night
In New York, I be in Midtown, up and down Broadway
Having meetings all day, baby my future is (bright)
As Lebron's, take off on anybody
Tyra Banks on my arm, and we'll crash any party
Yeah, making it rain, ain't got shit on me
The way I ball, the fuckin owner should come sit on me
Yeah, I'm fresh out of jail, you shoulda knew I was back
Turn on the radio it's a rap

[Ludacris]
[Talking]
Just touched down at L.A.X. LUDA!
That's Right! What up Game? Fresh out huh?

Don't you hear it? That nigga named Luda
Slicker than Rick the Ruler, whoop ass like Lex Luger
My money long, your shit is shorter than Oompa Loompas
And I'll superman, yuuuh, that ass like Lex Luther
Shoot you then say me gusta, I'll take you to meet ya maker
My dick's the Staples Center I'll take you to see the Lakers
Swoosh! On that Cali kush, smoking like a muffler
So many red flags I coulda swore I was in Russia
Game! I got the fame and the fortune, Compton is scorchin
Get rid of bullets, my gun keeps havin abortions
I ain't havin it, see em in the dead zone
Fake dope boys is more bass up in my head phones
Adjust your treble, I'm heavier than metal
My verses are hot as shit like I recorded with the Devil
I'm on another level, they stuck on the elevator
And I'm about to blow this bitch, Game press the detonator, like
Fresh out of Georgia, ya heard I was back, turn on the radio, it's a rap

[The Game]
See I'm come from the bottom and they call me The Game
But I'm just happy that Beyonce know my name
I took that Dr Dre money and I bought me chain
Then I bought me a house, then I bought me a Range
Then I bought me some pussy, then I bought me some brains
But I ain't buyin' that the best rappers is Kanye and Wayne
See both of them niggas spit, but yall act like you don't hear me spit
Like sellin' 7 million records ain't the shit
I don't win no Grammies, nigga I'm too gangsta
And poppin Cristal with Irv don't make me a wanksta
See I'm California certified, my niggas make the murder rise
Readin my fan mail in jail, Buck told Curtis bye
So I'mma break it down for them niggas in the South
Slow it down but this Rolls Phatom 
grill in my mouth
Throw the Prada slippers on, when I walk in my house
P Diddy and Tommy Lee know what I'm talking about
See, I'm fresh out of jail, you shoulda knew I was back
Turn up the radio it's a rap


Alameda, Alameda
Alameda, Alameda
Alameda, Alameda
Alameda, Alameda

Nigga pause when you see us
Fat red laces in them Grant Hill Filas
Young misfits, born underachievers
Mama couldn't feed us, white sheets when you leave us
We be fucking with hood rats, gang bang divas
One braiding hair, one lacing my Adidas
Looking at them train tracks, niggas scared to cross 'em
Them same fucking train tracks run all the way to Slauson
Running from the T-Flats, tryna keep 'em off us
Look over my shoulder, pray to God that I lost 'em
Bust ninas and toss 'em, screaming out what what
Westside Compton, nigga we don't give a fuck fuck
Nigga preach, dead in the coffin
Let the preacher praise, paramedics bring us off
Nigga rest in peace, blowing reefer

Cedar Block Bompton Piru, that's on my see through
YG blowing speakers, riding down
Alameda, Alameda
Alameda, Alameda

Niggas run up on this red '64
You get a white tag on your big toe
These ain't punch lines, niggas kick doors
Leave your baby mama with her lip swole
All handguns, niggas pack light
Nigga's mouth loose but my strap tight
Niggas slide through and they bust first
We killin' everybody that night
Block wars, we bout that life
Scuffed J's and them fist fights
Dead bodies on dead bodies
Savage, that's what I live like
Go and chop a nigga head off
Fuck around, let the rounds hit you
Blood splattered on a nigga's [?]
All I had to do was give a signal
Magazines if you got an issue
Hit one nigga with the source
Hit two niggas with the vibe
Bitch I kill your vibe
It's a reason niggas can't fuck with ya
I'm a Compton nigga and I don't give a fuck
Nigga walk around with that pistol tucked

Pull up on your block, take that shit over
Stolen choppers out of stolen Rovers
Supernova bullets rippin' through Corollas
Pure shooter like DeMare DeRozan
Hot slugs but the jewelry frozen
12 gauges on the trap sofas
Naked bitches in the kitchen whippin' yola
Pockets fat like a young Oprah
Told the nigga he ain't want the clip
I'm filthy rich and still with the shit
His mama cryin' but his son a bitch
I had her view the body like she from the 6
Bullets ricochetin' all through the block
Nigga run his mouth like he knew the cops
I do the shootin' while the shooters watch
Then cook crack in a newer pot
Move me? Gotta move the block
That means take shots like it's Lou Dot
Niggas talkin' bout the game like it's ESPN

No conscious mind, the chronic got
My mind blown

I'll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in

Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them
Empty out the clip then I'm hopping on that 110
Freeway, that i10 freeway

Gone tomorrow, etch-a-sketch them niggas
18th streets to the grapes
Niggas catching bodies over Jordan 5 grapes
Is it worth it? Yeah when you born worthless
Catch the bus to Beverly Hills and snatch purses
Preachers calling serpents when they worship, so it's us against them
Let the steam hit the skin when that pot working
From random tears to chandeliers
Pouring 40s for my peers, but my enemies

I'll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in
Walking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in
Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them

Chickens on the move, nigga it's a relay
I got them unmarked bills in that briefcase with that new face in that blue tape
Throwing Wingstop up out my window
You don't like my flow, I guess it's time to switch the tempo
I can pull a model bitch inside of Bento, fresh as Mentos
Where you get them Js? Jordan sent those
Got my Glock cocked 'case a nigga think he fit those
Then his shit blow like it's endo, over them custom kicks though
Hot then cold, hot chain then froze, but it's play to end goal
Riding round in those
Red Octobers in July, got 'em, you lie, you ran puddles
Peyton Manning with the cannon, nigga no huddle
Noah butter, when you the king of the square, it's no trouble
When the city love you but them haters nigga

I'll read you a bedtime story, you can get your ass tucked in
Walking down Wilmington, my bandanna tucked in
Shooting out the window at my enemies, like fuck them
Empty out the clip then I'm hopping on that 110

Let me walk through a day inside the dope spot
Bullet proof cars like the pope got
Fingers knockin' at my door, 6AM
I hope not
That shit be fuckin' with the business when the stove hot
Well look at me in the kitchen with the stove top
Ziplock bag, distribution to the whole block
Shit the whole city
We got the Paris Hilton, make your nose pretty
Make them fat hoes skinny
You got the smoke, we supply the chimney
Then we on the porch sippin' Mickeys like I know Minnie
Bitch lookin' for mollies? Tell her I got plenty
I'm in that cherry red Chevy right outside Denny's
You know me, lowkey
Window cracked and he blowin' that Ashton Kutch
Like he macked Demi
You gun talkin'? See that black semi
Blood spillin' blood on them black pennys nigga that's gutter

Gutter, gutter
Nigga that's gutter
Gutter, gutter
Keep it gutter

Guess that's my mind frame
Niggas can't kill me cause they ain't tryna find Game
Even if they was I'm at the Staples, Louboutin frames
Feet on the wood, nigga I could trip Lebron James
I keep it hood
Bandana with that bang bang
Red rag .45, that's the same thing
I take the same route home in the same lane
Same car, same nigga, just the fame changed
I walk around like I never heard the same Game
Watch Menace To Society but caine caine
Then I became king leader of the chain gang
Still park my Rolls Royce and hop back on the same train
Then hop out on the same street
Where the dealers and the fiends eat
Where the killers and the everything in-between meet
Get your face covered with that white sheet
That nigga died over Twitter beef
Tryna keep it gutter

Tryna keep it gutter
Keep it gutter
Tryna keep it gutter
Gutter, gutter
Nigga that's gutter


Walkin' out the pen with my pen, live a life of sin
Tell the devil throw me a shovel and let's get it in
2015 MC Ren, this ain't a movie
Pull my khaki suit back out the closet and burn this Louie
Tell Young Thug come out the closet, the fuck you foolin'?
Where my crips, my bloods, my esses? Let's make some music
That the gangsters can dance to
Throw up your hands too
The indians is back, we want our motherfuckin' land too
The black Slim Shady is back with some M80s
In the back of the Mercedes
About to blow this motherfucker like a meth lab
Smokin' on that same bomb chronic Dre and Meth had
You know I got the best bag
Now watch me teach the world how to roll a blunt for the last time
Welcome to Cali where smoking's our favorite past time
And if a nigga need a gun he can mack mine
And everything inside

Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out

You see bitches on all fours
Switchers on all cars
Got used to drivin' them Bentley's
I guess I got off course
Got used to fuckin' them bitches
Used to 'em rollin' my blunts
In the studio with Doc, ain't see them hoes in months
I've been shacked up on LSU
Goin' crazy on LSD in a straight jacket, don't mess with me
Till I finish this album
Now I step inside the party with Hennessy and Bacardi
Pour a ziplock of mollies out [?]
I'm a lunatic
Disturb the peace like Ludacris
Me and Dre bump heads cause he give me advice
I never listen to that shit
He said don't put out mixtapes and I did that
He said leave his car parked right there
I stripped that, drove that
In the Lambo, blunts rolled fat
Pull up to the club like where the hoes at
Take a ho and fuck her, then ask a bitch where your clothes at
The door right there
I don't need you bitches, see the iPhone?
There's some more right there
Here's a glass for your tears, let 'em all right there
Compton, I was born right there
Park the red Lambo right there
Sign to the man right there
25 mil, more nightmares
Now I'm fuckin' everybody bitch
You think you got her on lock but you don't

Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out
Cause when the lights go out

That pistol talk when your mouth leak
Got a black Impala on Collins nigga
Got a Glock in air, standing in the back seat, I'm wildin' nigga
Long money, fuck a rubber band
On a paper chase, I do the running man
Stealth black chopper with the infrared beam on
50 round drum, if I run out of bullets, hit a nigga with the nina
Better hit a nigga with the scope
Bet he won't talk with his back on the rope
Floyd Mayweather with the chopper
When a nigga get to choppin' put a razor blade at a nigga throat
I don't fuck with no scared niggas
I never did and I never will
Let the Glock go bang, now you Kurt Cobain
Knock a nigga right out of real

Take a nigga back to Compton and chop a nigga body up
Take a trip to East LA and chop a new Maserati up
Take my black Bugatti, [?] on green leaf
Then hit Crenshaw doin' 300, nigga Chief Keef
Ridin' down Crenshaw, stuntin' with my bitch though, ballin'
I'm from Compton, she from Watts, but we both got pistols
Blowin' trees with the top down, word to YG
If you don't want a problem motherfucker, why speak?
Niggas kill my nigga Puff, tell them niggas drop me
Keep two K's in the back, shotty in the front and the chrome side beach
No disrespect to the Dogg or the city Long Beach
But I'm the king out here, motherfucker on me

I don't see nothing, I heard you talking about it
Pull up with Stunna leaning in that Bugatti
No we ain't trippin', I know you ain't about it
But I got my nina, don't leave the crib without it

Got twins if you know Tia, then you know Kia
Balling bitches ride Benz's, nigga, no gears
On my way to the lip, bumping on a lid
With a bitch that look like Pia Mia, nigga you should see her
Head like Sia, diamonds in her ear
Sipping brandy, plus the money long like Nia
And I feel like that went over your head
And I don't think you understood what I said
See Brandy was Nia Long's name in Boys In the Hood
Translation: dope boy in the hood
Get the packages out, the fiends is running the Rams is back

Used to be in G5s, now I'm in the G6
Used to be in GRs, now I'm with some G-Stars
Couple G's in every pocket, sitting where the G's are
Used to be in UG Village with my G ma
Hand on the Jesus, RIP to my G-Pa
See life is up and down like a seesaw
And everybody working tryna get they RiRi off
You got pregnant teens and absent fathers
Outta town niggas they clapped regardless
It's a trap for the young
If you ever answer wrong when they ask where you from
And niggas gotta watch them colors
They say banging played 'til they get they bodies verified by their mothers

If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don't work at your residence

[Verse 7 - Game:]
...For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Riding through the jungles in that muthafuckin' elephant
That's a gray ghost, with the ears on it
Swimming through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the muthafuckas in, made another mill'
Got a nigga feeling like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it whip his ass today

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Game]
You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is
Play your position for Berkin bags, we poppin' tags
Her shoe game sick, we drinkin' Ace out of Red Bottles
True gang shit, fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she's away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plate, yea my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

[Hook: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She knows she can get
All that, all that, all that

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I'm a skater
I love her like her daddy, told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I got her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, ya
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'm a make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said "I'm glad you ate it, where my cap & gown?"
Told her "I can be your chauffeur, " dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that's my M.O
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door, the D
Give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven screaming "Oh, Hell no!"
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
Cause she know me

[Hook: Jeremih]

[Outro: Fabolous]
I'm feeling your style
I'm loving your swag
I like how your jeans fit
You're killing that bag
You working them heels
Your diamonds are real
You give me the chills, girl
You all that...


[Verse 1: Game]
Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased did
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin' where the beach is
Time to show the world what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bullet proof cars in Sri Lanka
12 years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
10 thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemar
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cus that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

[Hook: Game]
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Look at Blood Diamonds
Blood Diamonds
Now take a look at Blood Diamonds

[Verse 2: Game]
How you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store
And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DEA ain't got a case, I'm a win that mothercuker
And it ain't about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin' each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese 2's
But nah, Mandela did 28 straight
Without a fucking complaint, put a afro on a saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Brutus killed Ceasar
And Judas killed Jesus
John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln
And you thought he freed slaves, what the fuck was you thinkin'
Nigga fuck Lincoln
I'm rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I'd rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin' teeth in
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that tile from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I Don't Like, so bring Chief Keef in
I don't like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit
Overcharging niggas an arm and leg just to make shit
And you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slaveships
That's the reason we hate shit, rob my own niggas for them

[Hook]


[Intro:]
We gonna let this motherfÃ¼cker breathe for a minute
It's still aftermath, it's still aftermath, yea
Now when I said we gon let this motherfÃ¼cker breathe
I meant this motherfÃ¼cking beat is dead
We gonna preform CPR to bring that motherfÃ¼cker back to life
Now let that motherfÃ¼cker breathe

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfÃ¼cker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Get motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie

[The Game:]
Notoriouses, bring that Benz in
I'm about a dollar, nigga fÃ¼ck 50 Cent
I heard Tony Yayo can't pay the rent
I heard Lloyd Banks can't pay the rent
I beat the G-Unit out of 40 Glocc
Sue me for forty grand, that same forty will get you shot
IPhone in my hand doing the forty whop
That nigga looked up and thought he saw 40 Pacs
Looking out of my window I see forty cops
Trying to serve me that subpoena, I'm on this Xbox
2 Chainz voice, smoking that Wiz Khalifa
Somebody pass to Waka Flocka, let me spit this ether
Yeah yeah yeah, till it blow the speaker
From eating Reese's Pieces to pulling guns out
For that Little Caesar's Pizza
All the way to jacking niggas for their Jesus Pieces
I'm God to you bÃ­tch ass niggas
Put that on Matthew, Paul and Peter

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfÃ¼cker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Get motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie

Compton's my city
That motherfÃ¼cker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Get motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie

[The Game:]
FÃ¼ck with me, fÃ¼ck with me
FÃ¼ck with me, nigga you stuck with me
Forever and ever and ever
Shyne Po ain't rich, Shyne Po
All the way in Belize with Kendrick's dick in his throat
Good kid, mad city, mad kid, bad city
Nothing from Compton could ever be trash
You hear that nigga voice sound like a dick in his ass
He reminiscing of Compton niggas bÃ­tch in prison
Used to be Christian, now that nigga Jew
Can't step foot in America so what he gone do
P. Diddy's stuntman, Jackie Chan your ass through
Hood pass revoked, get your fÃ¼cking brains blew
Blood on that yarmulke, now you really Piru
Soon as they killed Biggie that man became you
But you couldn't become him
Cause you were shooting at the roof

[Hook:]
Compton's my city
That motherfÃ¼cker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Get motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie

Compton's my city
That motherfÃ¼cker ain't never pretty
Gave Pac life then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Then motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie
Get motherfÃ¼ckers that killed Biggie

[Outro:]
I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
I said, I always wondered why Puff wasn't in that truck
Let that beat breathe, let that bÃ­tch breathe
This my motherfÃ¼cking city
Five motherfÃ¼cking albums
The documentary, classic
Doctor's Advocate, classic
Everything in between that shit
And Jesus Piece, classic


[Verse 1: Game]
I bumped Ether, bumped Takeover
Seein' Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop's makeover
And that very day you knew niggas was born
Tyler the Creators, Drake, J. Coles, and Big Seans
Time for the world to pay homage
Bow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit
Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit
I used to wanna be a little Hov
Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
Made a little money, bought me a little Rov'
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now
Thinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill
Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell

[Hook: K. Roosevelt]
Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

[Verse 2: Game]
Dre promised me records, I never got 'em
That's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real
Dre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin' the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, Em, 50
Me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360
Plus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries
I ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me
Fuck 'em all

[Hook]

[Break: K. Roosevelt]
See I been spendin' these late nights
Oo, girls I never seen gettin'
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With 'em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That's the way the story goes
But now, I can't feel my heart
But I just keep ridin', ridin'
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

[Hook]


Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high

Bout my business but I don't slack
This my celebration rap, so

[Hook x2]

[Lil Wayne:]
I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm goin' at your face, make up
These niggas need stitches cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration

Hoes down, B's up

[Wiz Khalifa:]

Rollin' and chokin' and movin' slow motion, I'm floatin' I'm gone

[Hook]


[Hook: Game]
I'm tryin' to go to church
Get some chicken wings, after that hit the strip club
See my hoes, TWERK!
See bad girls be at the strip club
Good girls, they be in CHURCH!
Always wonder why my grandmother
Try to get me to go to CHURCH!
Please Lord forgive me, I'm bout to take niggas to CHURCH!

[Verse 1: Game]
Christian Louboutins, they're my best friends
I'm bout to put these bitches to the test then
What ya callin' spikes?
What color that box?
Is that a white bag in it?
Yea? No? Hold up. Stop
You ain't bout that life (bout that life)
You ain't bout that life
You don't bounce that ass like, "Oh Lord!"
Then climb back up the pole to meet Christ
Saturday night, she twerkin it for a real nigga
These niggas hatin', I hate them niggas
Make me wanna bring back Tommy Hilfiger
I'm in love with' a stripper, Quotin' the nigga T-Pain

[Hook]

[Bridge: Trey Songz (and Game)]
I know this ain't the first night
Go on girl, just do your thang
Don't be actin' shy
Take a sip and just do it babe
Sittin here all night (just do it for me)
Don't waste no time girl (just do it for me)
Girl I pray that, me and you lay down
Come on baby, lay down, go on, lay down
Sooner or later, sooner or later
The way you move that ass [?]
Go on, baby, lay down

(CHURCH!) Lord save me!
(CHURCH!) Poppin' bands for my baby

[Verse 2: Game]
I'm a crucify that pussy
I'm a nail it here, I'm a nail it there
I'm a mail it here, I'm a mail it there
Doin' all this sippin' Belvedere
Gotta sheriff here and a baliff here
All we missin is a judge
One night with a random bitch, and she'll burn your ass like a rug
Real niggas gon' say that, real niggas don't play that
Real nigga'll take a basic bitch, then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin the best of you, gotta pull a ho outta that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a ho she got baptized
Put a couple hundreds in her Trues, tell a ho to get her act right
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
Red bottoms will make her fuck. You broke niggas don't stand a chance
CHURCH!

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: King Chip]
King Chip, eastside Cleveland ghetto mogul
You say, "Damn, you livin like that?"
I say, "Bitch, I told you."
Sunday mornin, extra clean, get these bitches off of him
I'm a roll through your hood, and collect my offering
Seen her with a group of friends, damn she got the best butt
Then she turned around, lookin like Morris Chestnut
Aww, hell no, God damn. What the fuck?
Even though shit a nigga still might fuck...
You can be my "Plan C", just in case my "A" and "B" can't cut
Guess what? A nigga so fresh to death, I'm decomposin'
I just copped a dope ass condo, just to keep some hoes in
What I'm gon' do with all these racks?
Damn, what she gonna do with all that ass?
That baby oil is Holy Water
Ever met a young nigga with too much cash?
Her baby daddy live by my words
Damn, she cold, she got them curves
Double parked outside of the club
Niggas like, "Damn, nigga got some nerves"
Smokin these L's in the pulpit
With OG Chuck in the cool bitch
Got ten thousand all in ones cause, damn, that ass is stupid (Haha!)

[Bridge]


[Bridge: Game]
Graveyards in my pocket.
Tombstones in my wallet.
If you talkin' 'bout my profit,
All I see is dead people.
All I see is dead people.
You starve so when my momma tryna make a couple dollars,
Any nigga with a problem, they be dyin' over dead people.
Muthafuckin' dead people.

[Verse 1: Game]
This shit gets deep.
Don't fuck with me.
You end up six feet deep.
Listen to how I did it.
I crept up slow on Willow.
Thinkin' 'bout climbin' through the fuckin' window.
In the backseat, potato burners.
Ski mask, body bag, duct tape, and a pillow.
In the front solo.
Sittin' low with the lights out.
Feelin' like Manson on some Sonny Sam shit.
With a murder on my mind that my mind on the homicide,
And my watch said they outta time.
Somebody gotta die, bottom line.
Front page, column nine.
Headline: Another Columbine.
I plan and plot and strategized, and thought about it.
Loaded up everything in the closet.
My objective is to get bloody.
They can beg and plead, yell and scream.
Try to leave, get in cheese, pray to God on they knees, but I'm still gettin' fucking ugly.
I fuckin' love it.
Took this nigga by his throat and fuckin' cut it and thought nothin' of it.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)

[Verse 2: Game]
Last night, I must've had a blast choppin up bodies.
Woke up bloody as fuck in the hospital lobby.
Body filled with adrenaline.
Not rememberin what I did to get all this blood on my fuckin' Timberlands.
Cop's sayin I did what to him?
Showin me pictures of cut-up bitches, disfigured members with body parts missin.
Listen, I ain't do shit, I don't know shit.
Man, I don't give a fuck about that bitch.
Fuck whatever she said, fuck whatever she saw, it wasn't me.
Oh no no, not me.
Listen to the alibi.
I was at the movies, that Avatar shit,
With them 3-D glasses on,
And that shit longer than mother fucka.
Look at my pocket, get the tickets though.
That's my alibi, bitch.
Now what up?
Fresh out the cuffs, now I'm back on the outside,
And headed west where Homicide reside.
That's my nigga.
He live on 1st and 48th right next to the white chalk in between the yellow tape,
Behind the black gate.
Rottwielers and pitbulls, surrounded by snakes, AK's and AR's.
Some niggas hard to play, some niggas play hard
But that house right there, don't go in they yard
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
It's simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Man, I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)

[Verse 3: Game]
Beware of dark shit., shot 'em through the fence
Tough offensive line men couldn't stop the blitz.
Them niggas inside, a couple kittens
And this right here, good riddance.
Nigga fuck around, it's suicide for instance
Picture the mind of a bullet
Here I come I can smell the flesh aimin' for your head or neck.
Nigga, pray to God I won't hit your chest.
Now here I come straight outta drum, headed for your lungs.
You in my sight.
The last one didn't do it right,
And I'm waitin.
Just lookin at you.
Thinkin about it and gettin tired of lookin at you.
Hi, daddy, remember me?
Goodbye, daddy, this is what it gotta be.
You brought me in this world, now I'm takin you out.
Now you open up your muthafuckin mouth.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy.
Simple insanity.
Just a murderous fantasy of mine.
(Now I feel like killin me a mother fucka.)


[Verse 1: Game]
Holdin' my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley tryin' to find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof
Speakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem
Cause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still

Yeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin' like
This young nigga be killin' this shit
Hip-hop is life's ciroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga

[Break]
Stunna, whattup blood?
"Whattup blood? What's poppin' my nigga?
Look, I know this the last one after this it's straight Cash Money, my nigga
So, it's YMCMB, wild life my nigga, let's get it poppin'"
Rich game
[?] one hunnid
Suwoo

[Verse 2:]
New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggas'll do your bitch and bitch niggas'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a chu-chu
We puttin' on magnums, taggin' that wagon, some of these birds kookoo
And murder is what I do to
These Just Blazes, Kanyes, shit on Swizz, I handle my biz
The whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggas know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggas, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin' styles, niggas be tracin'
Whether it's me, the movie, or Jadakiss, niggas just can't fuck with Jayceon
So let's go

[Hook: Elijah Blake]
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad [?]
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free

[Verse 3: Game]
Wanna welcome everybody to Jesus Piece
After my album fades, my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun up here, [when?] I leave you niggas under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a ginsu
My album like a 'Rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this mufucka up and blow speakers

Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go

[Hook]

[Outro: Game]
And last but definitely not least
I wanna send a special shout out, to my nigga James Harden
Another Los Angeles nigga carrying rockets
Ballin' on you bitches


[Hook:]
Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do, reach you, praise you
Heaven's prays, all I'm wanna do, praise you, my lord

Nigga I ain't pastor mason yo, nigga patting rhyme, pete sirock acing y'all
And since I got good taste and all, this for all the bad bitches couldn't wait to get they braces off
I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinking, wrong
But inside the bible is the perfect way to sneak my phone
But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
And stare at all the women who brought they Louie purses in
Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
But you can't catch the holy ghost in the prius

[Hook:]
Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays

They look around the church like what that nigga looking here
He prolly told of somebody, posed to be doing years
But who am I to judge a nigga, hey I don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
But I love the nigga, so I'm a go for both us, and put these g stars slacks with these louie loafers
He rather sit outside and listen to hova
But the service jumping, the pastor is serving my mimosas
And all this ass in here, how do I focus
Collection plate buldging damn pastor you the coldest
My envelope stay swollen, so I'm a count my blessings now, somebody hold this

[Hook:]
Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run through ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays

Staring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
Ain't paying they ties, taking up 2 seats
And look at God's house, pack full of sinners
With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain't
And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
And I supposed ain't nobody a liar in here
If that was true, the whole chruch would be on fire in here
I'm so glad we have a choir in here, to wake me up everytime I get tired in here
And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the lord
Cause when I went to undefeated, they still have my force
Fell to the floor like

[Hook:]
Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
All the bad bitches, I'm a run throguh ya
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, damn, damn, damn, damn
Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do is, reach you, praise you
Heaven's prays, all I'm wanna do is, my lord


[Intro]

[Hook: Game]
Part the Red Sea in red Louboutins, who the don?
Walk inside the club with all his Gucci on, you've been warned
Packing heat like two LeBrons
And my crew is strong as Cali kush
It keep you (higher than heaven's arms)

[Verse 1: Game]
Gucci in my closet, pardon my head
Pardon my French, but I'm on my Nas shit, off with your head
Off with your bitch, she offered me head, I offered her dick
Slid my black card at the reception, now we off in the Ritz
I'm rolling this kush, she coughing and shit
Freak bitch named Jada love the LOX, I got her talkin' to Kiss
Got my hands behind my head, now she all in the splits
Dick must be good 'cause now she in Boston with bricks
Got a text on my iPhone, she caught with my shit
Off with a ten, she took it 'cause she's far from a snitch
Hold her mama and her daddy down, got a sister at Georgetown
Paying her tuition so she ain't gotta be strippin'
It's money so I ain't trippin', this bullshit get printed
Them banks get scoped out, black cars get rented
My Gucci suit tailored, my fade get tapered
You get sent to your maker, fuckin' around with my paper

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
Hard bottom Ferragamos, IQ too much for mediocre convo
I know a Farrakhan though, three-story condo
IPod shuffling between Common, Jay Electronica and Bono
Armado, the last words of Paul Castellano
Nothin' but endless paper and bitches for niggas I know
Smokin' Cheeba, feeding divas McDonald's
All the way in Milano, ashin' out Cohibas
Fuckin' in that blue Aventador, the nose like Gonzo
Let a bitch get a breather, then she back hittin' high notes
Throwin' Louis luggage at dealerships, fuck a car note
15's in everything, beating like Harpo
Rolling purple like Harpo, bitches by the car load
They wana see Prince, I'm pulling strings like Carlos
Santana, now we in Magic, Atlanta
Wipin' Ciroc off my Loubi's with my Gucci bandana

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Kanye with Kim now, I'm happy for that nigga
Disrespect him or his wifey, I'll slap you for that nigga
Grew up listenin' to Pac, now I'm rappin' for that nigga
My brother been dead 20 years, I'm trappin' for that nigga
God Flow like Pusha n'em, rose Phantom pushin' 'em
Splittin' Louisville Sluggers open, puttin' kush in 'em
Ain't forgot about the Twin Towers, I blame Bush for them
Obama can't speak on it 'cause the government's shushin' him
But that's my nigga though, still stackin' figures
So one day I'm top 5 and I can politic with Jigga though
I was just trying to Blueprint myself behind Jigga, though
And all them old disses, yo, bullshit, Thibodeau
He be where the Summer be, I be where the Winter go
Tomahawk the Bugatti, Florida State Seminole
I'm out here tryna win a penant though
Never thought I'd be legendary, but fuck it I'm in it so

[Hook]


[Hook]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, Iâm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water

[Verse 1]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
â92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezyâs drop got âem, couldnât afford âem you shot âem
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We donât pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
Return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of Jâs
The you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gonâ die for em, they better be some number 4â²s
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posinâ on my car cause

[Hook]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, Iâm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water

[Verse 2]
Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her lifeâs mission
Trynnaâ save her ass like trynnaâ save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynnaâ fuck, thatâs the reason you tip her
And all Iâm sayinâ is a watch and a gold chain
Canât make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, thatâs why her mouth wide
Openinâ up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workinâ 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellinâ pies
Switchinâ lanes in that Cutlass, rubbinâ her thighs while I drive
Reminiscinâ on the days I was rollinâ broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!

[Hook]
My Phantom so mean like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean, even my shoes are Christians, Iâm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans and fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water, holy water


[Hook: Game (Future)]
It's been a long damn time since a nigga sold dope
But if you put a brick right in front of me, I remember
Makin' sure they in the triple beam, I remember
Blow the fully auto magazine, I remember
(I done fucked so many bitches that I can't remember names
But if you put that pussy right up in my face, I remember
Drop that pussy down on the floor, I remember
The way she coppin' down on the floor, I remember)

[Verse 1: Game]
Pop the pussy, don't play with it
I don't care if Kanye hit it, I don't care if Jay hit it
I'm a eat it up and I'm a lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I'm whippin' work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don't remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin' out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda
Got a Nisha, got a Tanya
Met a Tishaun, met a Honda
And I eat her anaconda
Got condoms in that condo
Got kush breeded in Rondo
Still hit me up for that blow
You already know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Drop top 'Rari shit, I drove it like I stole it
The Lambo in the shop, told my bitch to Range Rove
Microwave broke, so a nigga had to stove it
Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it
I'm posted right now, posted in this Gucci link
7 dead, 30 mill, wonder what Kool G think
Quaters not half O's (I remember)
Now it's the middle of June, and it's snowing like December
If it get into the 'sacs in your hood, I could mend ya'
Ya' nigga talkin' reckless on your song, I'll revenge ya'
Pull up to the club in a Phantom, I had a vision
Break 'em all down on the hammer, end of vision

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Pop that pussy up in that hydraulics (what's that)
6 4, throw that brick inside a pot and cook it, whip it good though
Baking soda inside of her bowl, hey yo, watch me blow
Promethazine mixed with a Sprite, poor it foo'
Been sippin' syrup all night, and I get higher than a plane
Yeah I remember your pussy girl, but I don't know your name
I got diamonds hanging off, they can talk of the insane
Ever since I gave her that molly, man that girl ain't been the same
Better pop pussy for a real nigga
That's on the way, I'm a deal with ya
I'm a real boss, that real sauce
Don't try me bitch, I will floss
That's real talk, my top off, I'm throw it off
Homo that green no play golf
I hustle take no days off
(FUTURE)

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Game]
Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that beamer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip Hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain

[Hook: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece)

[Verse 2: Game]
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears something Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

[Hook: Game & Kanye West]

[Verse 3: Common]
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for my sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, raw Stacy delight
Can't deny my Jesus piece that's so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A combo she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

[Hook: Game & Kanye West]


[Hook: Pusha T & The Game]
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, ya' honor
Name Me King [x2]
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King [x2]

[Verse 1: Game]
Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king

[Hook: Pusha T & Game]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(YEAGHHHHH!) it's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe
He took the throne so I could run through (YEAGHHHHH!)

[Hook: Pusha T & Game]

[Verse 3: Game]
Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner

[Hook: Pusha T & Game]


[Verse 1: Game]
She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, MedellÃ­n
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, "Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent"
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev in there
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick the door in the room and told her to put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel, it's me
And I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door H.A.M
Then he bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me

[Break: JSMN & Game]
When I wake up every day
Even though she doubted me
I thank the lord that we are safe
Even though she doubted me
Again, yeah
Even though she doubted me
That's why we pray for me
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids girl
You can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me
Gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'
So let's

[Hook: Game & J Cole]
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head
(Pray) bow your head

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Cole
Good girl at heart I remember you well I remember you well
Got a husband and kid, but I flirt
Hope you do a little dirt cause I'm diggin' you still
That's real, but na you don't text back
And deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit, so
So I fall back, year go by I got more plaques
Just to call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back, damn
Well what changed then?
She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up
Hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what?
You ain't been home lately, you ain't heard that nigga
Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo she burned that nigga
She burned that nigga
Say what? She burned that nigga
Say what? She burned that nigga
Dog, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib
Then he went and did a bid all cause a bitch burned that nigga
Now dog, that's real ass shit
That's word around the ville ass shit
Get the strap up, get the strap up
Please tell me that you strapped up nigga
We could kill that bitch if you want to
I'm cool, I strapped up, played by the rules, damn
While I'm sittin' here blessed, she at the crib all alone and she stressed
So nigga I

[Hook: J Cole]

[Outro: JMSN]
When I wake up every day
I thank the lord that we are safe
Again, yeah
That's why we pray for me
When I wake up every day
I thank the lord that we are safe
Amen, ooo
That's why you should pray for me
That's why you should pray


[Hook:]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck fed now
Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
Another dead fucking body nigga

Gansters, this is how we roll
Jesus Piece, and it's out of gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost, and it's adios

Who the fuck scared now?
Who the fuck scared now?

[Verse 1:]
Chased that nigga down, put him on worldstar
Bitch nigga got away, in his girl's car
Put that pussy on the net like a pornstar
Another weenie with bread, he a corndog
Put 3 holes in his head, like a bowling ball
I'm out the gutter switching lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds, cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the murder dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the desert eagle and
I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn
Specialize in the murder game
Documentary shit, back to Hurricane
Now tell a nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat, I'll clap niggas
This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga
What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie dog?
I ain't no snitch but if I did it ain't no biggie dog
Cause that's Biggie dog
All that's coming out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as being 50's dog
But I got tired of being 50's dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebrating, label on my dick hard
Interscope asking "would I take 50's call"
Hello? Put up 10 mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas
G-Unit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All these niggas claiming they OG, my young boys will murder them
Cold shooters, that 16, and they ain't ever even heard of them
I slide through, I get a bird of them
And they drive through, and they serving them
These niggas talking that beef shit, I put bread on it, no burger bun
We walk up in this bitch like "what?"
Rollie on my wrist lights up
Told these niggas "can't do it like us"
Ciroc boy, and I do it like Puff
With 100 bottles, 100 models
No twitter, we come to follow
Straight shots and no Moscato
I fuck them hoes, don't give a fuck bout em
Now tell me who's scared now?
Shots fired, man down
Dead bodies get found
That chopper clip spits rounds
And real niggas get murdered
Top dogs get it first
He came to me in that Benz
And he left from here in a hearse
Woah!

[Hook]


[Verse 1: Game]
I don't read the XXL
Tote a 45 to church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cause niggas
Five shots to the head cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Momma's mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say it's a blessing when you die in ya sleep
Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capishe
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a caskets what he pray in, Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing bout her baby, you crazy

[Hook: Tank]
Such you see no evil
She gonna knock it at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sew
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a jag
A cut for my dogs with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when discouraged
Skirt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone
Shirt off when precesure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries even though I know it's an eye for an eye

[Hook: Tank]
Such you see no evil
She don't hear nothin at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?

[Bridge: Tank]
I was born a soldier
Ride or die for mine
Tied two tears and a lawyer
Tried to give me love
Heaven can you hear me? I know that hell can't
So heaven can you hear me?
I'm only just a maaaan... oooooooohhh

[Verse 3: Game]
You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Half City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up, plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can't hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 Dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother's prayers saved you niggas, I never wanted peace.
Los Angeles, I'm the motherfucking king here
No first 48 cause motherfuckers don't sing here

[Hook: Tank]
Such you see no evil
She don't hear nothin at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'm a see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then?
What happened then?


[Hook: Luu Breeze]
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know is that I'm stuck on this road
Of success so I got to get mine
All I know is this pain in this life
And this struggle it troubles me so
All I know All I know

[Verse 1:]
Red phantom, they say I look like Josh Smith from Atlanta
I do, hachoo, excuse you, that nigga look like me
He from the G.A., and I'm M easy, that's Game
I don't do what you niggas do, that's lame
I Soo Woo with my crew from the from the Burque
I Soo Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame
Livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Most other gang's, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off
I got some shit for that vest that will knock that bullshit off
Money like made off, killing like aid off, royal holiday
Hillel fucking Kay off, and I don't take a fucking day off...

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Cincinnati C hat, Boston B hat, them is me hats to the Philadelphia P hats
Believe that; bring it to the hood so you can see that
Dumb ass niggas like game, Where the keys at?
Automatic start, nigga where the trees at?
Red boned bitch like Alisha, where the keys at?
Freeze that, like a fucking picture
If you ain't a blood I ain't fucking with ya na I'm just fucking with ya
Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski masks on and get to straight fucking with ya
Ain't that some shit, that bustards sick
You wanna know how I'm livin' nigga ask your bitch
Told you precisely how to ask and sit, and she a nasty bitch
I came in her mouth ask her lips, you know why?
Cause I had to go past them lips, Crip
You probably paid for those ass and tits for...

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Fuck with the blood clock, smile for my mug shot
Can't go out like em but I love Big, I love Pac
Love Fab, love kiss that's where the love stops
Cause I sleep with the enemy and I hug blocks
Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me is fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I'm acting Ruth
Understand I'm tryna feed my people
Haiti just like Compton the way I'm packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will green bay packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the punt turn, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till 3-o-clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain't Talib, Black Though or Mos Def
But I've seen the most deaths
And nigga I'm just telling you


[Game:]
She leave her hair in the sink
She leave her hair on the floor
Her hair all over the bed, that make me love her more
She wear a scarf, Louis V the big sack
It's a wrap, messing up her wrap, blowing out her back
Never let another rat hit it from back or the front
On my mama nigga, I be gone for months
I come back

[Mario:]
And it's still tight, I like when it's real tight

[Game:]
I'm a lick in circles now...

[Mario:]
Tell me what that feel like

[Game:]
Feels like when you try them red bottoms on
It feels like the song cause we all the way gone...
Between me and you, do anything for old girl
Like hit it in the morning, yeah, cold world

[Mario:]
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
Sweeter than that
Tryna find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gonna keep on watching
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

[Wale:]
She call me all the time, I ain't no regular Joe
I be staying at the Roosevelt more than Marilyn goes
I met some bitches with Chuck, but I was wearing some foam
Shorty been fly forever, these bitch's parachutes broke
CC's is on her purse so I'm aware that she know
And you know the flow, they jack it, I'm apparently cold ya know
Life's limits is bitter, I need another fruit
She know we can't elope, look at what honey do
Straight G thing, double M G thing
Weed, they can't fuck wit em puffin AC green
When I peep in the public, bet I'm leaving with something
And I'm so fly I make some homebodies liable to love it
Shout out diamond supply
Shout out Bobby on hundreds
Not too many is touching
Double M G this summer
The RED album, little red shortie, you can't touch him
I know Mario's on the hook, but I was playing Duck Hunt

[Mario:]
Baby you're the one
You ain't gotta hit the club no more
Sweeter than that
Tryna find the one
But you been looking for love in all the wrong places
Every day's a movie, girl, you make the scene
They gonna keep on watching
We gonna be all the way gone
We gonna be all the way gone

[Game:]
Yeah, he blowing up your cell phone
Send him the voice mail cause we all the way gone
And you ain't doing nothing wrong
But killing the competition in that Cosabella thong
Turn to the side, let me see them thighs
Profile, man I'm digging your style, we can start slow now
Then speed it up, this playing in the background
While I beat it up - I beat it up...

[Mario:]
Baby soon as we get home, it won't take us too long
We gonna make it to the bedroom, I like the guest room
You can pick the next room
Put the camera on the tripod, got me playing on your iPod
I know you feeling me on my job: Director

[Game:]
Cut!


[Verse 1:]
All you bitches is Nicki Minaj sons
So get her a trash bag so she can pick up her ones
She bend down I see her tracks
I make it rain she throw it back
And all this money keep me and pussy, no Kat Stacks
But I got racks on racks on racks
Pool side at the W, take a puff and relax
It's that millionaire lifestyle, Audemar iced out
Order more spades then hit 'em with that lifestyle
But these fakes hoes won't leave me alone
Fake bag, fake ass and she beggin' for patron
My credit Meagan Good, my money Nia Long
And them heels you got on, pound sign

[Hook:]
Basic bitch
I got a bitch with me, she got a bitch with her
And I ain't talkin' 'bout no basic bitch
BeyoncÃ©, laced front on
Who you trying to front on? And stunt on?
You just a basic bitch, she got a fake Louie
Fake Loubie's [Christian Louboutin Red Bottoms], fake booty
So she a basic bitch
At the club all weekend, she trying to get rich
But all I got is this dick for a basic bitch

[Verse 2:]
So knock it off with your knock-off
You give head to any nigga riding with his top off
You the type I'd knock off, forget I ever met you
Block you on Twitter, never BBM or text you
Lookin' for the next you, I just wanted to sex you
Hit you on the D-Low, I'm Cee-Lo, F you
'Cause every time I'm up in the club looking for hoes
Everything look good off a couple bottles of rose
Down low with your swag, stuntin' off of your toes
And paintin' a mental picture of you without all your clothes
Have you ever fucked a millionaire in the back of a Rolls?
With Amber Rose? I ain't talking 'bout no

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I can tell by your avatar, you never had caviar
Your friends can't go, you can't go, you don't have a car
But that weave hanging down to your ass
Bitch ain't from Dallas, but she rooting for the Mav's
You a bandwagon ho for sure
You up in every video takin' off your clothes
I thought I told you that you wouldn't get far
Melyssa Ford did, seen her in Choclair, now that Honda Accord is,
A 2012 range, now look how times change
You bitches'll never get a ring, LeBron James
'Cause I got all the game, used to move Danity Kane
Gettin' dirty money with my little

[Hook]


[Verse 1: The Game]
I was born in the crosshairs without a pot to piss in
Where niggas get smoked over their Jordans and their Pippens
Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York
But life is a bitch out here: word to Too $hort
Wack as a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc
Gang banging had us addicted like it was Newports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter homie, named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
The Game still in Cali eating off The Documentary
Take em to the cemetry I mean the cemetary
Where everybody boxed down: Refrigerator Perry

[Hook:]
And everybody fuck up and blame it on Barack
Cause he's just like T.I...: Born in the Trap
And everybody fuck up and blame it on Barack
Cause he's just like Gucci: Born in the Trap
And everybody fuck up and blame it on Barack
Cause he's just like Jeezy: Born in the Trap
And every little fuck up, my gun she go "crack! "
Cause I'm just like Outkast, born in the Trap

[Verse 2: The Game]
So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swag no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest cause she in her mid-40s
And your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties
Cause they running around like they was your age
Fucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS
Yeah, 2050 on these niggas
Golddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you
But it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the cherry Niks
Now I live a married life, walking in the house
To the home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills

[Hook:]
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Just like Goodie Mob, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But just like Luda, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap
Niggas still got their hands out, begging for a stack
Take em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap

[Verse 3: The Game]
Shit deeper than the roof's bent
15â²s drumming, Questlove in the coup fam
Riding through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin
We out the hood, tryna get money like?
Splitting backboards just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, let's fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed to the bahamas and breathe
On the way back, to my nigga Sean from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president
I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant
And campaign with Wyclef while he run for president

Told you I was gonna kill this shit, Primo


[Verse 1: Game]
I'm at the house bout to roll this kush up
I can get a call at any minute, so I'm just doing push-ups
Waiting on what seems to be forever
I burned a hole in my Polo sweater cause I was nervous
That's how crazy birth is, loading up this Beretta
Cause this time I'm having a baby girl
So it's whatever, whenever... whatever
You my willow and it's my will to make this last forever
First thing I'm a tell her? Daddy's your umbrella
Get with a glass slipper Cali, you my Cinderella
Gotta be a dream, hold up, that's your middle name!
Both your brothers big now, so baby you my little Game
Who gonna be the Godfather? Lil Wayne?
Y'all smoke too much but got Cali tatted on his veins
And I just got a text from your mama
Saying the water burst, I guess it's time for my comma...

[Verse 2: Game]
You walk through the door, she on the ground crying
She don't wanna get up, you had a baby right here
I ain't cleaning that shit up!
I finally got her out the house, now we on the elevator
She screaming, her left the car seat
But I'm a tell her later
Forget the car seat - man - I'm hella-faded
She like "I know you ain't high! " Man, I'm celebrating...
Now we in the car, she won't put on her seatbelt
Screaming at the top of her lungs: "I need help! "
Weaving through traffic, minutes between contractions
Close your eyes right now, and you can see it happening
Imagine: she pulling on me "stop I'm about to crash, shit! "
Butterflies in my stomach, heart beating fast as shit
Every time I have a kid, it's like the first time
Kids the best, but they be coming at the worst times
Now we here, Tiff get in the wheelchair
Butterflies still here - am I happy? Hell yeah!

[Verse 3: Game]
I parked the car, now I'm running through the halls lost
Trying to figure out which one of these rooms is ours
Think: damn... one of the nurses stuck her head out
They gave her an epideral so I pulled the couch bed out
Took a nap, woke up, they almost got the head out
She grabbing on the rails, looking like she about to pass out
Told her to breathe, grab my phone and hit record
"Breathe! 1, 2, 3, 4 - one more - 1, 2, 3, 4"
Push! C'mon Tea, push! God damn it, just push! "
Nurse coaching her, doctor pulling on shoulders
Giving me the notion to cut the umbilical
She out, 8 pounds 4 ounces
Hold up: I'm about to make an announcement
See, every time a child is born somebody leave the world
So I thank the woman who gave her life for my baby girl


[Dr. Dre:]
His parents hustled
So he was left alone by himself a lot
So shit, he did whatever the fuck he wanted to do
When boys in the hood came out, this little nigga rolled himself a joint
And watched the whole motherfucker by itself
His pops didn't give a fuck, but his mom found out?
Shit, she'd kill him and his dad
She didn't want him seeing, being or getting caught up in no gangsta shit
So she never knew, until now


[Dr. Dre:]
In Compton, you either a blood or a crip
Nigga ain't no one in between
Shit was a hard decision for him to make, cause both his parents was crips
His Uncle Greg was a crip, he died when he was 5
His brother Jevon, he got murdered when he was just 13
After that he decided that being a crip just wasn't for him
So he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
And never looked back


[Dr. Dre:]
His moms and pops met in Compton
His pops was a Nutty Blocc Compton Crip
Moms was from South Central, she claimed Hoover
They had the lil nigga in 1979 at Martin Luther King hospital
And if you know anything about Killa King, you know this:
Being born there is just like dying there


[Dr. Dre:]
This nigga been shot, but you already know that
He went to jail recently and Monster Kody taught him
"This ain't no place for you, you see bein' locked up 24 hours a day
That shit ain't gangsta, you see bein' outside takin' care of your family
That's the most gangsta shit a nigga could ever do"
He said "The shit ideal for takin' em out the hood
Givin' em a chance to be some motherfuckin' body
Now that shit was gangsta"


[Game]
Since BIG ain't here, Iâmma do it for Tâyanna
And put roses on the grave for Kanyeâs mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, gettinâ beat on by their man
Respect women, I donât care if they a 2 or a 10
We donât beat on Kat Stacks we just bring it to an end
And we donât wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
Thereâs missinâ women out there, letâs just focus on them

This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her Daddy, so I wrote this on Fathers Day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar âYe
Iâm about to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back, listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my chronic out and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way
When police came our way, my daddy had his act on
Like it never happened: (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga, she ainât gotta deal witâ ya
You want some money? Nigga I ain't get a deal witâ ya
You ain't sayinâ nothinâ, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air cause
You coulda went out, like ya boy Steve McNair

[Hook]
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
Donât make the good girls go bad, no (I, wont)
If you don't, you gonâ really love us (I said I wont)
Please donât use us, dooonât

[Drake]
Good evening, Iâm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models, but hmmâ¦ I donât believe âem
Whoâs still gettinâ tested?
Wheres all the women at, could still remember who they slept with?
Whereâs all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list?
But when you do go out, you still working with what you was blessed with
Do it girl, Iâll be your King, be a Queen Latifah
I love ya ass like Milhouse love Lisa
I love ya ass like the ninja turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of
You got it girl, this song remind me of Kat from Philly
A girl I used to love but still she started acting silly
Her hearts a lilâ chilly, she a little too carefree
In 10 years, whoâs paying for all that therapy
Umm, nigga not me!
Yeah, Iâm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When Iâm done with bad bitches Iâm coming straight to you
Good girl

[Hook]
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gonâ really love us
Please donât use us, dooonât

[Game - Verse 3]
Drizzy, Iâm sittin here watchinâ Basketball Wives
Like ugh, them is basketball wives?
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes chick
Canât swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first day
Or pop a bottle with her on her birthday
And tell her ass, get on
That type of shitâll get you spit on
I donât hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like âhey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy worldâ
âGet busy girl, drink that Rose til you dizzy girlâ
She walking round the club all lost like âwhere is he, girl?â
He on the top of the charts next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Dom spray
That's your girl, nigga go on make her cry
Soon as you do, Iâm pulling up in that Porsche, like âLets rideâ

[Hook]
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Donât make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gonâ really love us
Please donât use us, dooonât

[Game - Outro]
Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And that's my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy
Surrounded by them diamonds, Imma cold mackin
Nigga its a cold climate, donât ask me where the crime went
Just tell me where them dimes went
So I can get em fitted, let em beat a bridesmaid at the wedding for my niggas
Yeah Iâm married to the game
And she married to my chain, watching Boys In The Hood
Lets take a drive down memory lane.


[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know we got em
45s, machine guns, heavy artillery
We got those grenades on your ass, nigga
Boss. Black Wall Street
I'm in that bulletproof Maybach nigga (Teflon Don)
S Case

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Nigga talking like a G but walking like a broad
I pull up at the light, pineapple in your car
Nigga I shatter lives, my music camouflage
My court killers at the center of my synagogue
Torch in hand, extortion to the Fortune 500
From the porches to the Porsches with the wides on it
'Fore you snitches bitches, you better put your lives on it
Get you twisted by the [?] with them wires on it
I get my money smoking spliffs like it's Friday
I'm sitting sideways like I'm in my driveway
My champagne kicks, my shit 3 wheels
You niggas six feet, we getting 3 meals

[Hook:]
They got jumped
45s, machine guns, and heavy artillery

[Verse 2: Game]
Yeah I got 2 gun charges, 2 felonies, just got off probation
Today motherfucker, won't budge for no charge
Real nigga, I hold no grudge with no thugs
Come through spraying, bullets out the McLaren
They ain't meant for you, so move bitch, you hard of hearing?
I speed off doing 90 with Tha Carter blaring
Bust shots in the Cavalier like I ball with Baron
Yeah I Blake Griff niggas, make stiff niggas
Eminem wasn't Dr. Dre's only sick nigga
Insane in the membrane like Soul Assassins
12 gauge stop a nigga heart like a bowl of Aspirin
I hold automatics, let your man hold the casket
Murder game cold as Aspen, body found in the trash bin
First 48, they don't find me, case closed
Like a rehabilitation spot in Bobby Brown nose
Take em back to Boyz in da Hood when I pull the pump out
Something like C-Murder on Worldstar when I dump out

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Siegel]
Ain't nothing changed but them bullets in my clip
I still pull it, still bully niggas on the strip
Beef, I cook it fully with the fifth
And I ain't got no pets, I put a bullet in ya bitch
A nigga with a gun in his hand who won't bust it?
Like a bitch with a dick in her hand who won't suck it
This is the art of war, you niggas just drawing
Anything I target on is dearly departed, gone
Drive by or walk up on -
I just stop, breathe, aim cock squeeze
Silencer on the Glock, infrared beam
Put your block up on machines while the pussies run and scream

[Hook]


[Lloyd:]
Let's ride...

[Hook: Lloyd]
You ain't gotta say bye bye, baby this is hello
Put your hands in the sky, that's where we gonna go
I like you so I gotta put a ring on that
You the one that I wanna put everything on that
Let's go, baby this is hello

[Verse 1: Game]
She used to wake up to The View
Now she wake up with a view
Used to wake up to a kiss
Now she wake up to a shoe
Used to dream about millions
Now she working with a few
Used to know one Porsche, now she know two
I'll handbags stuck to her like glue
Minks and chinchillas, whole closet like a zoo
Agent Provocateur, Louis and lots of Dior
All her friends wearing Gucci so she don't rock it no more
Every time we in Jimmy Choo, they gotta lock up the store
Walk out with boxes galore
Next week she cop her some more
Alexander McQueen cause she my queen
Spent an Aston Martin on the ring...

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Verse 2: Game]
Soon as them butterfly doors go up on the Ferrari
She step outside the car on there, stumble into Bulgari
Fall in that YSL, try it on, you fly as hell
Don't really like it, but I'm buying it: might as well
Have her own reality show: no drama
Grab your girl, we're shooting real housewives in the Bahamas
2-piece Hermes, Bottega Veneta flats
Heard Diddy out here so you know where the party at
We on... and I ain't even gotta ask twice
Cause when we hit the room she up and down like the gas price - damn!
Got chills thinking of last night
I swear you was a goddess in your past life

[Hook: Lloyd]

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Girl I know you wanna get away
This hotel room, that's where it goes down
And I know we never get away
Just give me a couple minutes and I'm in it
We all over the table, ain't no problem with you sweating on me
And I ain't pulling out, I'm tryna have fun
I know you tryna have fun...


[Chorus]
I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

If I say we on one muthafucker we on
If I say we gon' my nigga then we gon'
And I say we drinkin' then we drinkin' that Patron
And if I say we rollin' then somebody rollin' zone

Ay-yeh-yeeeeh

[Verse 1]
This shit right here nigga
How you smokin', how you chokin'
how you chokin' while you rollin' I be zonin'
In the morning wake and bake'n while I'm yawnin'
It's that get lo, Benz-o, be careful around them rims hoe
run and tell your friends that we 'bout to get it in
And we smokin' on this endo
Let it breath crack a window
blowing on this purple in this Enzo

[Chorus]
Nigga I'm the King
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

I'm the king
And I be smokin'
Welcome to my town
And I be smokin'

If I say we on one nigga then we on
If I say we gon' my nigga then we gon'
And I say we drinkin' then we drinkin' that Patron
And if I say we rollin' then somebody rollin' zone

Ay-yeh-yeeeeh

[Verse 2]
What you smokin' can't fuck with the shit that I be blazin'
Walk in the store, eyes so low they probably think I'm asian
Red bone, red car, aint this bitch amazing
red hot, red bottoms, spicy like she cajun
red rims, red cuts lookin' like a st-a-ar
tell a nigga ballin' by the emblem on his ca-a-ar
so fa-a-ar, so go-o-ood
this is what they call me in the ho-o-ood

[Chorus]

You smokin', who got the flame?
Gettin high as them Chevy doors when I'm rolling up paper planes
I'm just sayin', wipe ya feet off before you step in the door
Been bangin' since '94, you didn't but now you know
Them bitches hittin' the flo'
Then switches hittin' the flo'
Them swishes is good to go
And that pruple off in ya throat, so, yo
You ain't know this is how we ride
And we can take this nigga outside
Recognize

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Zoned up, 'troned up
this is what you want
Bottles up, lighters up
This some shit to smoke to
Zoned up, 'troned up
this is what you want
Bottles up, lighters up
This some shit to smoke to
I'm the King!


[Verse 1: Game]
Mama told me stay away from them niggas
Mama told me she had a K for them niggas
Mama told me she go to pay for them niggas
While my grandmother told me that she would pray for them niggas
They just young black and ignorant
Lusting over models and the Benjamins
Got the game twisted like (what?) licorice
When I was rocking lottos moving packs in front of McDonalds
She was looking for me, pulled up in that Old El Dorado
I was running around with Chase, chasing new black wheels
Why would I do that still? That's what got 2Pac killed...
But I use that still cause I won't do that deal
Screw the muzzle in potatoes of that new Mac Mill
What did I learn? Nothing
My papa smoking sherm blunts and
Beating on my moms like her head was a percussion
Tat! Tat! My.45 knocking on your window
She said there would be days like this, Pharrell, drop the instrumental

[Pharrell:]
Yezzir...

[Hook: Nelly Furtado]
I know I must go and I don't know my way
Still don't know where we all came from

[Verse 2: Game]
Crack a Swisher, crack a 5th up
Hennessy pouring like Niagara Falls
Used to watch Magic, he showed me how to ball
Moms working late night, to get a plate right
Had some older brothers, all we did was smoke and play-fight
Wish I could go back to them days cause streets don't play right
Some niggas hard, other niggas was the Kid N Play type
Didn't stop me from pretending I was Apollo from Rocky
Working on my dip-game, now nobody wanna box me
Pick and choose, stick and move
So many dudes ended up in sleeping bags on late-night news
But not my mama's song, going around the hood serving customers
She yapping in my ear, but it's louder than the muffler
What I didn't listen to, I wish I would've trusted her
Wish I had a shovel, be digging both of my brothers up
Like "here hug em ma, one last time"
Put a chain on both of them niggas, they get one last shine

[Hook: Nelly Furtado]

[Verse 3: Game]
Put your block down, recognize a king cause it's my town
Word to my mother you can throw up your rock now
Got off the beef shit cause I ain't tryna see my mama in all-black
Right there, crying over hard facts
Now she gotta turn in all her cars and get her house back
Never! She carried me for 9 months so she can have whatever
Plus she taught me how to shoot Berettas, told me that I'd be a king
So RIP to Coretta, if you don't understand that
Then refer to my letter, while I sprinkle
Niggas with platinum, from my last album
Got the check, so I signed on the X like Malcolm
Riding through the hood, you hating niggas like "how come? "
That niggas Game got it, heard he selling talcum
Either way, hey playboy, check it, this is the outcome
You might not like it, but my mama psychic
Why you niggas twisted like the top of a Sidekick?


[Verse 1: Game]
Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire and drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook.. and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanco on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy!

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)
Muthafuckin Martian (to a goddamn Goblin)
We are not the same, I am a Martian

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolfgang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
I do cause Tunechi always bless me
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking her pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delante West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy

[Hook]


[Hook: Young Jeezy]
2 niggas down, 2 niggas run it
Call me snowman, 100 miles and gunning
Here come the paramedics!
It goes 1 for the money, 2 for the dough
All you got is 3 niggas kicking at your door
Here come the paramedics!
It goes 1 for the ghetto, 2 niggas run it
Call me snowman, 100 miles and gunning
Here come the paramedics!

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Here come the pain! I've got a name
Ever since an adolescent I've been deep in the game
All I need is more weed, a little something for the pain
So good like a hook from T-Pain
They say you're nobody til somebody kills you
I say "go be somebody, even if it kills you... "
They say "death smells like bad ass weave"
Another watch, another chain: last thing a nigga needs
I swear to God, a couple right by the night stand
Clip my half a hundred, case another hundred grand
And get some rest when your conscious keep waking ya
The evil kicks in and them demons start shaking ya
Every night, dude, I wake up in a cold sweat
Get dressed and hit the club in a cold vest
God damn, girl, you so sexy, cold shit
But why they still riding to your old shit?
Party by the beat, all still riding with ya
Party by the big riders, still siding with ya
Party by the real niggas still hustling to ya
I know you're here in the day, ain't nothing to ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Game]
See us riding like some mobsters, with the trunk full of choppers
Give a nigga a couple shots, and I ain't talking about vodka
Hanging out the sunroof, Snowman driving
Nigga live through these shots: Put his ass on Survivor!
Fresh up at the trap, I ain't never been a rat
Get cheese like a mouse, so I'm honest throwing stack
Let you suckers make it rain, I'll make it Katrina
And pile all them hoes in the back of my Beemer
Hit the freeway, bumping "Ghetto Boys", with the V12 steaming
Top down, in the rain, California dreaming
I'd be lying if I said I still flip birds
... Well nigga I still flip birds!
Word to the doors on this [?] I'm sitting on
Ain't a rapper alive me and Jeezy ain't shitting on
Who else you know shit out Benjamins, and piss Patron?
Put Michael Buffer between us, and let's get it on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
(Hey Snowman, these niggas hustling backwards
I'm a pull the K out, and turn em back around)
Look, if I give you half a chicken, can you break that bitch down?
Tell the truth, it's me nigga, ain't nobody else around
Jeezy said it's a recession, so we hustling that Mayweather
My [?] the best pound for pound, like Mayweather
Undisputed: I never lost a brick
UPS, FedEx and duct tape to a bitch
Put her ass on that greyhound
Tell that ho to stay down
Sleep the first 48, and wake up in the A-Town
Give a fuck about a bitch
Die for the paper, hustle relentless
Nigga, I take the sky from a scraper
The Gerber out a baby mouth, the fire out of Satan's house
These rappers turned saints, we pull them fucking gauges out
Black Tims kicking in the door, at your lady house
He at the strip club, well fuck it, we gon wait it out
You tipped him off, so now all the K's is out
We [?], shot him down from the neighbor's house

[Hook]


[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.

[Verse 1:]
There's a mother out there right now,
About to have the next LeBron,
Searchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun,
They say death comes in threes, whose next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time,
Now I'm on a quest to find peace,
Still gotta carry my piece and soo-woo when it's reppin' time,
Ya'll don't understand, I'm misunderstood,
Give Interscope 2 more albums then Iâm done for good,
Sold 10 million records ain't leave the hood,
It's a cold world everybody need a hood,
And everybody doin' time stay headstrong,
You still gotta chance to live,
Even though you're dead wrong.

[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa)
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes I try to do good but I just can't be,
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me,
And ya'll should thank me,
But my haters busy tryna send me home early but you can't New Orleans Saint me.
I ain't a saint B, I ain't a god God,
I ain't an angel neither but I try hard ya'll,
I'm lightin' up for all my soldiers at war,
As I sit back and watch the ashes on my cigar fall,
Wayne just came home, and tip back on the yard dog,
Guess Pujols ain't the only one playinâ hard ball.

[Chorus:]
All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.

[Chris Brown:]
See the thing about all of us is
You never know just what we bout

All the spotlight is not for me,
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home,
I miss the days when life was simple,
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow,
In search of the pot of gold (whoa whoa),
In search of the pot of gold.


[Game - Verse 1]
Throw your motherfucking Cincinnati hats in the sky
Nigga don't ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max '95's
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man 'Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin' switches to the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it, nah forget it, SuWoo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don't live in Judah's eyes
Half of these rappers weren't trappin' when I was choppin' the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma "won't you decide"
She chose Doc, first day I pulled dude aside like its Aftermath for life
And all I do is ride
Before I turn on 'em I kill Satan and stick my red flag in the ground
It's Red Nation!!!

[Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gonna fuck the World til that bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm no where to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Game - Verse 2]
Niggas'll trade their soul to be Drake or J. Cole
Live and die for this shit, word to Tupac Shakur's halo
One blood, plural, nigga I'm spendin' Euro's
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I'm up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin' stupid
Get thrown in the back woods
Los Angeles, home of the scandalous
Pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas
Nigga we rollin' cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I'm Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That's my Chi-lingo, yeah I'm bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

[Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gonna fuck the World til the bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Lookin' in the mirror, I know where to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground

[Game - Verse 3]
Russia got a Red Flag
US got Red Stripes
Last train to Paris, round the World in these red Nikes
Che Guevara of the New Era, test me
Louieville slugger, you'll get buried in my new era
Got that natty on, tighter than a magnum
Walk in the club saggin' with a .38 magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin' on a hill like Lauren
Her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at?
Roll up the weed son, so many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I'm out here, I might as well go shopping
And put this new bad bitch I got her some red bottoms
And all these hatin' ass niggas want me dead
Cause I'm Malcolm X before he turned Muslim, RED

[Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Everyday's a gamble motherfucker, tough luck
And we gonna fuck the World til the bitch bust nuts
I can't tell ya whats good, but I can tell ya whats, what
And that's, B's up, hoes down
Lookin' in the mirror, I know where to be found
Blood, I'm a dog, call me a blood hound
Throwin' blood in the air, leave blood on the ground


[Intro: Boyz in the Hood]
"Shit! Rick!
C'mon man! "

"Ricky! "
"Help me! Help me! Somebody, help me! "
"Ricky, Ricky! "
"Ricky! "

[Verse 1:]
Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom
But standin' in the window caine smoking was the outcome
Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice about my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling "Ricky! "
My nostalgia is one hundred percent Compton and zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks while I use the bitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear...

[Verse 2:]
Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about, was that the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing, like Sinatra, I told the detective
Get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five shots created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz in the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life "Ricky! "
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, I swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim
Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what killed her, I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran and defend all my niggas
With they faith under stockings, rather face God then 25 with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground
This how my living room sound, when my brother got shot down...

[Sample from Boyz in the Hood: Crying]


[Game:]
It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit
Straight West Coasting, you can tell by my outfit
Red 'nati fitted, "Blood in, Blood out" shit
Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit
The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit
Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit
Dippin' the 4 though, double X 3-D Polo
If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin logo
Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine
I've been hard since I was solo
Niggas feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers
Go against the grain, and put your shit back like some clippers
I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin
You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting
I mash out the strip then like Nas when I'm dippin
Feeling like God's Son, the way that It Was Written

[Hook:]
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
Cause I got another ounce up in the stash
Them boys want they music on blast
Don't turn me down, turn me up every time them cops pass
Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask
Cause I take 2 hits, and then I pass

[Game:]
I see the cops in the rearview, why can't a motherfucker chill in the car
Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill
They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill
Camouflage by the Armor All while it's sparkling off my wheels
And I fuck hoes that pray on Dwight Howard and Shaquille
Not them throwback rats they be on showin' college hill
For real, I think my first album sold 5 mil'
And you say to yourself "He's broke"
Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding
I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling
Can't get to the phone right now cause balls is all in this bitch mouth
When did we start taking these tricks out?
Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend
You had her all up in the wind
Blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuitton, and now that bitch is in the wind
And after the next draft, she gon' start that cycle again
How you claimin' that bitch when she with him?
Come again cause

[Hook]

[Big Boi:]
Daddy Fat Sax, my balls are on your chin, but can you tell me where my dick's at?
Come order ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat
I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, I'm the lightning that strikes twice
Motherfucker, call me mass of, cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses
If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, we facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin'
You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation
My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform
Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone
Like gears, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Story and club songs
Boy, gone, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home
But I feel like a librarian, cause style's are being' loaned out like books
A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage
They'll do anything for money, I bet misleading the village

[Hook]

[E-40:]
Not from New England, but I pack a patriot
Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater
Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear
I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider
I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker
Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter
I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler
You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers
But I used to flee through that yellow white
Sellin' that shit below the retail price
I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right
Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite
I got my red cup, and some green
What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream
My nigga let my hit that there hemp, do your thing
How many woofers in your trunk? 4 15s

[Hook]


See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city
See any angels in the city

[Game:]
Tell them motherfuckers I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in the Everglades
Drive up out that motherfuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' rÃ©sumÃ©
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole: I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smoking that chronic just to meditate
I'mma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me shit, I was selling weight
Now a nigga's selling millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performing in front of millions, nigga, every race
6'4" in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate
But I'm not stopping 'til I'm the fucking king in every state

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with Cartwright, 'cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building
Let it tow behind me tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me!

[Game:]
I'm sick of motherfuckers talking about "the West died"
Can't you hear my heart beating?
That's the motherfuckin' West Side, you test me, you test God
I'm his son, it says in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have time to run, I'm from the Compton slums
And that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where 2 of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list nigga, top 5
Game, Biggie, Hov, probably Pac, Nas
No particular order, bet a mil' that I slaughter
Serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered
How dare you niggas pop fly when I'm the nigga
Sold 5 mil' out the gate and numbers do not lie

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with Cartwright, 'cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building
Let it tow behind me tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me!

[Game:]
I gave you The Documentary, shit was a classic
Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waiting for
I'm the lost angel knocking on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you 'cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you like "What's going on baby boy?"
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy, or the black Slim Shady, or
could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen - no disrespect to Calvin

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burning when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
get familiar with Cartwright, 'cause I want that shot, I'm a raging bull
When the needle drops. For the record, I'mma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'mma tie a knot on a downtown building
Let it tow behind me tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga fuck your feelings
This is me,

Kendrick, and I wear a pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant, and the coupe tinted
Got pulled over, Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac in his prime
Thug life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dick-riding, I'm addicted to
West-siding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit, now everybody sing that shit


Yo you can keep asking them fuckin questions all fuckin day man
I told you what- I told you what the fuck happened man
Told your partner the same thing man, how long a nigga gotta stay here?

[Verse 1]
There was money on the table with the bricks
I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
Heard my car alarm goin off on my 6
So my dogs start barkin and some niggas hit the fence
So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
You niggas ain't doin shit, but stealin my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rolling with..
Nah I ain't shit and I ain't snitching on nobody
Yea that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
And 2 dead niggas? Them is nobody..
They should've torched em, and you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
Man fuck this shit I thought I told y'all
There was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin up some shit
Listenin to Jeezy and I heard a little (speeding car)
So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4 Fif, oh shit..
Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4 Fif
Seen some niggas jump in they escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this muthafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke but shit y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this muthafucka until I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
Cus it'll be a cold day in Miami
Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
Ya I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas run around the hood singin.. They should get a Grammy
And you two muthafuckas should get an Oscar
With this good cop bad cop shit.. Take me to process
Cus I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years
No evidence, no big. I don't know who split them niggas' wigs
Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin to bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin, there's some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 Fif
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store..


[Intro:]
The young Roy Jones in the rap shit
Somebody bout to get knocked the fuck out tonight man

[Verse 1:]
Niggas think they got The Game sold
Yeah right I'm air tight
Fresh in them Air Nikes
If the navvy outside
I might be there
Black hoodie, black nine, black white v Airs
Like Caddy trunks keep a spare
You see the lump under the ice berg fleece and yeah
And when the beef cooks I'm a put the piece through your hair
And if you see a white truck that mean the sheets is there
Then I'm goin goin back back to the block
To dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggas know I'm good with the glock
They call me chick herns cause The Game or not I'm calling the shots
I wear a shiny suite 4 em and they like them alot
They get gangsta with a SWAT me bag and a Jordan box
So when I die, bury me with the glock and a bucket of shells
In case niggas want drama in Hell

[Chorus:]
I'll give you anything you ask for
Money over bitches!
Tell me what you blast for
We don't fuck around with snitches!
What you have the smash for
This bitch tried to play me man!
Anything you ask for
It's all about the bank Game!
[Repeat twice]

[Verse 2:]
First things first
Money over bitches
Swore say my name in vain watch main
Brake the bones in your nose
I'm a flick time rida
Inner city flipper
Watch who try to flip more like their neighbors want digger
Sergeant at arms who playin, I'm a General
So draw your fire arms when you in the presence of criminals
And motherfuckers subliminal metaphors or adjectives
I come to where you live and send 60 rounds inside your crib!
Killer by instinct
Murderer by nature
Killer Cali earth quakes ya
Ain't nothin but bone brakers
Is nothin like puffin on this justall ass pound
Became in my turner
Have your mouth twisted just like Bobby Brown
Fuck what you might of read
Fuck what your people said
Back in this bitch and o 6 is The Game in lead
Highly anticipated the day has finally came
I slap a patch of meat off a nigga head for Game
Fer real!

[Chorus x2]


Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Y'all niggas see me when I'm come through and ain't no denyin'
That them big motherfuckers is twenty five
Swayin' in and out of white line, six double 0
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin' like the streets is mine

Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman-Ali combined
Any beef, I'm releasin' mine
And I won't stop bustin' 'til them Escalade seats recline

The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein' sorry, it ain't nuttin' but a gangsta party

And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin'
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin' to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong, nigga

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Trust me, dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
That'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggaz thinkin' I retired my Chucks, put the gun back in the holsters
'Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster

But that don't stop the heater from bangin' or me comin' through
Droppin' all y'all niggas with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin', one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder

Dog, we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains

And the coroner's real good with the pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleanin', they can get the rest of that shit up
'Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggas next to each other how I do 'em in line

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook, then I'm bringin' the chrome
If I die, then I'm leavin' a clone, but if I live
Through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig

When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin' on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin' on the block
And when I'm loadin' up them clips, I listen to 'Pac

A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
Than F A B O L O U S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey

And ain't nuttin' to do a drive-by in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke? Bet the S-5 pink on it

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you

Real niggas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggas sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply 'cause I'm mad at you


Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, 'cause niggaz tryin' to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
Could run up on ya on any corner

Put somethin' on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6 with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin' for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee

'Cause I play for the Bucks and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back like Jordan in charge

I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
'Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin' the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
Of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

It's Telly and young Game, the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin'
Yale or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet, I'll come back with 10K in the drop

I'll stay in the spot, wearin' a crop and coppin' ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

And you don't want it when the stainless out
What the game about, the bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg

So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards
And y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president

Steppin' out of Chevies with heat that's heavy, that's president
Bullets flyin' for them dead guys, that's president
Lead meltin' inside your wig, that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin', it's all president


[Jamie Foxx]
Ohhh-ohhhhh yeah

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
I know you're sick and tired of waitin on me girl
But I'm, just tryin to get my money right
So let some dumb nigga take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed-out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)

[The Game]
She like black Bentley Coupes, black Day-tons
Black interior, black ridin shotgun
Black fo'-five, black Air Ones
Bangin "The Black Album," track #1
She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite
If it's gon' get me the pussy I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard, I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marques Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got halfway through watchin "Ray" I hit
I laid it down beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what
The it's part two, in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin Mary J. cause she don't want, +No Drama+
I'd rather take yo' ass to the Bahamas
Then give you 30 thousand a month like Diddy baby mama

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Picture me thuggin, picture me lovin you
like Bobby love Whitney now picture me fuckin
Pullin your ponytail smackin you on the ass
Tellin you how (I can take you all around the world)
That nigga can't do it like this
Even Beyonce couldn't move it like this
She only fuck with +Soldiers+, that's her shit
I hate to admit it but I love my bitch
So much, I'm sittin outside in the Benz
Thinkin back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin; now I'm dealin
with +The Diary of a Mad Black Woman+ with Louis Vuitton luggage
She told me she was tired of The Game and rap
Quit like Ma$e then she came right back
I told you the bitch sex was wack
And you're all I need, even Jamie know that

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[The Game]
You know what they say, more money more problems more drama
means more marijuana and less baby mama
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force Ones come in twos
Yeah, I like her, and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley Coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you your Burkin bags, so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book?
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talkin 'bout buyin a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[Jamie Foxx]
Around the world with me yeah
Around the world with me, ayy
Around the world with me, hey
Mmm, ohh


[Chorus]
[K:] You got them funny ass colors on, take it off

[D:] I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
[K:] What?
[D:] Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on

[The Game]
Gettin' my bang on, red strings on
Luis Vuitton kicks, Luis Vuitton frames on
Luis Vuitton belt holdin' the fo'-five
You know who I am bitch, I'm Mr. Westside

[Daz]
This West West or nothin' - get your pistols, get your flag
Gangstas we love to sag, we cock it back and blast
Like booyaka-booyaka, we lay the party down
G-G-Game, Dogg Pound

[The Game]
Everybody get down

[Kurupt]
Look nigga... I nurture and breed

And bitch niggaz try to invade our town
I'ma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out

[The Game]
Say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down - now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'ma Crip Walk to get Dre
and Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (like that?) like that

[Chorus]

[G:] If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
[D:] I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off

[Daz]
We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic
When I did it I must admit it, so nigga go and rep it
Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode
Lil' niggaz with pistols that blowin' out your asshole
Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in
Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison
Real niggaz for life, the roots of the G tree
N.W.A., Dr. D-R-E

[The Game]
We not S-T-A-R's, we don't put stars in our shoes
Bitch we put the whole car on the shoes
You don't wanna see my car on the news
I'll "Set It Off" like Queen Latifah, red beam on the nina

[Kurupt]
Bang out, chippin' in traffic, dippin' the classic
Dippin' to classics, whoopin' that ass
It's hood niggaz ready to get it, your bitch can get it
Cause I know she'll suck a dick in less than a minute
Cuz, I'ma have to show him where the house at
Two milli macks, semi-automatic situational attack
In the back with a sack, Cadillac all black
Like this and like that
Bang, broken like glass and plastic
Bang out on him with the mask and plastic
We got access to massive plastiques
Purchased last week, D.P.G.C.
Bang

[Chorus]
[K:] You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
[G:] If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
[D:] I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
[K:] What?
[D:] Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on

[The Game (Kurupt)]
Here come them outta town niggaz, what up Blood?
(What up cuz? They don't even know what 2Pac first album was)
Should I tell 'em Blood?  (Nah, fuck 'em loc)
Me and Kurupt three-wheelin' on the hundred spokes

Run up on the '6-4, see the AK's
(Bang) like Eazy, (Bang) like Dre
(Bang) like Snoop, (Bang) in L.A.
(Bang) like Crips and Bloods
From now on, wear a Bathing Ape hoodie get stripped in the club
Like a bitch in the club, watch him strip in the club
You like ice creams? Get a banana split in the club
No jewelry, you can't wear shit in the club
And that go for every nigga and bitch in the club
So you better take it off 'fore you get in the club
Game and Dogg Pound along side sittin' on dubs
Remember that

[Chorus]
[K:] You got them funny ass colors on, take it off
[G:] If you in the club with ice on we takin' off
[D:] I thought you was a gangsta nigga, you better shake it off
[K:] What?
[D:] Sh-Sh-Shake it off, or get banged on


[Verse 1- The Game]
Get a blunt, roll the weed, light it up nigga,
Sipping on Gin and Juice fill up your cups nigga,
The Westcoast back crackin' like it's 94',
So bitch get on your knees and give me head like it's 94',
And don't come up for air 'til the beat drop,
I'm the Doctors Advocate call it a sneak peak,

And let the world know the west is ridin' again,
I Graduated from Dre's school top of my class,
Treat my switches like my bitches got me dropping that ass,
Still bangin' the chronic like doggiestyle came with it,
And I roll a sticky on my bitch back while I hit it,
I done been there, done that, had beefs and won that,
5 million records on 1 plaque I hung that,
Still got Dr. Dre low ridin' in the 64',
When you see us, throw it up for the fukin' Westcoast.

[Chorus]
My heart beat for the Westcoast,
We pull the best weed in the Westcoast,
We low ridin' in the Westcoast,
So im'a die for the mudafukn Westcoast.

All the time neph' I gotta let my nuts hang,
A chest full of chains a left han' wit' a pinky ring,

My lil' hood rat, baby got that mini mack,
Baby got that 20 sack, baby got plenty that,
Whatever you send it's my nugga, we gonna send it back

And we don't give a fuck about none of ya'll,
And when you hit the city, you better holla at the Big Dogg,
I done seen niggas hit LA and get dey chain snatched,
Then they call me up, beggin' me to get dey chain back,
What I look like the mudafukin Police,
It's certain rules you got to follow, when you in these streets,
Especially when it comes to this Cali shit,
And I ain't talkin' bout hangin' in the valley Bitch,
Gang bang niggas all up in the alley Crip,
On some real talk nigga we the real Westcoast.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Xzibit]
Damn, I heard blue rag niggas ain't fucking with the red rag niggas,
On the Westcoast (Fuck you mean),

Black wallstreet and X-o-leen,
Since jealousy breeds hatred, hatred breeds violence,
Violence breeds enemies more permanent silence,
California alliance, is more important than ever so throw it up,
We low ridin' together (YEAH!)
Make the Westcoast rise forever, esse's B's and C's represent your letter,
Got Game the go getter, Xzibit the rhyme spitter, Snoop Dogg the boss,

{"Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie! Gangsta boogie.."}
Nigga nigga nigga I'm from

[Chorus]
(Compton, Compton, Compton)
It's the home of America's gangsta rap
The place of danger where
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
Where the cops is crooked, and them bitches is killin
And them niggaz hold it down like black guerillas, where
The {"Gangsta boogie"}, the {"gangsta boogie!"}
The {"Gangsta boogie"} - nigga nigga nigga I'm from (Compton)

[The Game]
Yeah, The Game on fire, check the gold wires
Hip-Hop on lock like some muh'fuckin pliers
Me and Will.I.Am yeah we take niggaz higher
Niggaz talkin shit get your fuckin mouth wired
Walkin through Compton, Eazy still alive
Raider hat to the back throw your dubs in the sky
My flowetry wicked, sit back while I kick it
And do it like Dre did it, N.W.A. did it
I cook crack like the first nigga that ever bought a brick
from a ese, nigga I could write an essay
About all the gangsta niggaz that I seen lowridin
In they Che-vys with a bitch ridin shotgun reppin L.A.
Crips, Bloods, homes goin loco
My glock to me, is like Ice Cube and Yo-Yo
Sittin in a low-low, on chrome spinners
Nobody drop nuttin this winter, nigga I'm from

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Nigga I smoke chronic, ain't shit changed
since Young MC and Eazy-E was rappin, "We All in the Same Gang"
Some niggaz chain hang, other niggaz gangbang
I do both cause I'm the king of the motherfuckin West coast
Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggaz say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowin on indo
Niggaz try to play me get stretched out like a limo
I was shoppin crack when Dre was bangin my demo
And all you old niggaz is washed up like N.O.
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence Will bang the instrumental
.. I spit for my niggaz in the line-up
that'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up
First album sold 'em out, Impalas rolled 'em out
Cause the whole motherfuckin world wanna know about

[Chorus - 2X]

[The Game]
Welcome to the city of G's
Where we eat fried chicken, rice, and black-eyed peas
Fans got us in-the-scope/Interscope, like Jimmy Iovine
Cause we (Ruthless), like Will before the (Black Eyed Peas)
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hirin
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retirin
I just might put out "Detox" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
Fortyfive in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, glock 17 quick draw nigga
Like the old me, 17, sippin malt liquor
All black khaki suit, all black Converse
Nigga I'ma keep on stompin comin (Straight Outta)

[Chorus - 2X]


[Intro:]

Now where's the shit?

Knee deep in shit!

[Chorus: (The Game)]

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)

Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)

[Verse 1:]

I let the whole world know that I can't be stopped,
Even without Doc I'm still from the (Streets of Compton),
Yeah ***** I said it, and I'ma stay on top,
Like a hoodrat with bomb ass cock,
Run up in 'em like these rap *****z, I ain't gotta clap *****z,
End your career with one line like that *****z,
Hit the switch front and back, make it bounce,
Let it jump, Killa-for-ni-a is where I'm from,
3 wheelin' with the ass out, smoke chronic 'til I pass out,
All the way to my ***** Daz house,
He always gotta big bad bitch from Long Beach,
She a known freak and she gotta long reach,
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it, never back down,
'specially when Al Green in the background,
Now bitch hit the weed and turn that ass round,
It's time to bring back Chronic into Doggystyle,
Westcoast *****z still holdin' shit down,

[Chorus: (The Game)]

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,

Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)

[Verse 2:]

I'm back on the cover of the Source and the XXL,
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton),
I got more bitches, more plaques, more beef, and more straps,
That's what the fuck I call "Gangsta rap",
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turn enemies,
Streets kept me laced like bloods dipped in hennesse,
You *****z act like the Game can't roll 'em out,
One man show still sell a motherfucker out,
We know Dre still sell a motherfucker out,
'cus everybody here from the (Streets of Compton),
We got crip *****z, blood *****z, assays, asians,
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces,
I kept you *****z waiting had to take you back to the basics,
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daitons,
Everytime your bitch hear my voice she masturbating,
I run though hoes like Walter Payton on the daily,
I got your main bitch swallowing my babies,

[Chorus: (The Game)]

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton
(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)

I'm the Westcoast Rakim, got you *****z blocked in,
Glass house parked sideways on the stock rims,
New school, old school mentality,
Translation - Four pumps and twelve batteries,
Hydraulics make the world go round,
Your girl go down, chronic make your girl slow down,
For she end up like superhead, giving superhead,
Every ***** in the industry now fuck superhead,
And I might just fuck her too,
If I ever catch her sliding or riding through the (Streets of Compton),
Rolling down Green Leaf smoking on that green leaf,
With a Mac 10 like I was born on Queen's Street,
Murder MCs like I was born in Queen's Bridge,
That how I show you palm *****z where the King is,
And you don't wanna play chess on a time clock,
I'm in the Hall Of Fame next to Snoop, behind 'Pac,
I got the whole motherfucking world locked,

[Chorus: (The Game)]

I'm a G, you can't see me,
That must be, why you're talkin' (Shut your mouth bitch)
I'm the shit, and you know,
It, never stops, there's no stoppin' (It don't stop *****z)
Light a lo', blow a smoke, oh,
As I cruise, streets of Compton

(Roll out the six fo, six trey, glass house, '57 Chevelot, tell them *****z)

[Outro:]

Everybody wanna know what the fuck is going on,
Am I signed to Aftermath? Interscope? What's up with Geffen?
I'ma just say it like this:
One day I walked in the motherfuckin' house,
And all my shit was gone.


[The Game]
Yo Bus, I think I got.... the answer to all my problems...
[Busta Rhymes]
The fuck you talkin' bout, n***a, what's that?
[The Game]
Belevedere... and Banana Snapple [hiccoughs]
[Busta Rhymes]
Look.... get your fuckin' ass up, n***a, you over here trippin' on yourself, n***a, you get in the fuckin' car, man, we gotta bounce, nig!
[The Game]
I'm a man... and most of these n***as, they don't know how to be a man... I got a son...
[Busta Rhymes]
The fuck you talkin about, n***a, come on, n***a, let's take yo' ass to the crib, n***a, you tired, n***a. And put the drink down, n***a! We gotta go, n***a!
[The Game]
One more shot....

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like la, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, la, la, la...

[The Game]
[Verse 1]
Dre, I didn't mean to turn my back on you,
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do, what he gotta do,
Remember, I'm from Compton too,
I saw you and Eazy in 'em so I started wearing Khaki suits,
I was 12, smoking chronic, in '92,
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you,
I made a choice, now it's be Crip, or be Piru,
Whatever I was, I was banging Gin and Juice,
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop,
Now I gotta keep it gangsta cuz it's in my roots,
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you,
I tried to think of what the fuck, Eminem might do.
If every n***a hated him, for that black bitch track,
And n***as stopped bumping Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped,
When Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like la, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, la, la, la...

[The Game]
[Verse 2]
I never said thank you, and I took it for granted,
You let me in your house and made me a part of your family,
Now I'm eating with you, Eve and Busta Rhymes,
I wasn't star-struck, I was just glad to be signed,
And even though sometimes I run loose,
You still my homeboy, Doc, I'd take a bullet for you,
I'm not asking you to take my side in the beef,
But you told me it was okay to say 'Fuck the police!',
Now it's my turn to carry the torch,
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover o' The Source,
Remember when we got drunk to do Start From Scratch?
I told you you was like a father to me, I meant that!
Sitting here looking at my platinum plaques,
Thinking 'What the fuck am I without a Dr. Dre track?'
When Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like la, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, la, la, la...

[Busta Rhymes]
[Verse 3]
See when the world is on your shoulders, and the stress grows bigger,
The fire in him made it difficult to talk to the n***a,
Most of the time I let him know, I don't agree with what he do,
But he a hard-head, Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you,
See when I first met my n***a, son was laying in the cut,
Type reserved, homie was quiet and kept his mouth shut,
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut,
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck,
And as time went on, and he was working with the finest,
I saw the pressure start to build so I gave additional guidance,
You gave him something that could make or break a n***a you should face it,
So big I don't even think he was ready to embrace it,
With the potential to be a strong n***a with conviction,
The only problem was our little n***a wouln't listen,
But when Doc say it's a wrap, it's a rap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nuttin' after that!

[Chorus]
I didn't mean to walk away,
But I hear every word they say,
I guess my mind just drew a blank,
Like La, la, la....
Now I'm sitting in this goddamn cage,
Reminiscing about my day,
Wit' your blood all over my slate,
As the devil says, La, la, la...

[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyo, Game... Aiyo Game! Wake up, n***a!
[The Game]
I'm up man, I'm up...

[The Game]
Just goin to the studio...
[Busta Rhymes]
[Laughing] Go to sleep, n***a...

[8 Bar Verses]


You Got's To Chill

I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm Chillin' [8x]

[The Game:]
Guess who's bizzack No it ain't hypno
L.A. Dodger fitted cap with the brim low
Blowin' on endo Roll down yo window
Matter fact let the top back and watch the wind blow
Black on black lamborghini with the dizzor
Up in the air with the pedal on the flizzor
Bandana tied around the rear view mirror
Red bandana got 'em bangin' new era
Something on my waist niggas can't get near us
Bitches 'round me shakin ass like Shakira
Niggas poppin' Chrystal everytime they hear us
I stay on niggas mind like a new era

[Chorus:]
G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N to the T to the S to the T to the O to the muthafuckin P
That means I'm Chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm Chillin' [8x]

[The Game:]
Doing my two step Red strings on my louis
I don't know how to dance so don't step on my louis
Bitches on the dance floor bouncin' like a pornstar
Legs in the air like the doors on a foreign car
Post it up the bar everybody strizzap
Double GAME chains hanging down to my lizzap
Every nigga in my click stay iced out
Reach for a chain,red beam, turn your lights out
Shut the club down, The Game don't stop

In the parking lot, lemon lime patron shots
Looking for Ciara heard about the goodies 
Hurricanes in a BlackWallStreet Hoodie

[Chorus:]
G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N to the T to the S to the T to the O to the muthafuckin P
That means I'm Chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm Chillin' [8x]

[The Game:]
Everybody know when The Game in the clizzub
20 impalas outside on the dizzubs
Everything chrome from the rims to the strizzads
Panties gettin' wet everytime they see 'em lift ups
So hop in the back seat if you're a freak
Three wheel motion got 'em sliddin' on they seat
8 0 8 drums got 'em griddin' to the beat
Turn high beams on bring the club to the streets
If you jump off niggas know what I'm about
Million dollar man bring the drama to yo house
Hommies outside, Wearing that ass out
I'm gettin' a lap dance, Smoking chronic on your couch

[Chorus:]
G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N to the T to the S to the T to the O to the muthafuckin P
That means I'm Chillin'
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm Chillin' [8x]

Rollin' in the car
Coolin' in the tub
Drinkin' at the bar 

G to the A to the M to the E to the D to the O to the N to the T to the S to the T to the O to the muthafuckin P
That means I'm Chillin'


Dre, I see dead people

Blood, Blood, Blood, Blood-Blood-Blood [x3]

Yo, Dre
Thought I was Dead
West coast

One blood [x4]

[Verse 1]
I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead, that's why they call him the doctor
The (after)'math don't drop them
And 50 ain't rockin' with him
No more, IT'S OKAY, I get it poppin'
Whole club rockin'
Like a '64 impala
Drink Cris, throw it up
Call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup
Call the shit hypnotic
I bleed Compton
Spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit
But new niggas
Bathing Ape shoe niggas
I'm talkin' to you, nigga
Bouncin' in the '64 throwin' up West side, man
Sellin' another 5 million albums, YES I AM
Fresh like damn
This nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim
Inside the lambo (rghini) in the shotgun with Snoop
What would the motherfuckin' West coast be without one crip and (one Blood)

[Chorus]
One blood [x4]
Blood, Blood, Blood, Blood-Blood-Blood [x3]
One blood [x4]

[Verse 2]
I'm from the West side of the '64 Impala
Where niggas say "Where you from" we'll never say "Holla"
Bandanna on the right side
Gun on the left side
Niggas in New York, know how to throw up the West side
Word to Eazy
I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathin'
All i need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said the West coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep tryin' me
Everybody knows I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gonna turn down the .38 snub?
You 38 and you still rappin' uh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer
Hop out with no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you see is (one Blood)

[Chorus]
One blood [x4]
Blood, Blood, Blood, Blood-Blood-Blood [x3]
One blood [x4]

[Verse 3]
I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you gettin' head in the 6-tray?
And the double game chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A (aftermath)
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A (aftermath)
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snappin' your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas keep talkin' about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle, holdin' the glock
No beam, no silencer, I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil' Jon come on and left off a shot
I have the number 1 billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm BIG, I'm Cube, I'm NaS, I'm 'Pac
This ain't shit but a warnin' 'til my album drop

[Chorus]
One blood [x4]
Blood, Blood, Blood, Blood-Blood-Blood [x3]
One blood [x8]
Blood, Blood, Blood, Blood-Blood-Blood [x3]
One blood [x4]


[Verse 1]
Pull the rag off the six-fo',
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go,
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone,
The D's is chrome, the frame is black.
(So watch it lift up)
Till the motherfucker bounce and break,
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate.
Let the games begin,
These other rap niggas so far behind me, go taste my rims,
Shit, let the chronic burn as the datens spin.
It ain't been this much drama since I first heard Eminem,
In the club, poppin' X pills like M & Ms,
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend.
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round,
And put that cheap-ass hypnotic down.
(Put your 'cris up!)
If you feel the same way,
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

[Hook]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,
(If I could fit the whole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash,
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me where the drinks at,
Where the bitches at,
You fucking on the first night, meet me in the back.
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks,
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protÃ©gÃ© of the D R E,
You take a picture with him, and you gotta fuck me,
And you gotta fuck Busta, can't touch Eve,
Got something in my waist that you can't touch either,
That's - my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods,
I'm in the club on some gangsta shit.
(So nigga twist up)
Light another dub,
Bitches get scared when niggas start fighting in the club.
Ain't nothing but a g-thing, baby it's a g-thing,
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string,
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week,
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat.

[Hook]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,
(If I could fit the whole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash,
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

[Verse 3]
Niggas thought I wasn't coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo' with the motherfucking top down,
I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre
You passed me the torch, I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray,
Ridin' three-wheel motion 'till the ass scrapes,
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race.
Now watch it bounce,
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down.
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me,
(We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P.
It's a new day, and if you ever knew Dre,
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre.
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke.

[Hook]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back,
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass,
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash,
In a blunt, call it Aftermath


[Chorus: sung by Tracey Nelson]
Walkin down the street, in my All Stars
In my, khaki suit, doin what (I) do
Walkin down the street, smokin, chronic
In my black locs, lookin, (AT) you

[The Game]
Guess who's back on the West coast tracks
It's the motherfuckin messiah of gangsta rap
Still dip in the six-fo', still puffin on the same chronic
Haters mad cause I still got it
I never fall off, even without the Doc
You niggaz sellin your soul tryin to stay on top
Bitch nigga check your Kotex, you niggaz ain't movin shit
like the hand on a fake-ass Rolex
I'm five million sold, the cover of my last album
the only time you see me sittin on gold
I'm the most anticipated, most celebrated
Most loved and the motherfuckin most hated
Keep rollin like gold Daytons
Niggaz got the game fucked up like Hennessy with a Coke chaser
You gotta deal with me, I'm the West coast saviour
Niggaz think of me everytime they six-fo' scraper

[Mac Minister]
What do you call a nigga who's overbearin
Belligerent, foul, defiant and very disrespectful
You call that nigga the Doctor's Advocate
He's a reflection of Dr. Dre in his heyday in the worst way
The five star surgeon general
Took Jayceon to the Aftermath research department
And gave him a blood test
It came back G-A-M-E positive
The nigga's infected with the Game virus
His oratorical skills are so impeccable
That niggaz in the streets call him Cyrus
The young don who is down with violence
cause in his heart he's a tyrant
It's not a game, it's just called The Game
There'll be no referees, no halftime reports
When the game is over, The Game is over
You can't put a quarter in the machine and get three mo' men
THAT'S, the end

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I done been to hell and back
Left for dead, you know who to thank for that
Finished my second LP without a Dr. Dre track
You can take my soul but can't take my plaques
I'm the motherfuckin snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggaz
get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwin back Patron shots in some creased up dickies
I'm D.O.C. certified, Ice Cube (Lynch'd) me
Snoop stamped me and the good Doc handpicked me
You still with me? Me and my mic
can't be seperated like Interscope and - hahaha
Ohhh shit
This some good ass motherfuckin weed
California sticky green!
This is the aftermath for the Aftermath
West, coast!


[Chorus]
Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)
Ridin' by gettin' high
Smokin' on that chronic drinkin' Ol' English
Rags tied gangs signs Letters on my hat in
Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)
Drive by homicide
R.I.P. tats in Ol' English Westside 'til I die
Niggas pourin' out that Ol' English (la-lala-la-la-la-la)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in the projects yo
I watched my uncle Greg put D's on his six-fo'
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Shopped crack and watched "Colors" and I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40-ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my pops flashed the 'Vette
'Til one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Block they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga wit' a Black Panther tat
Kill a nigga cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older I would understand that
It's blood in blood out and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13 that's when I had my first

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I was the first nigga wit' a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and let the motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40-ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard so I stole my brother's glock
And that's the day my life changed 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that Chronic from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40-ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my Adidas
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society
But I never left fingerprints on my

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a lot of dead homies some blood some crip
This is life stop watchin' that "Boyz N The Hood" shit
You see this red rag hangin' out of my jeans?
I went to twenty funerals by the age of nineteen
Then I went to college basketball was my dream
Quit the team 'cause I rather shoot rock wit' the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to trun a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac thought I was rich bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin' 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in

[Chorus]

Ol' English [x4]


[Chorus: Andrea Martin]
I only fuck with you, on two occasions
When I'm drunk, when I'm high
I would be broke, if I would be with you
That is why it's for one night

[The Game]
I'm a motherfucking gangbangin nightmare, wake up motherfuckers
I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a rare pair of Converse, back to the hood
My own niggas acting like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I showed niggas the Bentley then let you drive it
Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sittin on the block, reminiscing for hours
Wiping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fucking with niggas, after I got shot
and didn't get one hospital visit
My homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this
It hurt my heart, to say this shit

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[The Game]
Red bandanna in my back pocket, I'm for real
This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells, I ain't get
one keep your head up, all I got was keep it real
Keep it real my niggas?
Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas
After the bullshit, I stayed right there
Took you to award shows, there go J right there
Where? Right there! I had all you niggas in suits
Cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last twelve months been a fucking nightmare

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[The Game]
This shit worse than arguing with my bitch
I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch
Get yo' hand out my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang with you?
Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Paru
And the reality is, I could die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you
We can both ride, angels flying over my head
Stoned but the devils inside yo' box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life
I should've took Dr. Dre's advice

[Chorus w/ ad libs]

[Outro - Andrea Martin]
Black Wall Street for life
Only fuck with you on two occasions
When I'm out of my mind, or when I'm high
I only, fuck with you...


[The Game]
As my, Daytons spin, lowrider sittin low
Hittin corners so hard you can taste my rims
Rag top six-fo', Henny in the passenger side
Smokin chronic just (Let Me Ride)
You would do it if my name was Dre, second comin motherfucker
Throw it up for the king of L.A.
I'm known for makin bitches take they clothes off
Long as I'm from Compton, California I could never go soft
I'm hard as a motherfuckin ounce of raw
Dribble rock like Kobe Bryant bounce the ball
Fuck the law!! Feedin my son is a must
Whip it soft, whip it hard, in crack we trust
Why Andrew Jackson look high as fuck on the 20, G answer
Cocaine been around for centuries
Since I'm young, black and rich, I'm the (Public Enemy)
Ridin the bass drum, Just Blaze got the (Remedy)

[Chorus]
[scratched:] "Now they got me in a cell" - Chuck D
I got the remedy
[scratched:] "Now they got me in a cell" - Chuck D
Aftermath got the remedy
[scratched:] "Now they got me in a cell" - Chuck D
Nigga back up (back up) back up (back up)
'Fore you get your punk-ass smoked

[The Game]
I ain't no joke G, so don't provoke me
I'm from the city of angels where that Jacob watch is a trophy
And starin at that Hollywood sign'll get you straight jacked
(Where you from fool?) Better say you pro-black
Causin walkin in Roscoe's wit'cha chain hangin
is like Giuliani tryin to get rid of the gangbaners
Now that 'Pac passed, tryin to put us on Death Row
Get ready for the Aftermath
I run through the city like Godzilla
Doin mo' damage than Ice-T when he dropped (Cop Killer)
Pull a shotty out the trunk of the Chevy
There go another victim of a one-eight-seven
Who's the grim reaper wit'cha life in his hand
Even the toughest niggaz run when my gun go... blam
So kick back and watch the bitches dance 
N.W.A. is back, now let me see your motherfuckin hands

[Chorus] 

[The Game]
I'm back by popular demand and so
All black interior on the cherry red six-fo'
Niggaz endin they careers tryin to shut me up 
Actin like I traded in my khakis for a button up
The West Coast still dippin
Game still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin
So what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana
tied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke
They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke
Shit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes
Three wheelin through the neighborhood
System on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass
The key to drivebys is aim steady 
Turn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti
When you cross that enemy line
Close your eyes, (Parental Discretion Iz Advised)


[Swizz Beatz] 
Yeah... y'all really want this to happen? (Game time!)
C'mon! ... ARRRRRRRRGH!

[The Game]
Homey it's hard not to kill niggaz; it's like a full time job
not to pull out the steel and shove it in your grill
Young California got that mass appeal
I summons the hood, they get up in yo' ass for real
Knockout flow, Winky Wright jab for real
And all you niggaz pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, my flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin six-fo'
Your bitch know, hop in the back when you see Swizz hoe
Diss that, all you niggaz get up off my dick so
I can cook crack on the track and watch it mix slow
Cocaine, my flow fire, call it propane 
Every nigga know Game, five shots no pain
And that's the reason why I'm shittin on you niggaz
Shut me in the looney bin, I'm sicker than you niggaz

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
(ARRRRRRRRGH!)
This is that disrespectful, motherfuckin West coast
Hip-hop death blow, Swizz Beatz, let's go!

[The Game]
Where I'm from, I seen the most stand up niggaz lay down
Where skinny niggaz make buff niggaz victims of that trey-pound
And gangbangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West coast niggaz is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggaz, make money with the smartest niggaz
I ain't got time for you fuckin artist niggaz
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin sargeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggaz on the runway
(Boyz N The Hood) 'til they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin back out, cause I'm the rap Stackhouse
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crackhouse, what?

[Chorus]

[The Game]
My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggaz let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean... mean... rappin machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin the buildin, don't make me run in the buildin
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin
Walkin past offices I see my son in the buildin
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin
They should build me an office up under the buildin
My elevator goin down, I am done in the buildin nigga

[Chorus]

[Swizz Beatz]
We in the motherfuckin buildin man
You ain't got your motherfuckin mind right?
You gon' get your mind blown out your motherfuckin mind right nigga
It is what the fuck it is man
How y'all wanna cut the cake?
You touch this you get your hands cut off, nigga
Swizz Beatz the motherfuckin monster
Game is in the motherfuckin buildin
We could turn this whole motherfuckin world red nigga
Bitch!


[The Game]
I'm from the old hood, somethin like yo' hood
Where niggaz don't know good, or know Suge, but the blow good
So we rock it like Tracy McGrady
Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80's
So that mean, me Kanyeezy and Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian
I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans
I'm a artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and 'Pac departed
Nate ridin with me, Snoop ridin with me
All you other niggaz used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump
like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

[Chorus One: The Game]
Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump

[Chorus Two: Nate Dogg]
You look like you mad as fuck, but who cares?
Grabbin her by the arm, cause she stare
Don't know how much atten-tion you pay
You better be ready to die, in this game

[The Game]
I thought I told y'all
I'm done with the beef clown, my son three now
And I've been watchin Dre so long I'm makin beats now
Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-Town, fuck it it can go down
Nigga I spit the whole round, fo' plus fo'-pound
Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown
And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig
I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again
Put my head on the barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie
I'm alive, so I'ma take a Patron shot for Tookie
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin the movie
Inspired by this gangbangin shit since I was two
I brought the West coast back, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

[Chorus One + Chorus Two]

[The Game]
Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin windows down, let the bass out
Niggaz - drop the top on whatever in
Bitches - let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome fo'-five under my hood
So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin they chain
Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight, read this at my wake
I gave 'em "The Documentary" and they scraped the plate
Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face
I can not, will not ever be replaced
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man

[Chorus One + Chorus Two]

[Nate Dogg]
He wolfin a lot of shit, he look scared
You can't find your girl, she right here
I'm not a bad dream, I'm a nightmare
'Sides there's way too many hoes in here


[Nas:]
Y'all know what it is...
The streets named me Illmatic, for that I'm still at it..
Can't hate us....
Fellas...

Vice behind me on the intersection,
Sex and drugs, my anthology on perfection,
Dress superb, admired by conspirers,
Who wanna try me, but ain't high enough to four-five me up,
Child of the eighties, y'all niggas is lazy,
Complain about labour pains, nigga show me the baby,
And my nigga Game, light another L, pass the bottle,
Pro-black, I don't take cotton out of aspirin bottles,
Yeah, I learnt my lessons, and heard y'all snitchin',
Witnessin' you rockin' [?] with Nas, confirmed my suspicion,
Green fatigues on, My niggas I bleed for 'em,
I can show 'em the water, but can't make 'em drink it,
And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich,
And still I don't abort 'em [?] when and if they sink quick,
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge,
And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live...
(8 Bars... kind of)

[The Game:]
I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze....

'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin',
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin',
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening.
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole,
Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble,
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo',
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle,
I rekindled the flame,
Dre created The Game,
nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came,
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain.
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted,
I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it,
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it.
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, Nigga
(8 Bars)
Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me,
How you gon' pass the dutchie [?] to them niggas that don't love me,
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top,
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not,
I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins,
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains.
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers,
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career,
The ending of yours, the endin of his,
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz,
N*gga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line,
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines,
And I still think about my nigga from time to time,
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind,
But I just hold back cuz we ain't beefin like that,
He aint Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin off rap.
One love.
(8 Bars)
I'll do Marsha's bit if you want, but it seems kinda pointless.
I thought Nas was on point with his multis, the cotton line is a bit old though.


[Intro: samples from "I'd Find You Anywhere"]
For you baby, I'd find you [4X]
You wouldn't get far

[The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerrera, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brains you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cock
Picture that like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Putting oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez
She was (Eye Candy) in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she {"wouldn't get far"} cause five hundred dollars
can't get you that {"far"} how you get that {"far"}
And all these new video bitches trying to be Melissa Ford
But they don't know Melissa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards
Ha ha

[Chorus: The Game]
{"You wouldn't get far"} Fucking them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
{"You wouldn't get far"} If you kept your legs closed
{"It would be just a waste of time"} But you know
{"You wouldn't get far"} Fucking them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
{"For you baby, I'd find you"} For you
And you, for alla y'all

[Kanye West]
For you... uhh..

Pop quiz, how many topless, black foxes
did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two, nigga that's mad nuts
Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
bitches knowing damn well they gon' call me?
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches coming at me fo'?
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio
Yo

[Chorus - sub "mouth closed" for "legs closed"]

[The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short doo like Kalissa, Halle in "Boomerang" yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fucking with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody trying to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggaz do when pussy sitting on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Takara
And she ain't win the show but she riding in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

[Chorus]

[The Game]
God damn! Y'knahmsayin?
I'm sitting back watching Kanye video
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checking out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same BITCH, that was in my video! Y'knowhatI'msayin?
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watching Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah, floating away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video!
I mean DAMN! Everywhere I look
Everywhere I go I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only being real
Yeah


[Verse 1 - Rick Ross:]
I got a house on my face, custom made glasses
Laser on heckler, ashes to ashes, valet to vessel
Known as an Aston, the Hoes give you ass, homie, only in my absence
Well connected with gang member on most sets
Not to boast but get you popped like moet
My record sales could never reflect my respect
What god damn Def Jam forever in debt
Money bags back and forth how carry it on
Tattoo dead homies on my arms, still I grieve for 'em
As I'm nailed to the crucifix, tears in my eyes, smiling on the inside (Blessed)
Nobody cares what I feel like, no
Now it's six xanax just to feel right, let's go
Periognom in my glasses, toast to competition
Ashed to ashes

[Hook - The Game:]
See the fireworks in the club, you know we got bottles
See the lambos out front, that tells you we fuckin' models
Spit real nigga shit, so you can bump it in the phantom
Make it rain for them niggas who ain't never seen Atlanta
Red diamonds in the watch, red frames in the lenses
How you know you on?, Baby mama driving Benzes
Louis Vuiton house shoes, somewhere on the boat
Like a snitch nigga body, let this motherfucker float

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
Champagne in my glass feeling like a boss
Fell in love with a phantom, like fuck what it cost
Louis duffle full of hundreds, dimes of the purple, keep it G, cause that's me
These rap niggas Steve Urkel, survival of the fittest
Swimming in the dark, Sea World in my living room, Come and feed the sharks
Put on for my city, Or it would have fell apart, Nigga rap is like New York
Ain't no where to park
That's why I got a chauffeur, I don't need a valet, At the game, watchin' 'Bron give it up to Khaled
Not a hatin' bone in my body, nigga I salute 'cha
You disrespect my hood, I'll fuck around and shoot y 'cha
We got the world runnin' 'round throwin' up B's
Niggas saying "soo woo" like they're fucking chinese
Eyes tighter than a virgin when I'm blowing on these grapes, top down blowin' smoke on the fuckin' interstate

[Hook - The Game]


Bad intentions nigga
Fucking with the wrong one
Call Dre tell that nigga I'm on one
Aftermath nigga we blaze cuban cigars
Drive foreign cars into the stars
Fuck bitches at our leisure
Stuff dick inside they throat til they have seizures
Hoes down, B's up
Roll the trees up, Smokey Robinson
Start trippin, I like his jewelry, then I'm robbin son
Fuck a platinum plaque nigga hood with it
Bouncin that impala down the shore like what's good with it?
I'm a made man, I wear J's and
I been around more rocks than a fuckin cave man
I done sold it and bagged it
I done drove it and crashed it
Fucked my credit up smashin the Ashton
FYI nigga I got a magnum,
Only time I been punked was by Ashton Kutcher
I'm a motherfuckin butcher
Leave me around anything white and I'm a cook it
I be all up in the kitchin
No need for an apron, playboy
I'm a professional, I'm cakin playboy
The last real D-boy up in this rap shit
Chrome 24s with the fat lip, call the shits? cash
? Fuckin with the bomb squad
Dismantle any MC for free, you been warned god
Church, Higher power
Impala sittin clean like it took 5 showers
Nigga I'm the G.A.M.E. so don't you tempt me
Your chest'll be full and my clip will be empty
I'm simply one of the most raw niggas in this shit
Why you think that I got in this shit?
Paid for my momma house, bout 700k
Can't stop smokin but I'm down to a blunt a day
Yay, I mean yayo
On the block sun up sun down like where the day go?
We come through chargin nigga like San Diego
Seventeen chargers, couple of em same color but the shit is ok though
Cause all my niggas on the payroll get caught slippin, get a halo
And I ain't talking bout the x-box
Niggas let the tech knock
Welcome to the real life, black ops
Where it's still fuck the police, white and black cop
And we ain't killin Jonny, no
Nigga give em an ass shot
Put him on injured reserve
Tie my number twelves up and then I give him the bird, word
That's how I get down, all you rap niggas floppin
Who talkin shit now? only Drake and Yay worth coppin
I take a hiatus, spend a little time gamblin in Vegas
Come back to back runnin faster than five Lakers
So mother fuck a hater and his family
About to finish the R.E.D. album up in Miami
Lebron can't stand me, cause I got this purp in my cup
24s on the truck, Laker game nigga what?
Ballin, Jim Jones voice probably with the Byrd Gang
See the chrome boy? and my mother fuckin home boys
But I'm from Cali not to be confused with Khaled
He say that we the best but I'm the best that's valid
And before you try to say that that's a diss,
I was up at Khaled's house two days ago bitch
Sippin on a Long Island ice tea with a white bitch
That was just as bad as Ice-T's, but she's not the wifey
The wife be at home with the kid's
Look at them and see how a motherfucker live
24 cars, 5 and a half cribs, I was spending money like goin broke was the shit, shit.

[Verse 1]

My dawgs up north hear this, they gonna riot
I'm talking Red Cross, P.O.'s in their riot gear
What's this I'm hearing, New York's Big [?] yea?
Well now I'm here, ain't you glad?
All my dudes that held it down, I want to thank you fam
Thank you Kiss, WOW that's some gangsta shit
I'm going hard for New York until they clank my wrists, again
And since Wayne caught his locked up inside my pen
I've been watching from the side, I've been taking it in
Now I'm playing to win, I ain't playin' nigga
Play me I aim at your chin, then I'm straight to the pen
Do my time, come home and I'ma make it again
Glad to see Kim and Jim [?] making amends
Niggas makin em ends, instead of hatin on friends
We can all be Dame Dash and Jay on the bench
Throw my Yankee on, then I straighten the brim
Niggas disrespect my city, then he takin a swim
Got it fucked up looking for a King
One buried in Brooklyn, the other's in Sing-Sing

[Chorus]
Nigga Usher said Let it Burn, So I'ma let this shit Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.

Mel said Let it Burn, So I'ma let New York Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.

[Verse 2]
Nigga we can take it back to Illmatic or God's Son
Or we can blaze one for Big L, the good die young
Us niggas, in the Bronx, talking bout "Why Pun?"
Everybody mama in the hood talking "My Son"
Nope it's Mysonne, the hood's rap icon
New York's been dark and I'm back to turn the lights on
Back to when Tyson had us like "Yo the fight's on"
The fresh champion hoodie with my spikes on
With my christ on, gettin my dice on
Nigga it's the Bronx, you know I got my knife on
I rep the sewers and subways till I'm under that
Drop the beat, yo Flex let's bring the tunnel back
My city's shitty, sometimes my city's Diddy
Sometimes we cock hammers and get to the nitty gritty
Niggas dying out in New York looking for a King
He's buried in Brooklyn, the other's in Sing-Sing

[Chorus]
Nigga Usher said Let it Burn, So I'ma let this shit Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
The boy MB said Let it Burn, So I'ma let the streets Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
Absolute said Let it Burn, So I'ma let the city Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
Silkk said Let it Burn, So I'ma let New York Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.

[Verse 3]
What you niggas wanna hear about the lights and shit?
How I be all up in my mink with my ice and shit?
Nah Iâm too gully, yea the Bronx bully
Knockin on your door with the goons and the fully
On some Larry Davis shit, shooting through the door
What you expect? It's the apple we rotten to the core
Funk Flex, it's time to kill two birds with one stone
Yo Fif, "Hate it or love it", you and Game should do a song
Somebody tell Joe that Mys ain't with the BS
We both from the BX, so it's still TS
That's for the Cuban nigga and my Cubans
Sometimes it gets wild out here, Rick Rubin
On the FDR, the six moving, two strikers, Rikers, Lifers
Can't be stupid, so next time you get lost lookin for a king
Take a ride to Brooklyn, to visit the Sing-Sing

[Chorus]
Nigga Usher said Let it Burn, So I'ma let this shit Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
My girl Angie said Let it Burn, So I'ma let the streets Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
Funk Styles said Let it Burn, So I'ma let the city Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.
Kutt said Let it Burn, So I'ma let New York Burn, Burn, Burn, Burn.

[Game] 
Boom, guess who stepped in the room 
Dressed in black diamonds like a fucking monsoon 
Back from the dead but they never found my killer 
So I jumped up out this rave like Michael Jackson in thriller 
Iller than most emcee's cause I be killin' 'em 
Most emcee's turn into ghost emcee's 
Yeah, give a drummer some 
If 32 seville when that all black Hummer run 
Face off, Nicholas Cage with a gauge 
I'm famous for killin' rappers, my style, grenade 
Cook shit like Rae, the chef Raekwon 
The beats are filet mignon without the A1. 
Who walk like a pitbull, You? who bitch please 
I ate your favorite rapper's heart out with a 16 
Didn't hit the switch on something with fiends 
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie, that's Swizz Cheese!

Tupac and Juice riding [?] on the loose 
King James round my neck, haters wish it was a noose 
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe 
Kush out the jar, car smellin' like duke 
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I'm a goof 
Designer underwear she knows I'm a goose 
Got the wide body I'm a fat muthafucker 
In Swahili I'm screaming "stack muthafucker" 
Ya homie won't stop until I decide to 
Until then I'm making rollie's for the homies to ride to 
Smokes on the folds, folks wanna know 
Bitch I'mma boss, best foots on the blow 
Keep the hat pulled over, Big P on the front 
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt 
Being Savage where I'm from, Girls manage from the jump 
Don't trap me like a punk, Travis handing me the pumps, so...

Uncle chucky
Will you read us a bedtime story please huh please

Alright
You kids get to bed ill get the story book

Heeeeereeeee weeee go

Slam the Impala door and want do ya see
Some niggas hangin on the fence lookin at me
I had phat red laces in my Addidas
Big chain around my neck like Mar-di Gras
So I stepped up to them, "Is there a problem here?"
One nigga lifts his shirt then yells out "yeah"
So I turned around quickly and jumped in my car
I was about to hit the switch then I thought like "nahh"
So I reached under my seat, and I grabbed my shit
It was a chrome four-five with the kung-fu grip
Stuffed it inside my dickies as I jumped out the car
Kept my hand on the trigger as I walked to the store
One nigga walks in, then here comes two
"What did you do?"
> "I shot"
> "Are you crazy fool?"
One nigga hit the ground then the other two scrammed
Now the cops are outside
Well I'll be damned
It was 7:15 on my rolex watch
And I can't do the time that my Rolex got
And like the hands on the clock, I went this way, thatta way
Ran around the corner, and that's when I threw my gat away
And Impala passes, its my homeboy Clyde
He gave me the hand signal, so I jumped in his ride
It was a clean six fo, orignal inside
With no key in the ignition
> "Where'd you get this Clyde?"
Nevermind, I'm out, it's a stolen whip
And I'm already runnin from the cops and shit
So I hopped out the car like the dukes of hazard
Then Clyde yells out, "you stupid bastard!"
So I'm runnin though traffic and I almost get hit
I lost one of my shoes, its my airforce, shit
I'm haulin down the street with one shoe on
Walked straight into some niggas with all blue on
I only ran 30 blocks, how I end up in Long Beach
Cause in California the gangs in arms reach
He seen my red strings so he punched and caught me
So I knocked his ass out and took his boy out his Barklys
I ain't seen these since '92
I'm feelin like a "Bad Boy" without the shiny suit
Hear the cops come, shit, so I dash behind a Honda
Look who's here, my baby momma's friend Ronda
In the car kissin on this dope deala Chris
Little did he know he was suckin my dick
I start bangin on the window, I don't mean to disturb
But chris can you drop me off downtown, on third
He said sure, waddup game hop in
He was bangin slick rick then I got an idea
Before we get to third drop me off right here
So I can walk inside the mall and cop some new gear
As I walked into the store they could see I was in a rush
So they bought me some jeans, a t shirt and fresh chucks
Walked out the store, looked left, oh no
Ran back in the store, here comes the 5-0
So I ran real quick, made a move to the back
And knocked a cute bitch into a polo rack
"sorry", jumped over her and fled to the back door
Then I kicked the shit open, you won't believe who I saw
Its chris in handcuffs, pointin at me
And the cops made him chase me before they let Chris free
One cop tried to grab me, and the other one missed
I got away with more time, and they both got pissed
Ran straight out the mall, spotted this blue coupe
'dogg pound' on the plates, that's gotta be snoop
So I ran up the car and said yo snoop
The cops got me on the run, "need a ride nephew?"
Hell yeah big Snoop, little homie hop in
He dropped me off in compton, that's when my story ends
Now this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh
This another story about the wrong path
I had a big day, so I reclined my seat
It was a 20 minute ride to the C.P.T
Walked straight up to the house, pulled out my key
Opened the door, Its my girl playin Biz Markie,

[Excerpt from 'Just A Friend' - Biz Markie]
"Oh you, you got what I neeeeeeeeeed"


[Verse 1] 
This for my nigga C-Murder, locked away 
This for the nigga conscious that took Pac away

Come To My Hood It enough Good We Cocking Spray

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead 

[Verse 2] 
One thing about me, 
always keep it real with myself 
Like Nas, I'm Ill Will with myself 
And I can feel the pain of Ms. Wallace 
I wish Chris was here, so he could see C.J. blow 
Like the paint on this Impala 
Tell Afeni to holla if she need another son that rap 
Pac's revenge And I got a gun that clap like Dr. Dre snares 
Blow chronic like Dr. Dre cares 
I been there, done that Dr. Dre shares all his bitches and his liquor 
He ain't call me for Detox, but that's my nigga 
Remember Who Brought Em Back To Compton 
And 23 year Old Me was a fuckin Monsters 
Still Niggas Say I Ain't Hood what Fuck They Taking Bout 
Like I want Kiss My Son on the Head nd Chuck em out 
What up 50? Let's talk it out
But until we talk it out 

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead 

[Verse 3] 
I remember when my older brother wanted to be Rakim 
Now I'm livin' his dream, cause somebody shot him 
And left me like Eric B. without Rakim 
Still payed them for like B.B.S stock Rims 
Now I Got California locked In 
Dip in this Beamer, Same model, different year they shot Pac in 
So whats The Top 10 If You Dead 
Who Drop This Lamborghini If I'm In the feds 
To Times Feeling spelling my Nights Up In The Bed 
But I'm From Compton so When I'm Out Its Infrared 
Get My Son ready For School nd I kiss His Heads 
So When You See My Face In The Mirror 
If i End Up Dead Bed 
Never War Bullet Proof Vest and No Got Bullet Proof Car 
You Know Me Westside Triple O.G 
And I'ma tell you like the homie Snoop Dogg told me 

[Chorus x2] 
Don't Don't End Up dead 
Nigga Don't Don't up Dead


Dedicated to all my niggas up North 
Dedicated to the dirty South of course 
Dedicated to all my niggas on the East 
Dedicated to West Coast niggas is beasts ... 
This from us to you and all of them 
don't get gas my nigga watch your rims 

I started off in a hood, in what you would call a lemon.. 
Me? I was a nerd, niggas thought it was a gimmick. 
Now I got the maybach, curtains in linen.. 
White maranella with the burgundy in it. 
Tinted? 
For real. 
Now watch how we spin it. 
River side drive in about 5 minutes 
4 5 2.. 
achoo.. 
Make a nigga sneeze when we ride by you. 
Ice cream jeans with a march yellow top.. 
Polo 7-5-8s with socks. 
Am I high? 
Fa sho 
How we count dough? 
We count commas.. 
Yall niggas count 0's 
Come to VIP nigga we can count hos... 
Don't forget the candy pan sittin on vouges. 
Plus I got banana clips under my clothes.. 
This is redicated to niggas that flips O's. 

[Chorus]

Ayo come to Garcon.. 
Y saunt lauran 
You ever seen the hard bottoms on a long vauze? 
The bullets make a nigga hit the bottom real hard.. 
You ever seen the spikes on the new Lou Vuittons 
Spike a bitch drink make a bitch go hard 
Red Air Max with the fuckin Go-Karts 
When you already did it, what the fuck is go hard? 
Synchronize automotives, walk out with no charge. 
Wit yo broad, 
Oh lord, while your wife at somewhere typin 
We on Rodeo somewhere swipin.

Your chicks riding shotgun, had that as dikin 
Like Paquiao fightin.

[Chorus]

Top down, bumpin Bar-Kays..

You know I'm gang affiliated, don't get naughty. 
We could call henchmen.. 
Or we could call shorty. 
Or we could call Hector.. 
Or we could call Jorge. 
Papi owe me favors.. 
I know he wont ignore me. 
Everybody loco niggas gotta show me.. 
Tell ya girl there's a fire in my pants.. 
Blow me. 

[Chorus]


[Jim Jones:] 
Who's in charge? I'm asking y'all 
Somebody better answer before I blast at y'all 
Live life just as fast as y'all 
But you little niggas know that my cash is tall 
New York like Stoudemire 
You think your hot, well I'm on fire 
The money wash up and I'm tryna dry it 
If a new car drops, then I'm tryna buy it 
Cam front, kinda tired 
Had a bitch last night, left her in the higher 
At the party, music loud 
[?] move the crowd 
Then we Clinton Spark 'em 
Damn right, let my niggas chalk 'em 
All my dogs bite, we gon do the barking 
And the money speak loud, we gon do the talking 
And what you do with the bread 
U went to the ghetto and tell 'em Su Woo bred 
And I'm sorry to say, lift the back now home boy the 'rari today 
Such a horrible day

[Bun B:] 
Lights is flashing, cameras filming 
soon as we walked up in the building 
Bopers fainting, haters kneeling 
I smell like money, look like a trillionaire 
and I really don't care how you feeling 
Big-faced hundred dollar bills I'm peeling 
Bottles stacked up to the ceiling 
and I just can't explain the feeling 
Fellas, put your grands up 
Ladies, put your hands up 
We sipping Jimmy Neutron, player, and I can barely stand up

Blowing that orange kush all in my face 
Glock on my hip, nigga, murder was the case 
Any nigga want drama, boy, I hit 'em with the 'K 
Nigga act cool, nigga, hit 'em with a J 
Swim in that pool, Pat and Ryan all day 
Nigga need work, I got birds in the safe 
Ski mask in the cut hand, keys to the Maybach 
Where you lay at, bitch, I scope I never miss where I spray at 
Underground King, nigga, UGK that 
You should try crack all night, all day that 
Tell me where the weight at 
ZipLock baggies all in the trunk 
Going through the zone blowing that purple stunk 
Its the critics, get it? 
[?] only got straight A's in physics 
Dope boy business, Dope boy flashy 
Chains on my neck, elbows still ashy 
Hood nigga for real 
Ask my nigga Pharrell 
Turning my fingers on, the boy is the raw deal 
Chicks all dimes, the motto is cash peels 
Each one of them off down in Louis Vuitton heels 
Tell 'em muthafuckas that the legend is real 
Sleep next to a dime that I wake up to a meal 
House on the hills 
Where Hurricane lay his head at 
Anywhere in the U.S., that's where I get my bread at 
Nigga play the 9 by my waist, where the lead at? 
Anywhere that I shoot, same spot nigga dig that? 
Yellow take nigga 
Clinton Sparks on the California quake nigga 
When the light on, quick to kill a fake nigga 
Cash Money in my pocket like the Drake nigga (nigga) 

Lemme see you hit the floor (c'mon) 
I know that your with it

25 is what they couldn't see us living past 
we was broke just once 
someone give us cash 
Obama on the wrist, presidential Rollie 
Beverly Hills coppin', I ain't Axel Foley 

I'm just a young nigga moving like a Californian 
Word to proposition 19 in California 
I go from 0-60, a couple seconds 
she go from sober to tipsy and gettin' naked

Trey said he gon' meet us on the block of the club 
you heard Jerome, but instead of a Benzo 
get rid of your Friends-oh to ride in this Enzo

[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Once I had a little girl
Sometimes I think about her
But you know, she's not really there
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down

[The Reverend William Burk]
Yeah, we stepping in the spot, looking so fly
Dime on my arm, and I'm dumb high
Raised in the Chi, no need to ask why
I'm a playa til the day that I die
Curbing and stepping out from the back, back, back
The fans is making his pockets fat, fat, fat
If haters got problems, he got the gat, gat, gat
Just call him the new millennium mack, mack, mack
Playing them ladies, holding all the 3-80's
And, doing whatever to make a stack, stack, stack
Stepping up in the spot, looking oh so fly
Dimes on his arms, and he dumb high
Raised up in the Chi, never in need to ask why
He gon' play until the day that the boy die
Billionaire dreams, gaming ass swing
Yacht, saying things, getting that CREAM

[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down

[The Game]
Pushing my way through the hood in the 'lac, 'lac, 'lac
Gun on my lap, gotta stay strapped and I
Been through the Chi a million times, never been lost
Thinking I'm slipping, you sniffing lines, boy, I
Step out the house in my Louis shades and my
7-5-8's, Oakland A's, I'm feeling like
Goldie in the Mack, Mack, Mack
Bitch on my arm, look at her back, back, back
She make them dollars stack, bankrolls and
Crystal, Ferrari's, I'm
Driving and rolling the sack, fingers is fucking the cat
Feeling so smooth, and I'm thinking it's that, that, that
Roset was pouring like, fountains, I'm drowning
With 26's on the ride, look at the license plate
They say I'm a

[Chorus: Grand Funk Railroad "Heartbreaker" sample]
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down
Once I had a little girl
Sometimes I think about her
But you know, she's not really there
When memories do call, I just, I just can't live without her
But trying all the time, is so hard to bear
Heartbreaker, can't take her
Heartbreaker is bringing me down


[Intro: Doug E. Fresh (Game)]
Uh, uh, uh
Some say, "Who dat, cat runnin thru dat?"
Ask how he do dat? Easy [beatboxes]
"Who dat, cat runnin thru dat?"
Ask how he do dat? Easy [beatboxes]
Uh, yo wassup y'all? This is Doug E. Fresh
and I got my man Big Daddy Kane, and KRS-One is in here
and Game (yeah) Matter fact Game, you know what? (Yeah)

[Game]
Razor sharp, my flow is like a Crip and Blood fightin in the park
Come to Compton swim with the sharks
I know the REAL kings of New York
That make me five borough thorough, pass me the torch
A young Kane, I'm insane, my membrane
has the capacity to jack rappers and take chains
A lotta fake KRS', a lotta fake Game's
I'ma cash in on you niggaz and make change
Lil' ass dogs I'm a Great Dane
Product of hip-hop like spray paint on a freight train
and while you niggaz tried to make 'caine
I made 'caine with Kane playin, on that little tape thang
I got my first boom box in '85
Carryin that heavy motherfucker, I was maybe five
or maybe six, so what I'm tryin to tell you
is I've been fuckin with hip-hop since the 80s', bitch!

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
[KRS:] KRS-One spits like...
[Doug:] Doug Fresh beat box like R-R-RAH!
[Kane:] And you know that Kane spit like...
[Game:] and that's the reason Game spit like...

[KRS-One]
Rappers don't like when Kris on tour
cause when I rhyme they wrist don't glist no more
All you see is that Darfur
and these rappers promotin all this rape and war
I'm ignorant when I'm on tour
They say I'm down to earth cause I put rappers' brains on the floor
You heard that song, "Chicken Noodle Soup"?
That's what your head gon' look like in the back of your coupe
Like someone threw up in your rear-view
After you battle KRS-One no one's EVER gonna wanna hear you!!
Notice the style I'm usin, you losin
I'll (Scar) your (Face) like them cats in Houston
You know it's funny how y'all love to talk
but still stuck in the hood, I rose above New York
I be in the foreigns, heatin pounds of kush
You like a faggot in front of the pussy, beatin around the bush

[Chorus]

[Big Daddy Kane]
Aiyyo, you ain't got no other choice but to like it or love it
when you see me with (The Game), it's nothin like Michael Douglass
The black Cosa Nostra, he who got the most-a
the toxic flows and y'all lames is not supposed ta
I spit it clearly, my styles, the shit'll vary
When I write about cats, it's called obituaries
I never fuck with lames, so don't bring that nigga near me
I'm (Universal), your (Def-est Jam) is a subsidiary
One question playa: who wan' see
the realest of the real to spit it, two blunt leaf
I locked down the East and opened new country
and ran through the West when it was mostly 213
Lookum, I took 'um Brook-nam?
I look calm but I gotta enough hoods to start a crook farm
The god is in the building, and yes problems
When y'all buy chicks, all I do is test drive 'em

[Chorus]

[Outro: Doug E. Fresh]
Uh, now let me tell y'all somethin..
See this whole thing came together in a special way, ya know what I mean?
A very very special way
You just got the legends man, together...
and you just created, a whole nother' level
Cause on the real, Game straight up talk
From an emcee perspective, B
You are definitely... official, a legend, and respected
Because you come from the heart
and that's what a real emcee do, no matter what
And this was all just one night in the studio, man, just hangin out
That's what we did, that's what happened
And you know - R-R-RAH! R-R-RAH! R-R-RAH!
[beatboxes]
This is real, man!
[beatboxes]
This is all day!
[beatboxes]
This is hip-hop!
[beatboxes]
'til the very last drop, uh!
And y'know, lemme tell ya last thing
I'ma tell ya: it's about original, creation, from the heart
See, a MC KNOWS, without ever... tryin to be somebody else
Just do yo' thing and it'll always work out
[beatboxes]
Do dat, easy
[beatboxes]
I-ight Game, that's it man

Red bone, red car, ain't this bitch amazing
Red hot, red bottoms, spicy like she cajun
Red rims, red cuts lookinâ like a st-a-ar

This is what they call me in the ho-o-ood

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - The Jacka:]

That girl so high, I'm bout to knock her down soon
I walk into my roo-oom where them plants grow
She can't believe her eyes, I'm K-I-N-G and I smoke
Just wake up everybody with the Mazi when we come
Windows up, and a cloud of smoke cause we're young
We only live once, so every chance I smoke tree
And nigga I'm the king, don't nobody smoke me

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Mistah F.A.B.:]
King of the city and everybody knows
North, East, West, anywhere I go
Used to be the prince, now the king down East
And everybody talk about the things I did
Warriors, Raiders, yeah, you know that logo
Damn I got swag, all I wear is Polo
Play with your kids, don't play with the kid
If you play with the kid, get hit with the .44
Used to be loco
Don't throw for runnin' from the po po's
Then I get the dough, dough
Used to sip bo bo
Move real slow mo
Had a nigga leaning like I was a cholo
Been there, no though
Didn't get no ho
Now everywhere I go a nigga say...

[Hook]


[Hook - Pharrell:]
When you see me in my 64
My niggas, we roll and bounce
You should see me in my 64
When I make the bitch pop

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
I'd rather be on the block
With my 64 - hop in
I ainât for the video bitches car-hopping
I am for the Cris and Patron: bottle poppin
So if get it popin roll it up and hop in
The Game shine: the opposite of stock rims
So when it's Game Time, bring that Maserati drop in
So I can shine, push the button, pull the top in
Drop the top, tell lil mama to drop in
I like my ice creams with toppings
But we ain't going to the candy shop - we call it shopping
Homie for real, got your girlfriend locked in
Even the ballers say: we call it baller blocking

[Hook]

Your feet are the wheels, your legs are hydraulics
Bounce that, dump that, show me that you got it
"La la la la la la la la la"
I said your feet are the wheels, your legs are hydraulics
Bounce that, dump that, show me that you got it
"La la la la la la la la la"

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg:]
Rag back, Bose bass speakers, Kenwood amps
Vogues crawlin over train tracks
T.I. zip in the fo, yeah if you playing em back

Hat to the back, spilling drink on my lap
Beating down your blunt, get my trunk vibrating
Tipping and lock, the switches is hot
You might see me tripping through Watts

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - The Game:]
First nigga to put a '64 on 22's
Still hop on 22's
The Breitling's so blinding, it's frightening
Take my hoodie off, you like a deer in the highbeams
But it's so exciting
Floyd Mayweather is boxing in my ring
Only available in your dreams
It feel good to be me, so to you I am morphine
Get the club poppin, get the pain droppin
Your girlfriend get me off: Jonnie Cochran
She did a great job so I took her shopping
With your Black Card


[Verse 1 - The Game:]
She say she like a little bit of Drizzy, a little Weezy
A little Jeezy, a little T-Peezy
But that ain't me see, my phantom ride easy
Peanut butter inside, and she's my Reeses pieces
She gotta be mine, I don't do leases
I wear that baby phat out, like one of Russell's nieces
And I'm talking about the oldest one
And if I had to choose between them, she the coldest one
One Gucci, one Louie, one christian laby
Baby, maybe I should, I should draw the line but she gon' trace me
Walk in Jimmy Choo's and she dance like Stacey
Fuck the window shop she wanna try that thing on
I was like (yup!) but I ain't Trey Songz, I write Dre songs
And I bang Drake songs, I run this town
What the fuck is they on?

[Hook - T-Pain:]
I don't trust her
I shouldn't be within a thousand feet of her
But I love her
And if somebody else touch her, I go hard
Keep it sharp like the crease in my Khaki suit
She like my khaki suit she like my khaki suit yeah yeah

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
She says she's in the fashion
So I told her to a imagine
Gucci, Louie, Mark Jacob bags and
She on the catwalk, Tyra Banks she passed them
Love True Religions but can't fit the ass in
A size two, so what we gon' do is take it the BeyoncÃ©'s stylist
And she be wylin
Sayin that my rap be violent
I know how to keep that silent
Take her far, far from the hood, where ain't no sirens
Unless she listenin' to Howard Stern on Sirius
No, I mean Sirius, cause she's so serious
And I kills the cat, when the cat get curious
And you can take me as that, biohazarding
You should have your hazmat
If I took your girl, you can have your cat back
This the 106 new joint, and she just a flash back

[Hook]

I dip and dodge, I hit 3 and roll
fish and chips, bounce pass down to Pau Gasol
we don't give a damn bout the big 3
LA Lake show we bout to 3 peat
and you can bet, that's on the set
Ron Artest about to get wet
I'm on the flo' and that's a fact
sittin' next to uncle Jack blazin' up the purple sack

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]

[Game]
Louie Vuitton don
purple 24's, yellow Lambo I'm ridin'
top blew the guts doors goin' suicide
Stuff in the wood, niggas know we gon kill that
blow it in the air boy, know they gon feel that
purp and yellow, purp and yellow
watch me ball like you sittin' with Phil at
ten car caravan Aston Martin's and all them hood whips
them Cutlass's them Cadillacs's that leather be grippin' them wood tips
I was born up in the wood, claim Compton bet you ain't know that
pops taught me how to get low in the floor clap
went from a boy to a king, any block I five five four that
nigga better know that, boy they playin'
sawed off shotty
what they sayin'? nothin to a boss
I put two hoes in that LeCar
I come through fuckin niggas off
hop in that truck and get lost
you playin' wit a king not Gretzky
even if ya let me, keep yo girl wetter than Game on a jet ski
Oo, cool, who say he smoother than a baby's ass
pops was a dope boy we still spendin 80's cash
look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is
blowin on a scarecrow on my way to see the Wiz

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]

[YG]
Ridin' down Rosecrans, Compton, California
turn on the wrong street they might bang on ya
home of the Lakers baby, yea you know its purp and yellow
take a hit of what I got, I bet it have you seeing doubles
But I'm an angel though, and your girls a pigeon
its money over everything, girl you know the vision
never been a mark if ya with it we can cut ya fade
brought out 50 blew up the city, young Saddam Hussein
Pusha Ink the label baby, everything else is fuckin boring
I'm at Roscoes eatin wit some chicks who foreign
I took your girlfriend from you boy you's a mark
my white Beamer do the Wiz Khalifa, push to start

[Chorus Repeated]


[Chorus:]
I gotta sing you rap niggas a song before I put you to bed
So close your eyes just one last time as I put you sleep
Nigga rest in peace, you don't want no beef, 
Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you 
Rest in peace, you don't want no beef, 
Don't make me pull the piece on em, throw up the peace on you 

As I hit corners in that Lamborghini swervin' 
Them doors fly up, look like I'm riding in a bird
So sick, put the 22's a inch from the curb.
Watch the niggas fade away like the smoke from the herb.
So I hop out, in my true religion denim,
Cause guns my true religion,
And my Desert Eagle's in 'em.
Then I pull out;
Like I should have did when I was twelve, she had a miscarriage anyway,
Oh well, back to my story.
I start shootin' up the block
They shootin' up block, "Oh shit! It's the cops!" 
No is not, (woohoohoohoo)
It's just the ambulance, put another clip in and let the hammer dance.

[Chorus]

I swear to God, these niggas runnin' so fuckin' fast that,
One nigga tripped so I shot him in the ass.
"Why you make me do that?"
I'm usually a cool cat, like Kool Herc, Kool G, or any other cool nigga that rap.
But I ain't come to talk, I came for revenge; to avenge the death for my hip-hop friends.
I know, I know you never meant to get 'em killed, never meant to drive the car,
They never handed you the steel
Apologize now. I know when you see him you will,
But I got one question:
"Nigga how does it feel that they're going now, and you're going now?"
Put it to his dome, (BLAAAOW!) He is going home now, bye.

[Chorus]

My Air Force Ones are comfortable, but they not built to last
Especially when you chasin' motherfuckers up and down the ave.
Niggas hit a couple fences, ran through some backyards,
And I am not Reggie Bush, I'm heading back to my car.
As I walked around the corner, I was like,
"Damn! Los Angeles PD's behind my Lam - Bo."
Runnin' my plates, before I can hit the gate,
I can hear the cops yelling out, "Wait!"
So I turn around, approach my shit,
He said: "Aren't you the guy that used to sing with 50 Cent?"
"Why, yes I am." 
That was my reply,
"My daughter loves your songs, good day."
"Good bye!"

[Chorus]


[Lil Wayne]
Pardon my gang affil,
But you're stepping on a rod in the danger field
Weezy Baby, how do the Manger feel?
Respect my aim because I aim to kill
Hahaha, Old bitch ass nigga,
Abercrombie and Fitch ass nigga,
I talk rich shit because I'm a rich ass nigga,
I hope you in the zone because I pitch fast nigga,
Ha, I smoke something bitch,
My money comes faster than the roadrunner bitch
I keep it on the side just in case you might wonder
Tech 9 Four 5 just in case you like numbers
Haha, bitch nigga we might jump ya
2 Step all in yo face, we might Unk ya
Hahaha, bandana on the right side
East side until I die

You better change like it's Mardi Gras,
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar
Lemme hear you say Su Woo
Su Woo, Su Woo

[The Game]
Young Money
And that's perfect cause perfect is to me
What's perfect as Hallie or a jab from Ali
So capitalise the P cause perfect is Godly
Black Wall Street, the perfect family, The Cosby
All I need is a perfect bitch
How's B, I passed the baton on Solange
I'm sure like Al B but a boujy B would never give me the perfect PIRU
Hello Brooklyn I can't see, cause if I did I would SNOOP DOGG
Cut it in half and you will see that this Philadelphia piece on my head
Like a low Ceaser, wear it to the hood and get me street cred like Four Visa's
niggas fucking with Weezy, I will slow leak em
Hang em from a telephone pole like my old sneakers
Red bandana for no reason
Put Weezy on and the NO bleedin', yeah

[Lil Wayne - Chorus]
You better change like it's Mardi Gras,
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar
Lemme hear you say Su Woo
Su Woo, Su Woo

[The Game]
Can't stop the red bandana, even if you put me in a cage full of orangurtan's
I'll show you how bangers bang
Four five cocked back, move the crowd like Dana Dane
Switch plates, paint the Range
Leave so much blood on the wall look like the fucking painters came
Dead wrong ain't it man
I told niggas I ain't a Game
All black gold chain, looking like the saint is playin'
He sold a milli, I'm vanilli
So it ain't a thing to make it rain in a hundred dollar bills
We throwing paper planes
Riding through the N.O.
Red Marc Jacob frames
We disappear like David Blaine
And pop up at the Lakers game
They playing the seeds with Paul ? in the B's
That make the ref affiliated, everytime he hit a three
Ken Griffy lost all his fans, taking off his red top
Bloods in New York like Manhattan took a head shot
I'm one blood, he's the Carter with the dread locks
My whole team run base, we the fucking Red Sox.

[Lil Wayne - Chorus x2]
You better change like it's Mardi Gras,
And we pull guns like Quick Draw McGraw
See I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana
And he's from Compton, baby, bandana
We carry them caskets, we tote them hammers
Su to the Woop, yeah, that's our grammar
Lemme hear you say Su Woo
Su Woo, Su Woo


[Game - Chorus]
Let me introduce you to the Taylor gang
That's my nigga Wiz and I'm Chuck Taylor mayne
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mayne
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
So throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made

[Game]
I wake up in the morning to Red Converse
Dre Beats on, listening to Bomb first
You got a hangover nigga, mine's worse
Haze got me kicking knowledge like a Nas verse
Shit be complicated like out of towners
trying to understand why we say waddup Blood
but we not related
That's how Compton made it,
so don't run around yelling Soo Woo without a Chuck Taylor confirmation
On that documentary shit I shocked the nation
Muhammad Ali shit like I boxed in Vegas
When it come to beef shit, nigga I'm the greatest
I knew I was next the night they shot Pac in Vegas
I ain't a killer but don't push me
I see a bitch looking, I'mma end up in her pussy
See ya later, fuck haters, cause bitch we Taylors
Bitch we major

[Game - Chorus]
Let me introduce you to the Taylor gang
That's my nigga Wiz and I'm Chuck Taylor mayne
We both known in our hoods like Chuck Taylors mayne
We get high, fuck hoes, and roll paper planes
Cause we Taylor made, we the Taylor gang
Blowing smoke into the face of those haters mane
We all stars in the hood like Chuck Taylors mane
Sso throw it up and keep repping the Taylor gang, if you Taylor made

[Wiz Khalifa Verse]
Probably heard I'm the tightest
And I heard that you never smoked so I rolled it, you light it
And I heard that you liked it
And I welcome you to my world you've been cordially invited
Now I got the whole world excited
Know every word when they heard that I write it
Know I can fuck every girl cause my jewelry the brightest, and my herb is the lightest
Some niggas mad I made it, blame it all on perfect timing
I say I made it big cause I stuck to the cursive writing
These niggas rather be a has-been then not be famous at all
I learned you ain't really gotta be famous to ball
I'm hustling hard, and turning bitches to custumers soon as they get in front of us,
Bad hoes after the shows rushing up
Baby them niggas clowns talk down but they look up to us
May look the same but I'm nothing like them suckas
So fuck what them niggas sayin' and keep reppin' the gang

[Game - Chorus]


[La Roux - Sample]
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Oh I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
[x2]

[The Game]
Let me crack this Patron and talk to you for a minute
Won't you put that blunt down 'fore you put the chronic in it
Before you do that drive by, listen for a second
Why you need a 45 when your mind is a weapon
If you use it like you 'posed to than you could be Malcolm X
Instead of counting body bags, my nigga should be counting checks
Don't be a follower nigga, be a leader
And if that mean's I'll lose you on Twitter than so be it
Had a daughter yesterday, see my baby momma bleeding
Remind me of Keyshia getting shot down while she was feeding
Her baby in the projects, I'm supposed to be proud of Compton
I'm just glad me, Damare and Brandon made it outta Compton
I put on for my city like Jeezy say
Iron out my red rag just for Free Weezy day
And since they did Oscar grant like Emmett Till
Crack the Patron seal

[La Roux - Sample]

[The Game]
I can take you back to '03 when ain't nobody know me
My game was regional like the Lower Merion, Kobe
Teach me how to Dougie, come here little man, show me
Clutching on his momma leg, remind me of the old me
Ain't trippin' off no old beefs, ain't grinding on my old streets
I'm in the hills smoking on cigars like an old G
Cooley high coochie, Levi's no fleece
Space jam Jordan's killin' 'em without the cold sheets
Rappers say they trappers and these trappers think they rappers
Go listen to Blueprint, your all hustling backwards
Shout out to my reall niggas, Birdman, Styles P
Kiss my nigga Sigel, know them Philly niggas wild b
Snoop you insane cuz, Bun you a trill one
Nas, we forever since you helped me get a deal son
And my nigga Fab, write his verses like a wheel
He walked out the booth, it's my turn

[La Roux - Sample]

[The Game]
If I ain't never told you nothing, I think you might wanna listen
Leaving Aftermath and G-Unit was never my decision
But I'm back now, when we recorded Back Down
Once friends, now foes, both our phones tapped now
50 was my nigga, but life was funny like that
Eminem played the bandage and Dre was the ice-pack
So I unwrapped the guards, but my scars never healed
Sometimes stars align and some stars never will
Like Ross and Jeezy both y'all my niggas, y'all should chill
Instead of beefin', lets remember how baby blue got killed
How Wolf got shot down, how Meech got locked up
When niggas start beefin' you should give them some Ciroc Puff
And pour me a shot, my own brother want me dead
Worse than that, my nigga Young Buck got raided by the Fed's
So Timbaland, Cool n Dre Just Blaze and Pharrell
Next track I get nigga...

[La Roux - Sample]


[Hoo -: Dr. Dre:]
(Tryna' find the ocean) It's over here
(Tryna' find the ocean) Yeah, it's to the left
(Tryna' find the ocean) Cause we ain't hard to find, follow the sunshine
(Fuckin' everywhere
Do you know where to find me, right under that palm tree island)

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
I'm goin', goin'
Take a flight like a motherfuckin' Boeing
Aftermath, and faggot like you ain't knowin'
We stack Bentleys, drive fast cars
And fuck with multiple minages
Livin' the largest, nigga we heartless
How could you blame us?
Crooked cops, they frame us
They mad cause I'm more famous than Amos, right?
Taking cookies from these rookies could be dangerous, right?
Salute your motherfucking city of them Angels, right!
That entertain the life, that ain't the life that we livin'
Most of my niggas is better off in prison
Wishin', missing
They fuckin' kids, man, they fuckin' wife, man
The double meaning only caught up with that white man
Turn off the lights, man, put up the lights, man
Let 'em know we still got it for the right price, man
And you could disappear for the right price, man
This the left culture, best know everybody get lost just...

[Alternate Hook - Dr. Dre:]
(Tryna' find the ocean) It's over here
(Tryna' find the ocean) Yeah, it's to the left
(Tryna' find the ocean) Cause we ain't hard to find, follow the sunshine
(Fuckin' everywhere)
Where the beaches? Where the bitches?
You know, right here, so come on in

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
Well, I'm gone man
They out of Goose, get Patron then
Can't sell it, move it by the zone and
The money talk, only conversate with grown men
The paper real basic, like the birds that get flown in
California hotties, like furniture in my lobby
Where I'm from, don't you know? Nigga, drinkin' ain't a hobby
I'm bi-coastal, nigga don't make me go postal
You know I keep the Glock 9 comfy in my holster
I'm supposed to ride roasters
Sip bottles on Louis coasters
Feed bitch niggas to the vultures
What, you mad cause I'm back with the doc?
Money, alongside the yacht
Diamonds inside of my watch, ballin'
We all live playin' poker with this rap shit
Game time chips on the table, you know how I get
Hundred thousand Benz
Million dollar checks
Lookin' on my city, kinda hard when you standin' through the clouds and...

[Hook]

[Bridge - Dr. Dre:]
Whenever you touchdown in Cali, be prepared
Cause niggas there, might put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
Put your life on the line
If you wonderin' where I be
You know where to find me
I'll be right by that ocean
Don't get it twisted
It's the fuckin' pacific
Come and see, I be right by that ocean

[Outro - Busta Rhymes:]
From comin' to follow that order
Understood? We comin' from the water
From comin' to follow that order
Understood? We comin' from the water
[?]
(Tryna' find the ocean
Tryna' find the ocean
Tryna' find the ocean)


[Hook:]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round
Round and round

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Back to the hoes
Ridin' down 7-4th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin from afar, can't catch em know
But they getting smacked when we do
Ra ta ta like we snoop
Crown on the vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Keeping pounds of the blue
Ivory in it, tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J's, closet full of J's walking on my crib and he's Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like it's already in it
Murder with the ink, I'm Gotti in it
Don't get too popped if yo ass 2 Pac
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain't never holly that but I got a Maserati in it
That's my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas' ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same stacks on, bring the bands out, nigga should be workin on they money skeme
Back to the convers, kill em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Callin Archurelli, tell him niggas in one hearse
'Cus Compton ain't like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas love them choppas like we flyin in black cars
But you with the roost, thinkin a nigga was black though
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - ScHoolboy Q:]
Pray for me, I'll make 30
Desert, even my nails dirty
Everything on life and I'd die for it
Made a mill, you ain't even know it
Tell Iluminati I'm down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Some niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I've been paid
I'm a real nigga, you's arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama's couch
Now I'm going big, I can buy the house
You sound water down, I sound of an ounce
See this for those who say "where you from"
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don't fuck around
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum
If the bed low I'm a stack the crumb
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G's, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it's sun and trees
10 keys with my 8 G's
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless kidney faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't doin aimin'
Move out the set but the set I'm banging

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Skeme:]
Look, a young nigga really tryna stunt, fuck it
West side eagles and I ain't budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain't about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain't sayin nothing
This flow here, niggas can't touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Sox gang off in the streets
10 hut, big squads are with me
See niggas 12 ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vet? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I'm a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I'm on, look at me
Started, started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood niggas gotta know that that's all me
See the set catch rap
When I slide through throwin up a bill
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like, we said boy please
This S to the K to the E to the M nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga
Got a 5 cocked back like boom nigga
Got enough room to fill up a room nigga
And I'm all in these, had 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin for more
Pay me a millie, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain't got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it
I swear that you love it
I just left from Newark, got bands in my luggage
Play with you rappers, my nigga
This black mack
Take out my dick, take a piss on the public like fuck it

[Hook]

[Welcome To California:]
[Intro - Too Short:]
Welcome to California bitch
Welcome to California bitch

[Hook 2:]
Ski's not the only place
Sounds like a BS
I know another place
Where you can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining
You can't stop the shining

[Verse 4 - Game:]
Nigga done run everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home
C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from grandmother's porch to my executive Porsche
Now I'm driving through London alone
With a Parisian bitch
Rockin corn rolls, backseat of my Panamera watchin pornos
Where we goin?
What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg
Nigga city in ruins then fly to Dubai
On my poolside, coolin my Audemar
You waterproof fuckin gone, let em know that I admit
Everywhere around the world and that's cool
But can a hotel fuckin reserve us parked through
My hood gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move to back to Compton shit, we are too
Condos and wheels to shit, I bought two
Livin down the street where BIG got shot, I hunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It's how we live our life, surrounded by tape
Pause

[Verse 5 - Game:]
Where the angels fly, city of angels... I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That's why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don't get it confused, said he still got moves
Where the wrong colors niggas end up on the news like Sal
Like Durant in a dream then I'm right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had the hot niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts would you walk through it?
Would you be from great street or would you Piru it?
Here's my red raggers that's ain't nothing to it
There go the 60's, motherfucker good luck
(Welcome to California bitch)
They were the 60's, motherfucker good luck

[Verse 6 - Schoolboy Q:]
From the corner where that ho said that hit kat
Short dress, hair down her bizac
You know me with my thumb in my index
Nah, I ain't bloodin nigga
Pass blunts to my cousins nigga
Turn hale into gold, I can pon the river
High power, you a amish liver
Cali dro in my lungs and such
Twisted blunts from dawn to dusk
My shoe box should've been a armored truck
Everything good, feeling marvelous
Came to the city, that you honored us
You don't talk me a game, no game homie
Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it
Uh, Mr. 3rd degree
Burn like the bridge and yo business uh
Started at the floor, at the beginning uh
Now I rep the floor until the ending uh
Smoking on ills cause I'm winnin
Wax getting blowed, just the pin lit
Uh, yea now back to the booth, back to the hoes
Ra ta ta in the lap with the 2
No Cali J, I still ran all blow
All in the trim, straight lookin like you
Free tattoo

[Verse 7 - Schoolboy Q:]
I'm in the gangsta shit, gangsta clothes and gangsta crib
Need a gangsta bitch to take the dope and hop the fence
Might die on the freeway
Hey, much love to the he way, aye
Watch you know about LA?
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they dome us
(Welcome to California bitch)
Stay low from the comas
Make a right fore they...

[Hook 2]

[Verse 8 - Skeme:]
Got a bitch, say she wanna fuck in Beverly Hills
And I swear I'm a bring her to the set if she will
And if I do the pussy better killin
Just the way I make her feel, no step in they mills
These niggas hella be trip, these niggas never be real
I came up in a world where it's kill or be killed
I swear that every bitch I used to fuck fuck me still
Just give a dick, never covered a bill
This shit is real, this west side INGFCF
Bands on them bitches, getting M's on them bitches
Going for the Cartier, hands on the bitches
Last long like I'm using extends on them bitches
I'm a native, I got real niggas with me
Gold state, gold grills, I put on for the Betty White
Middle fingers for the peace
Tell them bitch niggas suck a dick
Man come and get me out

[Hook 2]


[Hook:]
The other day I had breakfast with Al Pacino (politicking)
Told him I wish he was in casino (probably checking)
Breathe
Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino (hood nigga)
Eating breakfast with Al Pacino was good nigga
Please

[Verse 1:]
My life a movie directed by Tarantino, my Lambo lounging the kimo
I'm at that fork in the road like a torturous Hov
I ain't wanna sell blow, I was forced to that stow
See, I was forced to be hard, without multiple goals
So I multiplied and magnified that coke, till I was satisfied
Took oath in my last supply, I kept my tenants classified
My momma ain't know nah
My daddy and my uncles gave me bundles,
Put it on bees I made it bumble
Bred 11's, thou should not stumble
In bed by eleven, that's where she thought but I'm in a jungle,
Sayin no this ain't no training day
I'm on that track, but I put them trains away
And my enemies on this train today
My dreams is where them bangers lay
The sky is where my fingers stay
Unless I bring the K, and choppers making rainy day
Niggas praying to Yezus
Remember before he was famous, yeah!
A younger game would say

[Hook:]
The other day I had breakfast with Al Pacino (politicking)
Told him I wish he was in casino (probably checking)
Breathe
Fresh out the kitchen with waffles and cappuccino (hood nigga)
Eating breakfast with Al Pacino was good nigga
Please

[Verse 2:]
And if you must know, nobody's perfect
We screw up, we make mistakes
Have heart breaks, go through hard times
But you need to know that's life
The world ain't full of assholes
But they strategically play
So that you could come across one every day
You know what I'm saying?
Sometimes things that happen in life are not part of a plan
But when that happens, don't give up on your dreams!
Just find another way to reach em,
Just give your food for thought, ladies and gentleman
Worrying won't stop the bad from happening
But it will stop the good from being a joy
Yes sir!


[Verse 1: Game]
Jogging my memory, the Documentary
Killed that in a drop top John Kennedy
Had the rap game in fear, like it was ten of me
The old me ain't got shit on what I'm finna be
Nigga I'm finna be still repping the letter B
What if it was the nigga that Dre signed instead of me?
Would I be starving or studying at Harvard
Or would I be a dog of a another fuckin' pedigree
Take away me, take away the su-woo
Take away the gangstar like hip-hop did Guru
Pull up in that new coupe
Take away your girl run her choo choo
Then put it on Worldstar, or Youtube
Yo Tune' what it do
Got some bitches in the lobby and I'm 'bout to send them through
I'm Kobes rings nigga who the fuck is you
Not the nigga with five bitches sitting in the coupe

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Five, got Jacksons in my pocket and I'm feelin' like a Jackson
Five, I'm ballin', ya I'm ballin', got me feelin' like I'm in the Fab 5
For as long as I live I will rep for five
Like MJ in game five

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got five on it
Five short, Young Tune in this bitch fuck 5-0
Nickel plated 4-5 if I have an issue
Beat your ass black and blue with a bag of nickels
Iâm a G, do somethin âbout it
You ainât half of me, you ainât 500 dollars, nigga
And my red bone, 5-5
No hand slapped, but Iâm high five
Yeah get with the game or play the sidelines
I dream to get the cover of High Times
Now take 5 paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces, red, bitch
Yeah, Iâm on my high horse
Now the sky mad at me cause I stole five stars
Got some freaks in the living room gettinâ it on
And they ainât leavinâ til five in the mornâ
(yeah)Young Tunechi, bitch!

[Hook]

I deserve to be top five


[Hook - The Game:]

[Verse 1 - The Game & Elijah Blake:]

Peanut butter guts in the whip
Project dirty got the pyrex burning
Totin' iron moving birdies

Got my thugs with me, got my bloods with me
Maserati do a buck fitty

[Bridge - Elijah Blake:]
I fear no nigga, I trust no bitch
And these pretty bad broads be all on my dick

Fuck a bitch [x6]

[Verse 2 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]

Drop racks on a case, that's a gag order
Tough talk turn to sad stories
Fuck a bitch if he die that's too bad for it
Fuck a bitch I'm too fly, I'm a asshole

[Bridge]

[Hook - The Game:]
Fuck a bitch [x6]

[Bridge]

[Hook - The Game:]
Fuck a bitch [x6]


[Verse 1: The Game]
I was forced to be a gang banger
On the cover of The Source with my chain hanging
That was '05 still Fuck Benzino
Riding through the city with them twin benzitos
Stepping on C-Notes, rolling red dice like casinos
Throwing 'tron shots like free-throws
Tell Judas I'm alive and well
Will I be crucified only time will tell until then I'm thugging
Spend my money on whatever
Running through this cheddar as long as my crew together
Pop Ace, pop tags, pop hammers
"Thug life" I put that on Pac's bandana
Los Angeles King, tell my niggas in the Bing
I blacked out the card and minimized the bling
Updated the Ghost, went Nas on the wig cap
And made wifey ring rocky ASAP, yea
(aha, let's go)

[Hook: Sam Hook]
This right here reminds me of when
The playas had the the dope so the girls brought their friends
And every single night we did it again
We had a good time, we had a good time
In the city

[Verse 2: Fred the Godson]
I was forced to be a force
Diamonds in my cross, the cost for me to floss
Got me exhausted
Exhaust that's on the Porsche, got me wide awake
Just make sure that my wallets caked while I wait
The coupe drop well
Got banana clips in the Big Apple, homie, fruit cocktail
Eh Game what it look like
I got the shorty and I'm playing with her chess (chest) on the corner, look like a rook right?
The city that never sleeps
We ain't talking bout money, we prolly will never speak
Lobby within a week, we generated revenue
Old heads put me on the things that I never knew
I'm big in New York word to my moms baby
And its hard to be the Giant just ask Tom Brady
That's why they pay me
When you ask who the best right now that's why they say me
Fred in the game peace

[Hook]


[Intro:]

Spending all my motherfucker money and live like goddamn bitch
Can a motherfucker live?

Brand new dead, drop top Gatti
Kobin up grove, can a motherfucker live?
Flies and jet, motherfucker live
MIA buzzing like a motherfucking bee
Real nigga here, real nigga career

Six bottles Ciroc, couple hoes in here
Couple old niggas from a 4-4 in here!
Nigga ain't dolo here

Ain't nothing new, I've been fucking with Wayne!

[Hook:]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know
In the club we're startin to popping off and you know
20 K, a king of diamonds, bitch, and you know
California king, hoe, just so you know
And you know,

Just so you know!

[Verse 2:]
Listening to this Big Sean like, "oh shit!"
My lil nigga Kendrick kills you on your own shit
But I fuck with Sean
It's just Compton, nigga
I helped him get his Jesus piece back from the mobsters, nigga!
I've been the middle man for rap niggas and jury niggas
Ask me find that shit like I'm motherfuckin Siri.
IPhone, ass nigga! Five homes, yes nigga!
New coupe slide back with the roof
Hunned 80 proof, gotta throw it back to proof
Air Jordan Ones, North Carolina,

[Hook:]
Hanging out that window, throwing West Side up, like Pac and you know

Operation kill everything kill everything
Married to myself fuck a wedding ring
Tried that shit twice
Gave that girl everything
She a good woman
She got good goals
Love her to death but can't be in that fishbowl
Niggas gotta live and what the fuck does it matter?
If I take care of my kids
I got three of them little niggas
And every time they smile
I see me in them little niggas
I get my heart I get my soul
And nobody fucking with me till Harlem 20 years old
Any day I'm gonna retire
Look back at my career
Like I started from the bottom
Now I'm motherfuckin here
Look back at my career like I started

Started to do something
Shit I've been working out for two summers
In the gym I piled on cruel summer
When everybody doping your clique you do numbers
But I ain't got no clique
Still got the same cars and broads sucking my dick
Still fuck the same stars that up in my six
Still finding old panties and broads up in my whip
This bitch got my dick hard as Rock Nation
That's like Cole and Hove at a show keeping fans waiting
And you know they ain't go do that
Girl go and do that
Guess it's time to turn up
I got a whole lot of marijuana to burn up
And I ain't mean to make you stop
But it ain't a party without aqua hydrate and Ciroc so

What's up? It's yo boy Diddy man
I'm just getting back from Vegas
Yeah man, party was off the chain
I'm back in sunny California and it never rains
Yeah yeah yeah all that man
So I decided to throw a white party man
So I'm at the mansion now
Got the pool, filled it up with aqua hydrate
So you know when the chicks in the pool, they correctly balanced
And also got Ciroc fountains overflowing
Blue dot, red dot, white dot
I want you to come bring the whole crew
Bring out West Coast love
The whole white party man
And we gonna leave colors at home, I know you wanna be all red man
But you gotta wear all white to this one man
You gotta wear all white to this one man
I see y'all like the white party at the mansion man
Y'all let's get it, love
Ay yo chop, for real, wear all white

Love it's Ash, I got this fired up Kush from my cousin
I'm a come over and smoke it later alright?
Alright

Hey Lucky it's Andrea
Calling you from this bitch Ashley's house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick
And she ain't even know it
Hey Lucky it's Andrea
Calling you from this bitch Ashley's house
I'm bout to suck the skin off yo dick
And she ain't even know it

Guess we're going to Diddy's
It ain't a party without the king of the fucking city
Handsome ass nigga these bitches is fucking with me
Woke up in that new Bugatti
These pigs ain't fuckin' with me
I'm like Dr. J with his frown
Something like Boston Georgia with the blow
Pumping white hat, I got it just so you know
Slumber life I'm zipping up all this dough
Summer nights we at toxic with all these hoes
Then we back at the mansion take off them clothes
I let my niggas hit it first
I'm in and out
Just as fast as niggas spit a verse then they out
Then I'm back to the booth
Rollin up sipping something 80 proof
And I don't chase the liquor or these hoes
Heard Jordan got some new shit out book order those
Just bought me a ghost like where the Rolls
Perrier at the club with all my bros
Can't get none of my bitches to get these hoes
Plus I sit back and still get paid like Derrick Rose

Stat we then started something
Stat we then started something
Stat we then started something
Ready to die almighty get a car or something
Unzip that Louie, go buy a car or something
We just started something
Stat we just started something
Ready to die almighty get a car or something


I am happy to join with you today
In what will go down in history
As the greatest demonstration for freedom
In the history of our nation

So it seems I'm lost
In between exotic cars in Phoenix
Palms hella itchy baby mama bitchy
Dish washer broke cause them pots too sticky
Snap back to the back cause I got that crack
And I'm from that city
Where even the girls is packed
And I'm strapped this zone they don't hear that rap
Shit unless it's watch he a problem
Then them bitches turn up ASAP
Like they went to school in Harlem
But they know they from Compton
Yeah they know they from Compton
Where we put bass with the head
Before Dre was with Monster
We pull guns on niggas before we ever play contra
Turn up countering they bands and
I make them hoes dance so
Let that bitch breathe before she take yo kids
And you be forced to watch that bitch leave
And that's every nigga's situation
In a town where them gang signs go up
And them bitches going down

Life is a but a dream
I'm searching for a dream
So I'm finally free
Don't let me, don't save me
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
I'm searching for a dream
So I'm finally free
Don't let me, don't save me
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream
Life is a but a dream

A great American in whose symbolic shadow
We stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation
But one hundred years later the nigro still is not free

Niggas rock two chains and one star
I seen these niggas runnin
Them ain't yo niggas no more
Cause I got macks comin
You take a nigga jewels
And act like you done did something
We take a nigga life and act like we ain't did nothing
And all of this is like a push of a button
I got niggas bustin simply because they ribs touchin
And we ain't tryna work the Nicky D
Niggas is tryin to put that six on D's
And flip one of them Bentley keys
Hood niggas that only wanna be hood with
Stack 100 cash and then you safe and wife a good bitch
Cop a Gucci belt maybe in Louie 2
Line at challenger with that Camaro
And see what it do?
Hit toxic cause we got a fit and cane wasted
It's hot as fuck but at least we can see these hoes' faces
And it's drama what that shit do
Every time we hit the city
Give'em a couple hoes and a pistol
Cause I, I hold my niggas down
I said I, I hold my niggas down
Yeah I hold my niggas down
And the day I go out this is Kendrick's crown

No we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied
Until justice rolls down like waters
And righteousness like a mighty stream

Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Life is everything but a dream


[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down

[Verse 1:]
My Momma in a Coma, I don't know how to fucking feel
But what I do know is today my life fucking real
Holding my tears inside trying not to fucking squeal
Where is Jesus when I need him to grab the fucking Wheel
They say if it's fate it's fate no ain't nothing seal
Staying strong when I really want to pop a fucking pill
Looking at my mama just laying here, fuck hospitals blood I ain't staying here
Choked up, my mama all doped up
Make me wanna have all of my enemies scoped up
But my son just walked in and wanna see his grandma
But I can't let him see you like this, Damn Ma
What the fuck we doing? What the Fuck we Doing?
Something happen to you my whole fucking life is ruined
Let the lord take me from my fucking Mamma, I'm a Kill myself
Break in heaven then it's going to be drama

[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down

[Verse 2:]
I don't never wanna know how Kanye feel
But right now I wouldn't feelin how I can't feel
Fuck being Game, fuck being rich
Anybody that ever owed me money, I feel like Money Makin Mitch
I can't make dinner but I can make a fuckin ditch
My pops said don't even check on er, you a fuckin bitch
Head of the Compton right now, I'm a see you there
Matter fact it's better off, I'll just leave you there
And let you rot nigga, til you in the box nigga
From now all this thug life, I'm positive I'm pop nigga
We can have it on the world for what could be
I'm out here, get any nigga try to shoot me
Who grew up in Compton? Who was born in Inglewood? Me
Two days left on death row is where I should be
But I'm right here waiting for her to wake up
Like please don't die, mama wake up

[Chorus:]
Running away from what was worse
Your love is burning me down
Finding a way from what was worse
Your love is burning me down


[Chorus:]
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime

[Verse 1:]
I'm sitting in my Ghost, I don't know what to do
But what I know is I'm at my best when I fuck with you
I always thought we'd kinda end up just like the Huxtables
Thought our love was like Swizz and Alicia, untouchable
Thought we always had that Jay and B potential
And ever since we've been apart everything is instrumental
And I can't even hear the words to my favorite song, I'm so numb inside
Bitch you telling me "boy, I'm ovulating, so just come inside"
I'm kinda torn between what I want and what I know
That's why sometimes after the kids fall asleep I get up and go
Used to chase me down the hallway, acting like you on Broadway
Hop in your Benz, tailing my Range, trying to jump out where that broad stay
And that was crazy but at least I know you care
That was then, this is now, how the fuck did we end up here?
Now we care about our Instagram posts more than each other
Posting subliminal shit like we ain't never met each other, that's crazy

[Chorus:]
So we go,
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime

[Verse 2:]
We spent the last 24 months arguing over these broads
That we forgot about the show and then Cali became a star
And maybe that was a blessing
'Cause she could grow up to be Reyna Simone at our discretion
I be right there for protection
'Cause these days my kids the only place to get affection
Could be wrong, you a school teacher, maybe I just need correction
You used to be the one to point a nigga in the right direction
Now we both inside Greystone sitting in different sections
Pretending we having fun but what I really want to do
Is get you to that SLS and fuck you till you see the sun
And maybe I wouldn't feel so bad every time I see my son
And he ask am I coming home and I tell him to go ask his mom
And shit get real hard 'cause I can't live without my daughter
You can't just be BeyoncÃ© and try to ride for Sean Carter
You know I love my kids and can't no nigga replace their father
This could be a love story, view the offer right

[Chorus:]
So we go,
I can only try so hard, girl
Remember '95 like our love feel right, girl
And maybe it just wasn't the right time
Maybe in another lifetime


[Verse 1:]
Uh, let Jesus take the wheel of the Phantom, baby!
Close my eyes, wake up, I'm in Atlanta, baby
Who put the magic in Magic City? Lees did!
Who popping Magnum bottles with Diddy? Meek yea!
Tell 'em where the beast is, tell 'em where the beach is
Leaning back on my beach chair, yeah

Niggas don't see me that often in this Rari
But nigga, we're here!
Foreign baby, just like I got a charamon in this back wood
Let it burn, baby! (We make niggas so emotional)
I gotta pull out that hundred foot yacht and poke it with a hose
We in the Poconos, stroking hoes til they open those leggings
Niggas ain't begging, we're getting all the dough
Money over bitches, till I'm fucking Oprah
So, back away from my Phantom, so I can open the door

Rubbing on the bitch tattas she scared of dick, Sci Fi
Hooked her up to that Wi Fi

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What you know about mixing molly with the loud
Hotel smoked out nigga fuck a towel

Every three hours need a re up from the weed man
Afghan purp strand super man head band
Eyes so tight got me looking like Jackie Chan
Me and the Game like Red and the Method Man
Smoking on the roach, you ain't really feeling that dope that you smoked
Try to mix lean with the blunt let it soak
All you gon' do is choke
Niggas can't handle weed from the west coast
Smoke so much till a nigga overdose
I stay high when I'm in and out the booth
Gotta thank Mary for this verse that I wrote
Big buzz in every club don't need a plug I am the plug
Taylor Gang, I'm on the plane
I'm leanin' man, I'm on them thangs
Only strong up in the bong, I've been high for way too long
Codeine I sip, hotbox the whip
I stay throwed, Cheech and Chong

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Game]
Roll kush, fuck hoes, start fights, shoot niggas
How many niggas hurricane done killed, shit quite a few niggas
I'm like two Nas', two Jiggas, two Pacs, two Biggies
Cop the Rari for 250, then made the Rari do 250
Crash the Rari got two Bentleys
Blowing dank like two hippes
Give a nigga bout eight months in the gym
I'm gonna come through looking like two fifties
Half a mill on that xbox
John Madden probably owin' me
Ask Bow Wow, ask Fat Joe, ask Ocho they know me
On that 2k, I od
That C.O.D. you D.O.A
Fuck nigga put your money down
Start worrying bout when the fuck we gon' play
Put six bad hoes in one big room
Stuff six grams in one big blunt
Load six shells in one big pump
Stuff six chickens in one big trunk
Right next to a body, black John Gotti
Like a nigga shotty, hit em with the shotty
Fuck her good once then send her to the lobby
Fuck her so good momma looking for the body
Poppin' mollys and Bugattis, coppin' Mozzys no deposit
Runnin' through the money when a nigga get throwed
Tires screeching when the story get told
So much money that the shit don't fold

[Hook]

Legalized thugging bread like Togo's

R.I.P Lil Frog retired the Polo
Ghost got dust on it bring back the low low
Niggas running up on The Game cause he's solo
I'll beat yo ass like Floyd did Coto

[Verse 8: Problem]
Niggas talk swag I done bought more clothes than them
Can't talk bitches I done fucked more hoes than them
Real with every quote can't stand it with a podium
Smashing coupe his bro To be in

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Game]
Free Boosie
Cause that's what a nigga play when a nigga eat coochie

[Verse 10: Problem]
Her man never wear it out like a box of free stussy

Sick with the dick gotta stan no Tookie
Imagine like she giving me the rookie
Gone on sight like Reese did Roochy
I'm On

[Verse 11: Game]
Carousi body all Gucci
Every nigga wanna eat that up raw sushi
Fine china gold digger 49er
See me with nana the baddest bitches at Benihanas

Swimming in that spade you get ate up by piranhas
Turn yo True Religions into pajamas cause

[Hook]

A nigga went Yeezy in it, north west though
Nigga wanna talk about money? Let's talk
Nigga wanna talk about guns? We'll jump
Nigga wanna run around like you set the razors on fire
You admit it all, your shit popped
Think nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know
Think nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know, think a nigga ain't know

[Hook:]
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga

You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga
You don't wanna know nigga nigga

[Verse 2:]
Nigga talk about cars then I pull out the Aston
When it's Tom Ford then I pull out the plastic
Ridin with a ratchet, totin that ratchet
Murder that pussy, nigga pull out the casket
Bend on a check nigga I ain't gotta cash it
Big around my neck, nigga I ain't gotta flash it
Smoking in the white house I ain't gotta ash it
Never rolled a blunt 'cause my white boy hash it
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
I fucked yo bitch before you got yo dick
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
Million ratchets still eatin half a meal
You ain't even know, you ain't even know
Motherfucker I'm Pablo, in a all black Diablo
Rockin J's like a nigga from Chicago

[Hook:]
You don't wanna know, you don't wanna know me nigga

[Hook x2:]
I just wanna live a little
Smoke a little, fuck a little
Talk the middle, play the middle
Cuz I ainât tryna be nobody else
Nah, I ainât tryna be nobody else

[Verse 1 - AV:]
I ainât tryna be nobody but myself
Why you niggas tryna be like everybody else?
And who the fuck Iâm supposed to call when I need some help?
Nobody, I just play the cards that I was dealt
Say you niggas donât feel my pain
Frustrated with the shit that come with money, causinâ fame
Baby momma on the phone, lil brother on the otha' line
I ainât seen him in a minute, I just need a lil time
I been out here on this grind, tryna make if for my fam
And at the same time, show my mother Iâm a man
I been on my shit goinâ hard in the studio
I know they say itâs takinâ long, at least this shit is movinâ though
Pray for me, Iâmma make it the right way
My way different than these niggas, talkinâ night and day
I was taught to have patience
Now let you let you know whatâs ready for you, itâs waitin'

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Stacy Barthe:]
When I make a couple million, we all rich
When they make a couple million, they all switchinâ
Niggas turn into bitches, bitches turn into hoes
Cuz when you begginâ for fame, I guess this is how it goes
Real niggas be theyself, they neva switch the roads
Fake niggas keep fakinâ till they get exposed
Uh, itâs like we all work the same dreams
But we different, so we donât deserve the same things
Iâm just tryna turn a verse into a million
Without a beach, ya know, just say some shit these niggas feelinâ
Cuz I was down for this shit when you niggas wasn't I made somethingâ outta nothinâ

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Uiie:]
I ainât tryna be nobody else, Iâm tryna get it
Niggas say they wid it, talk that shit but neva did it
Niggas know pops and if they donât check the screen near
Niggas donât trip on my niggas but [?]
Tested and proved it, grabbed a choppa and used it
Pop the violence and use it, to make us wyle out and lose it
As if you dooders recruited, yeah, we was raised up to do it
Tryna survive through the struggles
Some people didnât make it do it
I guess thatâs why I smoke so much
It keep me goinâ Young fly nigga, Iâm about it
Presidential dewey I be blowinâ
Play the cona with the rock, California sprews plowinâ
Iâm just tryna get to this money, ball out like I hit the lotto
Bitches be plottinâ and scheminâ, so TNB is the motto (Trust No Bitch)
All gas on full throttle, stackinâ Mâs for tomorrow
Damn right Iâm bout my motherfuckin' dollas Cuz I just wanna

[Hook]


[Hook:]
These niggas ain't bigger than me

These niggas ain't Em, they ain't 50 to me
You ain't Pun, you ain't Pac, you ain't Biggie to me
These niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me
These niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me
Niggas talking that shit, bout the new generation
Man Fuck these niggas, I'll slash your fucking faces

You niggas ain't sold shit, not an album or a rock
Pussy nigga putting rings on my old bitch
Dick down the throat ass niggas
Old ho' ass niggas
Happy cause you went gold ass niggas
These niggas ain't spitting with me
You ain't sicker than me
Fuck out my section you ain't sitting with me
This for very important people
It's clear that we not equal
Clear you niggas faggots, I'm the black Marshall Mathers
Like "ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
Who needs Hulk Hogan when you got Sting on this motherfucker?
Less than five albums, Kiss the Ring on this motherfucker
California throne and I'm the King on this motherfucker
I don't wanna hear it
Weak ass lyrics
Crying on the hook, thinking we gon feel it
Old lost ass niggas
Voice crack when you talk ass niggas
Rolling blunts for them boss ass niggas

I came in with Ye', Jeezy and boss ass niggas
Your Freshman cover a whole bunch of soft ass niggas
Tampon lyricists, evacuate the premises
Mute BET Cyphers, cause I don't wanna hear that shit
May you Rest in Piss, you fuck niggas
Aye, Frank Ocean go ahead and fuck these niggas (yeah they fuck niggas)
Ain't no 3 stacks in your class
Take your Top 10 spot and shove it up your ass, bitch boy
Niggas already fucked your bitch, you bitch boy
And every time you kiss your bitch you suck my dick, bitch boy
And when you buy that ho a bag that bitch carry my bricks, bitch boy

I was in the Double-XL
Red Chucks round my neck
I was the G in the Unit
Had Buck in my set, word to the rhymes
Had Bust a bust around my set
Gave Who Kid a Glock in case they bust round my set
I'm from Compton
Where the glocc can't fuck with that tech
That's on bompton
40 Glocc got socked in his neck
This a spawn in the flesh
Fuck all these pussys, give me any name to call out
Left Aftermath, Dre told me

Black Marshall Mathers, time to show 'em what it's all 'bout
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker

[Hook]

Eh Frank Ocean go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
"Ying, ying, ying" on a motherfucker
Drop your single, I drop dreams on that motherfucker

The industry soft, I should let Miguel sing on this motherfucker
Ride out
Blood money, we gon' ride out
Ride out
And don't think I won't send six niggas to your hide out
Rich Gang


[Intro - Jeezy:]
'Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up (Damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain't even one way, nigga (Two niggas most)
Stay down and see you come up, nigga, uh
Four songs, nigga (Blood Money, let's go)

[Hook - Jeezy:]
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Man, it's so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how them real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

[Verse 1 - Game:]
Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I'm a tell him ain't nothin' left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight
All they gotta do it wait, tell a nigga I'm a chef
How you think a nigga went and got that race?
Could of went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it's about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put ten karats on my daughter ear, fuck it
She deserved every rock I done sold out in public
Do anythin' for my Destiny's Child
She a BeyoncÃ©, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett
Let the shade fear clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin'
Put on some black on black like here
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the father, she can't even find the gears

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Jeezy:]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don't fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma's kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin' my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I'm 'bout to pull an all nighter
And now I'm 'bout to kill these niggas
So you might not see me 'til tomorrow'
Yeah, like that, then my palms start itchin'
Suede hit the block, then my bong gone missin'
See, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I'm goin' there to buy me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon
My pastor told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said if it is, then I lose my religion

[Bridge - Jeezy:]
If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, "Now, Oprah got a billion dollars
And you know what near her"
Type of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kevin Gates:]
Mayonnaise jaw, straight drop, no whippin'
Electric's off, everything's spoilin' in the fridge
I ain't bathed in a week, house smellin' like pickles
Street showin' no business, still gettin' to the business
Safety pin the zip, break it down, sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
Went flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don't even know a nigga livin' how I'm livin'
I don't even know how many times I've been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call Hot Beezle
Bought two things at the third, I wanna appease you
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that's a nina
Eighteen zaps, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the bag
Real trap talk, keep it real, don't believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I'm a leave you
Dicks cut the water 'fore they kick a nigga door
Tried to flush it down the toilet but the dope just float
Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin', but I ain't never panic
Double homicide, broad day, that's my jacket
Tried to bird feed, cut throat on my jacket
And I take change, I'm a serve when they askin'
Come from out of town, I'm a taste, no relaxin'

[Hook]

[Outro:]
It's okay, Daddy, I'm not scared
I know, baby, the rest of the world is
You ready to go home?
Yes, Daddy
Let's go
Okay


Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there

My father left me when I was 7, at a home
Left me but took his chrome, I looked up and blood was gone
Man, fuck it, guess in the world I'm all alone
My mother was too naive so when he left she followed along
And while you're listenin' to this song, askin' yourself why
It's really none of your business but I was there, I bear witness
To a grow fuckin' man with a bid
Unzipped his pants and I can't tell you what a pig
Me and my sister had different fathers, but I cared, and I loved her
And I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't scared, when he rubbed her
Tip of his penis on her, she was only 11
How could you ever get a boner?
Even thinkin' about it make me hot as a sauna
Make me wanna pop him like the top on Coronas
But I was scared, ran back to my room, prayed to God
That I was dreamin', can't believe I'm this nigga's semen
Livin' with demons and it'd been that way

[Hook:]
Never been so hurt
There was no one to care
(Don't give a fuck about me)
Since my very first breath on Earth
There was no one ever there
(Don't give a fuck about me)

These niggas can't fuck with this shit
I'll make you slit your wrist
This, sort of like the exodus
It's, you see it
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
You see it
It's a bloody moon
The moon bleedin', it's a bloody moon

[Hook]


[Verse 1 - Game:]
I remember days on Crenshaw, take a nigga Beamer
Hit the hood, take his rims off
Then hit that block, let him hear that Pac
That shit don't stop
Soo woo, new coupe, through the west side
New Benz, top down, new rims, new bitch throwin' up P's, whoo whoop

[Hook 1 - Game:]
Compton niggas ain't never gon' be the same
It's in my blood, you see my veins
You see my tats, you feel my pain
You in my hood? You from a gang
You got 2 seconds to answer where you from, or you gon' see your brains
Now that you slumped I see your change

[Verse 2 - Game:]
Nigga we got canals, shelves, niggas that tried, niggas that died
Niggas that fell well, off in their jail cell
Shit, we got niggas with full clips
That dip through you set and disappear like "Hell Rell"
No bail like the peace price
Get caught up in the middle of the street at the light, you fuckin' bean pie
Middle of your forehead nigga, that's where your beam lie
(You be ok) Cause I done seen God

[Hook 2 - Game:]
Niggas sellin' crack, Dre sellin' headphones
2Pac in heaven, bumpin' Biggie "Dead Wrong"
Cherry red Impala, Bible had [?]
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Puff sellin' vodka, weed got my head gone
G-Man in heaven, name on that headstone
LJ in prison, and my nigga Legs gone
I just killed a nigga on my cellphone
Stop that

[Verse 3 - DUBB:]
Playin' chronic, blazin' chronic with the windows tinted
Cause those that don't cut the checks, the ones in yo' business
Rappers sendin' death threats but still ain't sent no killers
You take a stretch [?] squeeze myself, can't depend on niggas
Shit on niggas check the urinal and you'll see
That I be droppin' jewels and you should take 'em like a jewel thief
Wolves teeth is what I use to eat my fuckin' pray up with
Used to make the yayo flip now Game told me to lay your hits
Teamed up, toured the US just to let the name ring
Goin' home to fuck shit up, I did the King James thing
Steak and lobster with the gentleman, sit with a gangster posture
Blowin' all these bands fans, screamin' like it's Frank Sinatra
Made it out the South Bay village homies hate I prosper
But I don't owe you niggas shit, I'm supposed to thank my mama
Only chase for commas, got 'em in now raise the Llama
Hotter than a blazin' comet, fuckin' south central moth

[Hook 2]

The fuck?
Oh shit
[?]
What?
This mother fucker's recording down him sucking a warm dick nigga
You bullshit
Nigga bring your mother fuckin phone, I gotta get this shit on the gram nigga, gotta get my followers up,
I'm gonna blow the internet up with this mother fucker
That bitch on WorldStar nigga
Damn
Push the door open nigga, watch out
Oh the nigga bustin' on [?]
Nasty bitch
Bitch get the fuck out of my house bitch
Nasty bitch
The dead nigga, the mother fucker wolf game head, bitch I dodn't even know Wolves could cum my nigga
Lowkey
Shawty got the best head ever


All I do is get drunk and high
I be fucking nigga's bitches and they be mad as fuck
They be like

[Hook:]
Man fuck you niggas
I rob you niggas
I kill you niggas
Cause I don't feel you niggas
I said fuck you niggas
I rob you niggas
Don't make me kill you niggas
No I don't feel you niggas
Man fuck you niggas

I told niggas in '05 I don;t fuck with Maybachs
You wanna hate up, come outisde, just fuckin' say that
Two things I learned, nigga gotta stayed strapped
And niggas ain't goin' down without a Dr. Dre track
Black boy fly, niggas watch me grew
Niggas studies my beefs and couldn't stomp my flow
(Cause I'm dangerous)
Niggas think they fucking with me
(Stop smoking angel dust)
Niggas think they smoking on this chronic
(The same as us)
Come within (range of us)
Bullets (your brains are bust)
Ministers get shot, two of these niggas (came to us)
You broke your rent doing your bitch want me
I'm off this OG kush and you the lil' homie
Nigga wanna borrow some weed, I got a lil' homie
Watch how I'm driving, can't let the double cup spill on me
Same block and stop snitchin', mother fuckers still one me
G-Unit had a reunion

[Hook]

That's on Compton, you looked in the closet with a monster
I eat you alive (man fuck you niggas)
It feel like Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas I say it again
(Man fuck you niggas)
I feel lke Remy Ma when she got out of the jail
Look back at the prison like (man fuck you niggas)
And this time I'm going for the gusto
R.I.P. Justo, will I fall off? Fuck no
California mind nigga, pull it like a truck boat
These crips, these bloods, these esÃ©s, they playin' cut throat
You a fish out of water, every MC gets slaughtered
If you ain't Nas, Eminem or fuckin' S dot Carter
I tie up your wife, pull out my dick jack it off, kiss the knife
Before I cut her, take my jacket off, fuck her then hit the lights
Rub it in there like Detroit streets, with pictures of me
Fuck her till cops come, then I'm bustin' like

[Hook]


[Hook - DUBB:]
Beast on the loose and my stomach is rumblin'
These niggas out here is food for my stomach
Get the fuck out the way when the lions is comin'
The elephant's stompin', gorillas is jumpin'
The snakes full of venom, the wolves out and huntin'
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo
In this concrete jungle, in this concrete jungle, woo

[Verse 1 - DUBB:]
I sink in my teeth cause these niggas is sweet
Predator to the prey, you should pray for the weak
Spray out Caprices, drive by with the reaper
I hang out the window like I'm an AC
Bodies turn cold after losing your pulse
Turn that dude to a ghost like the homie SP
Yeah, from the LAX with these bars I keep locked
Ain't a prison, I'm free, I can rap in my sleep
Dude on the post with rocks using shots
They come back to your ass like an offensive rebound
Funeral home on the speed dial
When God call your number
Man, trust me, there won't be no re-dial
We out here every day, they acting senile
Year of the wolf, niggas 'bout to hear me out
This beat I'mma wreck while these gorillas beat on their chest
West swing, I'm knocking their trees down
So go in your temple
These niggas is dinner from January all the way to December
Shouldn't have played with my killers

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Skeme:]
Real trill nigga with a hairpin trigger
Iâm surrounded by the killers, I just got it like that
Rappers always talking âyou ainât âbout it like that"
I went out the hood to get it then I brought it right back
Blood money rider, keep the chopper right beside 'em
F&N fully loaded, thatâs for any nigga want it
This sound like I got the shit perfected donât it?
Grab a cartrige, get to sparkin a targetin like all of my opponents
Raise these haters up off of me
Talk some cash when you talk to me
I ainât got no love for you if you ainât getting guwop with me
All my niggas from day one who Iâm gon take to the top with me
And this shotty on me, got that boy walkin so awkwardly
I was raised in the wild with them lions and tigers
Nothing but paper excite us, bitch we were born be fighters
And Iâm from BME, the G in me wonât let me back down
Underground king without a crown, how I sound?

[Hook]


[Intro - Game:]
Me and Tune just got two twin Ferraris

And these bitches be tellin' they niggas I'm crazy
Don't fuck with that nigga, he went at Jay-Z
Then he went at Curtis, now he Patrick Swayze
Every night I got your bitch in my section
I do it at live and I do it at toxic
Do it at supper, I do it at dream
No we ain't at Houston, but I got that Rocket, go!
And I'm feelin' nice, somebody mixed my pills right
And I'm gettin' all this money, and its fucked up Trinidad lost his deal right
No Ceilings! Got the drophead for my children
Dr. Dre just made a billion!
And he sent me to tell all you niggas man

[Bridge x5]

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown:]
Any bitch that I'm with, she just hop in the whip and she get in the grave
Pimpin' is pimpin', I make a commission, they die pussy, pay
My dick like a chopper, I load it then cock it then bust on your face
We know that you pussy my nigga, we know that you ain't catchin' no fades
Bulletproof windows is tinted, my nigga, while all your shit rented
You should rent it from me cause I crash as soon as I spin it
That's why they bring all the bitches
Don't bump the DJ my nigga
You really care 'bout this bitch
My dick all up in your sis

[Bridge x5]

[Verse 3 - Game:]
Started with documents
Reincarnated Pac and Big
How do you think I got your bitch?
I am 2Pacalypse
Got more winners than Popovich
Yeah my bitch will pop a bitch
Pull up like Skrr
Now your bitch out her skirt
I made her twerk
Now she selling my work
Started with Hannah Montana hoes
Now I'm fuckin' all of Nick Cannon hoes
I made her go down down baby
But I don't speak no country grammar though
I got the antidote
I know some Fu-town niggas that'll bust your head like cantaloupe
You pull out your camera my cannon blow
2014 Hannibal
Lil nigga

[Bridge x5]

[Outro - Lil Wayne:]
I fuck yo bitches, fuck yo bitches
Fuck yo niggas, nigga, fuck yo niggas
Soo Woo!


[Verse 1 - Game:]
I got a black mac and a six pack
I don't work out, I don't chit chat
My bitch bad, I get racks
That Rolls Royce, come gift-wrapped
Them birds still come shrink-wrapped
I'm not strapped, don't think that
I'm low key with that click clack
That rat a tat tat tat tat
Throw the burner and I'm runnin' home
Niggas stop being loyal when the money gone
Still walk in this bitch, I'm a hundred strong
One chain on my neck, feel like I got a hundred on
Look at my flow on this bitch
Platinum and gold on my wrist
Money, the accountant be countin' it
That's why I'm throwin' this shit
I'm in BK with that SK
Same clothes since yesterday
With that Biggie Smalls on replay
And I ainât wearing no vest today
I do the Shmoney dance with this mac
You better do it too or get Shmurdaâd
I be grilling that beef, I ainât talkinâ no burgers
I finna be walkinâ like Iâm a New Yorker
I let off the K and then I hope in the Uber
Itâs never a question that I am the shooter
I empty the clip and lay you in a pool of
Blood, see how he got hit with the Ruger?
Blood, bandana thatâs how we be movinâ
Blood, swooping from Compton to Brooklyn
And this ainât the Barclays but niggas be shootinâ

[Hook - Bobby Shmurda x2:]
Running niggas down back and forth
Iâm like pass the torch
Blast it off
Niggas making bets so who gonna blast him off
First to score
We gonâ hit 'em hard
We gonâ hit 'em all
First to score
We gonâ hit 'em all
We gonâ hit 'em hard

[Verse 2 - Freddie Gibbs:]
Running cocaina back and forth
Copped the bag of salt
E S to the G N
Iâm the boss dropped the package off
Coming for the murder, masks is off
Bitch you took a loss
Fuck the DEA we shook âem off
Bitch we shook âem off
Shook and twist the jars
And dope on my mommas stove top
By the time she came back from church boy
I bet you I had an O stocked
In the middle of the muhfuckin' day, no more yayo, boy I done sold out
Nigga pull up in a mothafuckinâ foreign on forgies thatâll bring them hoes out
Like yeah nigga, niggas keep begginâ, I pull out a pump in this bitch like Iâm blizzard
Yeah, empty your pockets, we robbinâ, these bitches got all of us trippinâ
Nigga, itâs better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission
You catchinâ the hollow, Iâm catchinâyou slippin', I did it alone, only God as my witness
My nigga got off cause we tied up the witness, and made sure the nigga couldn't show up in court
You know the business, them niggas find out that you snitchin', them niggas gon' be at your throat
Everyday Halloween niggas will go trick or treatin', with two tweny-three at your door
Flippin' a check off this rappin', go back to the trap and put that in the weed and the blow like

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Skeme:]
I just caught a body like a week ago
These hatin' niggas want attention, I don't see 'em though
You talk that gangsta shit, but I just can't believe it bro
We pull up with them shots, knockin' out that European [?]
S to the K to the E-M-E, callin' here EMT after I empted this clip
I sold my dope right on CMT, I'm at the ING, know I'm as weird as it gets
Chuck Taylor told me it's fuck haters, so I say fuck 'em and bury these niggas in pits
Rolley on wrist, no toc or no tic, your girl on my dick, man come get your bitch
Niggas think this a rap now, I might back down and come try your luck
Riders with me be wired up, they ridin' with me till the tyres bust
Haters talkin', but they better cool it, before that nigga Crooked get fired up
Lay you out like my Balmains, you gotta play 'em straight, he get ironed up
Drinkin' lean till I'm high enough, I don't give a fuck about [?] nigga
I ain't squashin' shit, I won't call it off, I just handle mine like a man nigga
I'm on frontline with these bands nigga
Need a chair, I can't stand niggas
We do walk-by's and hop outs
Got slidin' doors on that van nigga

[Hook x2]


[Introduction - King Marie:]
So, close
But so, far away

[Hook - King Marie:]
I just wanna be a dreamer
I just wanna be a king
I just wanna give us
I just wanna be me, 
I just wanna be free
I just wanna be 
I just wanna be 
I just wanna be 

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Put on my Dre Beats when I don't wanna hear the world talkin'
The walls closing in, the studio feel like a coffin
But I resurrect myself every time like I'm Jesus
Rather walk on water in the streets niggas dying for Yeezy's
Niggas sleeping outside for them J's know how it feel to be homeless even if its just for a day
Some of us bow our heads down when we pray, some of us bow our heads down so you can miss us with a stray
I grew up with DeSean let that young nigga play
Turn to run a slant let the bullet fly Zimmerman's way
I did it Eminem's way, when I was sitting with Dre
It was Aftermath or die then, Busta told me ride in
Snoop told me if you a dragon go spit that fire then
Game of thrones, I made my home inside that lion's den
And all my enemies I don't know where to find them
But me I got like nine in

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Stat Quo:]
The son of Maya Angelou and Martin Luther
But my daddy was a crackhead, my mom was a booster
Born in the belly of Medusa with the killers and the three time losers
These cops pursue us, thug gangs recruit us, to carry on some torch, they were taught, would improve us
As the system maneuvers, they just feed us manure
They living in paradise, we shoot it out in the sewer
I call myself Stat to remind myself not to be a statistic
As the kush get twisted my consciousness get lifted
We party with devils, digging graves with dull shovels
Diamonds on my bezel my grind on some other level
I'm subtle but won't settle, all black clothes
They say Stat you too ghetto, my pen wrapped in turbans
My bombs, bass and treble
Fell asleep in hell, I woke up living my dreams
I'm a rebel

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - SAP:]
I just wanna be a
Dreamer, I see all these things with my eyes closed
Woke up to reality, actually in fly clothes
Life is such a gamble, I'm proof that the odds roll
So anything we planning we do it colossal
Hurt people that I know was dreamers, which means that just makes my grind meaner
Let me turn my rhymes into a time machine and remind the people
How dope these lines can be when you're tryna reach the higher league
You seem to bleed through the soul to the choir speakers
I am preaching, to the younger nigga I used to be
And usually it's just inspiration that you can use to be
Bigger than the world in a world where you are user free
But still you live off of so much more than what you used to see
But who the fuck am I kidding, this shit is even new to me (word)
I got with Game, I got in the game, and I could chew a piece of this fresh cooked filet, I could eat it every day
But I swear this the beginning, I be dreaming every day

[Hook]


Uh, yeah, it's that Westside shit
It's for the '99 and the 2000s, nigga
I ain't flyin' with none of you niggas
The new Cash Money
The gang that don't pay, biatch
Right

[Hook:]
I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad whores
I get mad more, nigga
I got mad flows, mad flows
The shit that got me mad dough
I get mad more, motherfucker

Black Benzes, windows tinted, no, my shit ain't rented
Inglewood [?] fuck a nigga and his [?]
Hot boy, nigga, make a million while I'm chillin'
I could bet a pretty penny you ain't livin' what you spittin'
Go up where the thugs burnin', see the cash when I'm grinnin'
Montana shit, Medusa head stitched in my linen
Street nigga, no account, your account in my denim
Unless you blind, bitch, it ain't hard to see a nigga winnin'
If I'm talkin' to that ho, then tell that bitch to pay attention
Big business, I use dollar signs to punctuate a sentence
Fuck the law, do it raw, skip the trial and drop the witness
Bein' broke been a joke, ain't shit funny 'bout my digits?

[Hook]

Strap on, get clapped on, nigga, that just be the facts
They say "Me, I don't rap though", got [?]
Got my chopper on, my stack of Os
Then came back with the sack
Man, my Roley, that's goldie, my wrist nicknamed "The Mack"
See, your niggas ho-niggas and that shit they be [?]
Man, my niggas be killers, give a fuck about rap and beats
See, my bitches got bitches, my pimpin' game is sweet
They have you fuck 'em, then duck 'em
Man, get right back in the streets
Bitch, I've been a threat, ghetto intellect, AK and a TEC
Nigga flex, labels sendin' checks, still I'm in a set
Nigga rich, use this Internet, we ain't feel it
Play with me, I'm a play for keeps, all my niggas strapped

[Hook]

This my world now, nigga, you just livin' in it
Cause I got [?] on my face, made my vision different
By any means necessary, no, your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no, you fuckin' didn't
Say, this my world now, nigga, you just livin' in it
You get some money, nigga, can I make your vision different?
By any means necessary, no, your nigga get it
He said he got it like we got it, no, you fuckin' didn't

[Hook x2]


[Verse 1 - Game:]

See that black Ghost? It's getting scary in this motherfucker
Sittin' on a hill son, carryin' this motherfucker
Red guts, popped a cherry in this motherfucker
I got that White boy, Barry in this motherfucker
And I got Homes nigga, Larry in this motherfucker
See you on them cameras, Jason Terry in this motherfucker
If gay is happy, I'm Tyler Perry in this motherfucker
House in the water, need ferry to this motherfucker
And I got cheese, thinkin' dairy in this motherfucker
More gold bottles than you can carry in this motherfucker
Peach Ciroc, Red Berry in this motherfucker
Let me see you shake it for a real nigga
She gone think she in a fairy tale once that pill hit her
Even though she out of her mind, I'm a to deal with her
Might let Drizzy Drake, French, and Meek Mill hit her

[Hook - Sam Hook:]
I met her, fucked her, fell in love with her
Left but came back, still in love with her
She is married to the Game

[Verse 2 - French Montana:]
Married to the Game nigga
Got them Birds, Larry in this motherfucker
And you know we legendary in this motherfucker
Doors suicide, Hail Mary in this motherfucker
Montana, ask a motherfucker
Show you why I live you need a dictionary ass motherfucker
Yeah, niggas hating on this motherfucker
Got the glove on, Gary in this motherfucker
Delonte West, motherfucker
Fuckin' with Game in the west, like a motherfucker
Even though shorty crazy, might deal with her
Might like Drake, Game, Meek hit her, Montana

[Hook - Sam Hook]

[Verse 3 - DUBB:]
LA on my back, I'm tired of carryin' this motherfucker
Niggas chasin' racks, Tom & Jerry in this motherfucker
Long nose revolver, Dirty Harry in this motherfucker
Way a nigga drew, you'd think Carey this motherfucker
Game and French killed it but I'm buryin' this motherfucker
First off the label, January in this motherfucker, nigga
You get Shmurda'd in this motherfucker
At this park, get killed over a burger in this motherfucker
Get away car, a nigga swervin' in this motherfucker
Mom's kicked me out, a nigga servin' in this motherfucker
Beard and a chopper, need a turban in this motherfucker
Put you on Iceman, George Gervin in this motherfucker
Out of Cognac, I'm sippin' Bourban in this motherfucker
Enemies strippin' in black Surburbans in this motherfucker
Power steerin' gone, how I'm turnin in this motherfucker?
Intercepting hoes, Richard Sherman in this motherfucker

[Hook]

[Outro]


[Verse 1 - Game:]
Look stop going through my cellphone
(Please), bae trippin', I don't know what the hell wrong
Bae dippin' she on some shit
I got her Louis luggage packed for the longest trip
I'm like girl, you ain't my baby mama (no), you ain't my girlfriend (no)
All up in the club, niggas tryna fuck
Holdin' bottles up, get you caught up in that whorlwhind
I text her like "King what you doing?"

[Hook - King Marie:]
I'm in the club feeling nice, I'm on one
(I hate that I ever met you, I hate that I ever met you)
Boy when I drink with you, I'm on one
Damn it boy I hate you so much
(I hate that I ever me you)

[Verse 2 - King Marie:]
You can blame yourself, for doing it to me
Damn I hate you so much, got me feeling like Kelis
Yeah, there's so many girls, to my left and my right
If I get one more drink, I'mma switch to the other side

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ty Dolla $ign:]
In the club feelin' nice, she bet I roll the dice
She give me that wet wet, I give her this pipe ooh
I fly her out when I be out of town
Fuck her in the room with the speakers loud, yeah
She give me head on the highway
She say her favourite position is sideways
Found out she ain't the only girl
Sent me staright to the voicemail
I text her with a "fuck you at?"
She hit me with

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Game:]
I know
You a dime piece, but I ain't no side piece
And who this other nigga? Cause I got my side piece
And I got my side chick, replacement killers
This baby sittin' Versace
You hate me bitch, but wish you sittin' beside me
In the 'Gatti, feelin' like Irv when I swerve
Watch me murder the curb
Bet it murder your mind, she got words for you birds

[Hook]

I thought you loved me?! You was my baby! My fuckin' cinnamon apple! My rose!
You was always there for me! And you wanna leave me for some fuckin' dumb ass nigga?! For some dumb nigga!


[Intro - Too $hort:]
Don't fight the feelin'
That's right, don't fight the feelin'

[Interlude - The Game:]
Say, my life is like a movie, nigga, fuckin' every day
Fuckin' every day, nigga, fuckin' every day
Say, my life is like a movie, nigga, fuckin' every day
Missionary, doggy style, nigga, fuckin' every way, go

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
I'm not the nigga you thought that
That trickin', we off that, I hit that, no fallback
She ratchet, I like it, I hold it, she bite it
She lick it and suck it, I fuck it, he wife it
No feelings for a ho that ain't my main thing
My niggas on the same thing, all my niggas gang bang
Bitches do choke, this is my boo
Two C's on that bag but she throw a Piru
And we off that CÃ®roc, she don't mind it I do
Her girlfriend a thot, tell her hop in my coupÃ©
Tell her hop in my bed, tell her hop off my roof
My baby-mama trippin' and that bitch can shoot but

[Hook - The Game:]
You gon' let me hit or nah?
[King Marie:]
"Can I get the dick or nah?"
You gon' let me watch you strip or nah?
[King Marie:]
"Can a bitch get a fit or nah?"

[Bridge - Eric Bellinger:]
Girl, once you get it, you got it forever
Oh, nah, so let me hit it
Girl, once you get it, you got it forever
Oh, girl, so let me hit it

[Verse 2 - Eric Bellinger:]
If you let a nigga come through
I'm give it to you better than you ever had it
Girl, I promise, I'm a be the only thing you want to do
Makin' you forgot about your niggas automatic, you already know
I can fuck you better, can we live together?

[Verse 3 - Problem:]
Bitch a problem, bitch, you better follow me
I give you this dick, you hit the lottery
I know all the stars, astrology
Last deposit fucked up the whole economy
Get that, spent twenty-ten, bitch-nigga
Kush, piff in it, every white string infinite
You different, last night, niggas picturin'
Seven times, had a black chick tryin' white shit
Federline, I'm the future, real beef, I'll shoot you
Walk-walk, no talk-talk, no sub and no woofers
It's on, tell by my tone
Real nigga call, better answer your phone

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 4 - AV:]
You gon' be a nigga's bitch or nah?
You gon' let a nigga hit or nah?
What you sayin', know you're with it so why you playin?
Bitch, you better fuck a rich nigga while you can
I be on one, two C's for the city
I'm on, I got Crip and Blood niggas with me
Wait up, just tell me you with it and let me get it
Baby, you can skip the bullshit and let me hit it
Three pills down, got me rollin' like Nip
Keep playin' games but you know that you a flip, hold up
Bitch, quit playin' and give it up
You gon' let a nigga hit or what? What's up?

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro - Too $hort:]
Don't fight it baby

Your pussy wet? Take them panties off
Don't fight it, let a nigga hit that shit
You like to fuck, all these bitches love fuckin'


[Verse 1 - Yo Gotti:]
Fuck buyin' jewelry, buyin' ammo
Teflon, bulletproof the Lambo
Hate rats, got my niggas in the fed
Got money in the bank and money on my head
Really? Niggas sound silly
Wanna talk money, yeah, count it, ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga Better Google me
Boy, I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy, I had a white car back in '04
Back in runnin' wood days and ride low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you, nigga?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer
Nah, LA Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the 'jects empower the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz:]
My auntie did 20 years, my pop did like 16
My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really, ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, no tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, dinner fork
Often offended, I told that bitch to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends
That's what it is, verbal telekinesis
Korrupt mixed with Jeezy, Big Meech mixed with Yeezus
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers, started talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter
Niggas ain't killing shit, niggas they playing
They saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And the shit here might burn a little bit
I'm like, "Really, little bitch, say really"

[Hook - Soulja Boy:]
Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me

[Verse 3 - T.I.:]
Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cop 'round
Nigga I don't give a fuck, motherfucker, act up
Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on guard
They act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my.44 in the door
I'm not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, know we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes and shoot you
You'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, a nigga got my moolah off top
He don't give me my moolah, off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Game:]
Niggas ain't gon' kill shit
I'm ridin' 'round, 7 pounds, nigga, Will Smith
It's a whole heck of y'all and a whole deck of cards
This shit right here you can't deal with
Two ice cubes and some cognac
Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5'9's
Leave all you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight through your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuck dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Moe around
And when a nigga say "Timber", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Go A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket you bastard 
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over
Soulja!

[Hook]


[Verse 1 - Tyga:]
Yeah, so what they want from a nigga?
Rose on fours, yeah, broad in this bitch ice skating big figures
My day one niggas, weak game bitches
Downing all this hate and you wonder why a nigga trippin'
Enemies distant, you washed up, dry dishes
Versace in my kitchen, my shit different
Hundred grand, bet it on it, caviar with the jet pilot
I land runway, they light it, world united
Gave her this dick, she gon' like it
Just don't bite it and politely
Say she need me like an ID, but I be outtie
Five thousand, gold Audi

[Verse 2 - Pharaoh Jackson:]
You are, you are, you are so special to me
I wanna come home to you, I wanna make love to you
But I gotta get this cheese
Girl, I know you like that
Tell me anything you want and I'mma get that for you
Got me thinking I'mma wife that
Your girls and my niggas know that I ride for you
Ooh, ooh, girl keep shaking them hips for me
Ooh, ooh, girl, keep biting them lips

[Hook - Pharoah Jackson:]
And I just don't wanna waste your time
Don't wanna waste my time

[Bridge - Pharoah Jackson:]
Girl, what you want from me?
Oh oh, yeah, work it, get this money
Get this money
Girl, what you want from me?
Oh, I'm coming, be there in a hurry
Hurry, be there in a hurry

[Verse 3 - Pharoah Jackson:]
You can scream if you want to, dream if you want to
Take that Maserati, try the Beam if you want to
Get you a ring cause I want you, you're mine
It ain't nothing that I won't do for you
Leave all these other girls alone just for you
So every night I'm coming home just for you
Ain't nothing more you can prove to me
I love everything that you do to me
Ooh, ooh, girl keep shaking them hips for me
Ooh, ooh, girl, keep biting them lips

[Bridge]

[Outro - Pharoah Jackson:]
Take that, shake that
Take that, can't fake that


[Stacy Barthe:]
We are dying, we are dying
Are we gonna die? Are we gonna die?
We are dying

Light a blunt, throw on Nas, collect my thoughts
Blow the candles out as I contemplate in the dark
Dumpin' ashes on the fuckin' Time magazine
Tryna burn a hole between Israel and Palestine
All this world news, all these dead bodies
All these kids dying, the talk of illuminati
As I'm murderin' ink, I get a call from Irv Gotti
Say "Keep spittin' cause when you do it's like a 12-gauge shotty
Got machetes and them cannons loaded up
Got them Xany's and that lean in my cup
These politician's can come up missin', I'm on a mission
You hear them gun shots, now mother fuckers listenin'
Feel that you can take their life cause they ain't got a pot to piss in
Raise the Christian, kill you for these kids as victims
Fuck the system
You give a kid 30 cent and think you sponsor somethin'?
I feed a village by myself nigga Compton comin'
Purge

[Hook - Stacy Barthe (Game):]
We are dying, we are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying
(Sometimes I wanna purge)
We are dying, some times I gotta purge
(Sometimes I wanna)
We're living on a purge
(Sometimes I wanna)

What if we ran through Beverley Hills, got 70 kills
Ridin' down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills
And pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle
And shot one, Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz
I got one, beam on the back of his dome
Palm sweaty on the back of the chrome
That's my adrenaline
So we purge Sandusky, purge Zimmerman
Purge every mother fucker rapin' women in
Purge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans
Me and my mercenaries, middle of South Sudan
Carryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands
Long as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep
We purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now
Crash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down
298 innocent lives severed
Flyin' on Aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven
And so we Purge

[Hook]

Imagine going to the stores without cops harrasing
Imagine Mike Brown walkin', them same cops just passed 'em
I'm smokin' hash, and let me ash it before I talk in past tense
I hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges
2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion
Thinkin' 'bout his casket in this Phantom, swear I almost crashed it
That's why I'm headed to Ferguson with this German luger
Cause I'm probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther
More like Ice T than Ice Cube, I'm a cop killer
Murder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'
On my knees prayin', wish my nigga Pac was livin'
But he fell victim to the Rampart Division, purge
Cops killed Biggie, cops beat up Rodney King
We tore up the city nigga, purge
Or just stand there like J. Cole and shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed, purge

[Hook]

This song is dedicated, to my engineer Jus' wife, Carey Jean who passed away June 28th at 1.45 pm to stomach cancer, 2 days before his son Harlem's 11th birthday. Crazy how he mournin' his wife's death and I'm celebrating my son's life. I'll never understand death, shit. Sometimes it's a struggle to understand life, shit crazy. I'll never understand. Can't stop fightin' to survive though, but what we fightin' for when we eventually all die though, purge. Eventually we all victims of the purge. Us killers, what's keepin' us alive. It's a question nobody got the answer to. So PURGE!


[Hook - Jake&Papa:]
Killers hanging outside the windows, aye
Oh my, oh my, I got trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
I know my enemies run when that pistol shake
Nah, nah, nah, nah, I got trouble on my mind, trouble

[Verse 1 - DUBB:]
It's a stolen G ride whenever we ride
It's war where we reside so I gots to keep my
Pistol close, even cops killing folks
Give their ass the whole magazine, fuck a centerfold
Sixteen with it, ho, one in the chamber
Mask on my face so I remain a stranger
Death round the corner run inside when we pull up
Learn the negotiations, how you talking to a bulldog?
Blap, blap, blap - what you hear when them shots go off
Devil on my shoulders told me squeeze my Glocks on y'all
Only the angel that I seen was the logo on the fitted
I'm a seven black nigga, all my enemies'll get it
Bloody rag wrapped around my motherfucking tech
Snoop "Murder Was The Case" what was playing in the deck
How else could I live my life
When yesterday's promise turn to present day's lies?
With the

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - DUBB:]
Yeah, fuck shooting brothers for the color of their rag
I'm shooting at the niggas with the badge
Catch you walking out the station, that's your ass
Nigga, that's for Mike Brown, pussy, that's for Eric Garner
Pig, that's for Sean Bell, die from these nine shells
Go against the SWAT team, meet us at the swap meet
Bloods and Crips together, peace treaty like it's '93
They the real enemies, they the ones that killing me
Killing you, they killing us, judges don't do shit for us
Cops kill a nigga, bet they'll never get a sentence huh
Get promoted right after getting off suspension
What the fuck is this world coming to?
Unarmed black kids, they putting guns at you
That's been happening for years so that's nothing new
Got me sick to my stomach, fuck a stomach flu
Tell captain or the police that we coming through
With troops that ain't scared to die and they love to shoot
Some out the roof, it sunk

[Hook]


[Intro]
Long awaited!! Most anticipated
We back again; as we welcome you
To the Republic, of Cali-for-ni-a
{DJ SKI, The Game, California Republic mixtape}
{Long awaited, droppin Thursday - BITCH!!}

[Chorus]
My bills are paid
And everything's okay
It's like every day
Summertime in L.A.

[The Game]
Yeah; I'm from Compton, home of the fiends
Home of the monsters, home of triple beams
...Home of the shattered fuckin dreams
Where most niggaz I grew up with ain't make it to see they teens
Ain't no Freddy, ain't no Jason, but niggaz too scared to dream
And they rippin pages out of them books 'bout Dr. King
You don't wanna know half the shit I seen
where readin a magazine get you hit with a magazine
Niggaz ain't scared to murder cause the jails too packed
Kill a nigga, he be out before the "R.I.P." tat
I seen Raider snapbacks by Starter
Then I seen Dre make that Sox hat harder
Then I seen Makaveli go at Shawn Carter
Then I seen that block where B.I.G. got slaughtered
Then I knew it was my callin, G the fuck up or die ballin
Lace them red Chucks up, but die fallin

[Chorus]

[Nipsey Hussle]
Yo! Let's go
I'm risin in this game and it feels great
Still tryin to keep it real, niggaz still fake
...I'm so impatient, but I still wait
Dropped "The Marathon" in November, niggaz still late
...[intentionally long pause]
...Still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, need a high heel eight
Or better, blowing this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever, I'm in to win til this movie ends
Smoking California, eating Peruvian
Out on Miami Beach, my niggaz a few of them
Just like Beverly Hills, the bitches we usually wear
From wishin on a star, nigga took it far
And if I lost it all to war, I wouldn't trip at all
Look; it sound crazy when I say it
But the fear of fallin off is the only thing that could take it
We straight

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I got my hoodie on, it's a Starter
I'ma rock this muh'fucker for Trayvon Martin
I'ma rock this muh'fucker for Trayvon's daughter
that he coulda had; where's his killer at? The whole hood is mad
That ain't the first time, won't be the last
See reflections of my past, while I guzzle through this glass
Make me want to run up on you with the muzzle, "Where the cash?"
Retaliation is none, niggaz can't afford the gas
Got a mansion in the Hills, Rottweilers by the gates
Red Ghosts in the driveway and ducks by the lake
Spending time with my daughter so them ducks gotta wait
Let a nigga call it a duck, he gon' eat a thirty-eight
I'm supposed to be this fuckin rich
I'm supposed to be this fuckin great
I'm a (Menace II Society), no Larenz Tate
but me and my niggaz straight and

[Chorus]


Ayo Game, what they do boy

We knowing how I be banging

And I kill 'em with the bounce, you see the way a nigga steppin
And we pop bottles and we rock J's, see me reppin'
Let me show you way I do it before I hit you with the weapon
Don't be spillin' liquor all over my shit, give me a second

Probably feelin' models up
Let me wrap a bottle up
Let me see everybody put your liquors bottle up

Bitches, I'm gettin money, bottles and rocking chains
Money like I'm LeBron, my whip collection insane
Suicidal thoughts, highway to heaven riding like a boss
Condominium in the clouds, 60G's a month

Make pretty girls do the ugly face
And they just my song on
Move back I need dougie space like ay, ay
Then it's right back to my muggin' face
Niggas saying put the weed out

We walked in, want somethin', bottles pop like we won somethin'
Raise a glass for everybody that's done something from nothin'
No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind

But tonight we on that Red Berry and Cranberry, Soo Woo

And I'm smokin' on that purp
Sippin' on that purp
I came in this bitch with some niggas that will murk
And we ain't bout all that talkin', you a dead man walking
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordan's
Got a scope on the barrell that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer

Uh-huh; I need a gangster bitch nigga I ain't lyin
I'm talkin when I fuck she scream, you hear sirens
No domestic violence (violence)
Just domestic dominance
So let me ice you out so when you slidin down the pole
Doin your Magic City thing yo' neck and wrist glow
I'm dreamin, she ain't a stripper, she a classy girl
Gon' off that Patron, she my nasty girl
First name Rachal, last name Jones
You related to Nas? Girl, Queens my second home
You know you, (Prince Akeem) come with a (Semi) we can tear it up
Weekend in Cannes, then we (Coming to America)

Never been to A-T-L but she love that (Gucci) (brrr!)
She taught me how to cook Cajun, I taught her how to cook crack
And I chopped it on her back, now tell me where they do that?

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I put her on a Greyhound, she know she better stay down
Ride or die like my Bentley man this bitch'll never break down
She my "Bust It Baby," you should see her bust a trey pound
Love Roc-A-Fella so much she won't even call me Jay now
She roll my weed man, like she my wingman
Then we get high, play Tiger Woods on that weed damn
Love is four season, haters 365
In the game cats and dogs, keep your bitch by your side
Got a hardtop Lambo' when the rain start to pour
Not the rain outside, talkin the rain indoors
Her girlfriend told her, that I was creepin with a stripper
Told her I was courtside, watchin the whack ass Clippers
Bitch please! I'm a Laker fan, and Kobe that's my nigga
Keep my grass cut so I can see when the snake slither
Shit came out of nowhere like Khloe and Lamar
Kinda got a nigga thinkin maybe I'm

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I let her drive the Range on our first date
She the first one to put me on that Drake mixtape
"I just wanna be successful baby"
Take you out them Hudson Jeans and redress you baby
We can walk down Rodeo, turn around, you on Melrose
Fly to New York in the winter and try on some Timbos
Or we can hit South Beach, fuck with Ross and Timbo
The world is cherry pie and we can (Slice) it up like (Kimbo)
You cook the rock, I break it down, I wrap it up, you weigh them pounds
I make the car, you start the car, we can drive it out of town
I'm your nigga right? And you my bitch (yeah)
Even if they lock me up, she gon' get them brakes there
When we get tired, we hit the truck stop and sit there
And zip my 501's and, she gon' put her lips there
The memoirs of a perfect bitch
You gotta hold them down even if it's

[Chorus]


[Hook: Drake]

My nigga funeral Fab told be back in â03

And I know I promised my niggas Iâd never leave the block
But, shit changes
I done been through six Ranges
Hand on the Eagle, yeah I got them Mike Vick fingas
Throwinâ bullets on par with the accuracy
Hit your whole faculty, like, ainât nobody jackinâ me
Before you do, you be layinâ in a box
While Jay kiss that ass goodbye, (mwuah), Lox
First shot, leave the niggas in shock
That second shot, thatâs when that body drop (Ya heard me?)
And niggas still askinâ âbout Detox
Iâll tell you if you tell me who killed Pac
Aight then, Iâm at this Pacquiao fight then, with Tyson
The way heâs stickinâ, and movinâ the knife, Floyd might win

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lifestyle]
Testarossa, keep an extra toaster

Sittinâ courtside with Drake, Hector and Rondo
Bitches know my name, itâs Lifestyle, she fuck with that
Dick too big, like my lifestyle, you fuck with that?

At the Ronald Reagan airport, yeah, Iâm on my shit

Get banged on like the treble makes
The dumb mistake tryin to jumpin with blake
These niggas in my lane
Lob city in these streets
Jesus piece on my chain
need God with me in these streets
I went through hell to get to where heaven is
Lucy in that red dress lookin devilish
Scale a 1 to 10 she lookin elevenish
If she ain't ridin shotty AK 47 is
Shorty came to me when she left her man
I looked at her and said you sumthin else
But the best way to get over sumbody
Is gettin under sumone else
On that note I'm in that 1,2,3 pin that
Baby tellin me I'm the best I b yellin I been that
In the club half a pill and a full clip
Get a deal on a Rose no bullshit

[Game]
There goes ghost

My chic walk around wit that bronco
Extend the clip in that conso

Ridin around wit that Houston rocket
Keep all that of that Jeremy lin shit in yo pocket

[Chorus 2x]

[Slim Thug]
I'm goin back to cali

Couple pounds of that kush I ain't the only one getting wasted
Smoke a lil, sell the rest Ima hustla baby

Strapped up got extra armor

If you see a fake nigga point em out (point em out)

[Chorus]


Need y'all to understand what I'm 'bout to do
Keep it gangsta in this Lou Vuitton designer shoes
Front of club, live stuntin' in that Masi coup
Then we gonna check China, see what king of diamonds do
Pass the kush that a y'all when I will climb the roof
That nigga get down for me like I bought to shoot
Tell him it's money thing, my nigga signed a grill
The kid rabbis, running trains like a monorail
Introduce you to my team, niggas you need to know
We pop the spades, the bottle look like C3PO
Blowing that last security, telling us to keep it low
But when you pay me for a walkthrough this is what you need to know
We're smoking all night, kid got a handle for me
to tell the owner that twelve bottles is mandatory
And we gon need a few Ciroc and them gooses too
Shane go for green house and dream down to Houston too
Watch Himalaya eating shrimps while I throw these ones
Jas drunk as fuck cause every time I look he show his gun
Every time we in the strip club he got the coldest one
Surrounded by killaz cause jade prince know his son
And I'm all 'ight with that cause rap a lot my fam
And every time he asks me can I dot dot? Yea, I can
Cause he been looking out for me before the trade co sign
And I was there with him and 2 when they heard that Drake's gon sign
But look at Drake now. Every time I need some he'd do it and say
Game hawl if you need some
And that's loyalty in the industry that's full of snakes
When niggas send a bottle to your table just to show their face
And bitches stand there looking pretty just to get a glass of ace
Most of these hoes dumb and they nothing but a ass and face
But if you are the one that's lucky enough to stand up on this couch
Make sure soon as we hop in that Phantom you got them titties out
I hate you fake hoes, I swear I hate you fake hoes
Your fake ass, your fake nose, you're never gon be J Lo
Nicki put you on that mike, Carl's got you thinking that you on the right
Cause the fuck that nigga in that white Porsche
But I got news for ya: got a wifey and three kids at home
And I can't even start to count how many times we've been to Rome
My oldest get his tennis on, my youngest got his tennis on
And you ain't never seen a four year old swaging in his farms
Now they wanna be him cause he rocking coliseums
Used to rock it for the fiends, now he rock with Europeans
All out and doubling with them green bottles bubbling
Twins I call double men calling me by my government
I swear to God that I'm loving it, I'm on the beach with Miss Dominican Republic
Even she's surprised that she's sucking it
But don't be surprised that I'm fucking
Never cuff and always puffing, these bitches know who they fucking with
I'm the fucking shit, handsome ass nigga
Fuck with me, I fuck with her
You don't need ransom cash nigga
Now cancel that nigga like my Blackberry service
Don't believe none of you niggas till the plaque start surfacin'
Niggas get nervous when we hop at them suburbans
Get the time wearin' rags around our heads like they're turbans
Half them niggas murking, I'm behind them Phantom curtains
Heading to grace though, my alibi is this Persian
Her alibi is this Asian, I call that a persuasion
From Hollywood lock-up to yelling out Brenda Spencer
Dumb bitch right here wanna know why the bottle green
I'm something like them golf niggas, I have seen a lot of green
Six hundred forty mill, about to play the lottery
A rich can't play twice, don't lie to me
Cause a donut trunking fish like they eye to me
Ain't no lemon spending this money, I'm bout it bought it B
I'm hoodie's new rapper's try to be
Every new nigga that say fire becomes a prodigy
And you should honor me, and my jersey up short
We got a situation, nigga Jordan's
You don't know about my occupation nor about fucking these hoes
Nor I rock these Loubrettons and smoke till it's stuck in my toes
And I got your girl in the comfortable clothes
I'm 'bout to take her lower what's right a point than my nose
It's money gang bitch, now watch my company blow
And go from a hot logo to something you know
I'm in that Maseratti, Jordan's punching the floor
And you can act like you don't nigga, but...

Even I'm going too fast, I'm doing too much
Shine it down all the time when I'm in the club

Yea, I'm always in the zone
Chilling with a bad bitch and she got nothing on
Yea I'm on the due to shut it down
Yea, I'm going too fast, so fast

Going so fast, see, going so fast
Going too fast, so fast
Going too fast
God speed, it's like going too fast
So fast

Yea, I'm always in the zone
Chilling with a bad bitch and she got nothing on
Yea I'm on the due to shut it down
Yea, I'm going too fast, so fast

God speed
Going too fast
God speed, God speed
Said I'm going too fast, so fast


She say she got it man but I ain't gonna try to hit that though
I'm just tryna get you naked and it'll only take a second
But she ain't tryna hit that though
She with her girlfriends and she like me so we textin'
Her ass as big as Texas so behind her back we sexin'
And I swear this girl impressin' cause I just got rid of my X and
Had to find me a different direction
I should state it all in my section
Last week kept a nigga off stressin'
But now the man moves to the next chick
And I'm spendin' this money on alcohol and I feel it's a good investment
Cause I got you and your girlfriends over that stinger
Reminiscin' 'bout the good times, they dreamin'
You gon need just some good wine, fallin' tears
Talkin' 'bout who's really down, girl, standup comedian
Now he hand her next nigga her iPhone
But ain't really takin' that personal
You got bottle scum and you're the first to know
You're the first queen that the world know

Let it back girls, let it back girls
Them Loubrutton, Louis, Gucci, break it down girls
Let it back girls, let it back girls
Don't be stuck on hit, pop the cap girl
(It can't hurt) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(I wanna see you sweat) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl

She from Indiana but she don't like them Pacers
She moved out here for a model scene
So I got 'er chearin' for them Lakers
She a bad girl, you know how I like 'em bad girls
Tryna get the keys to the Porsche truck
But you know I don't like them fast girls
(Yo) Slow down for me
Throw it to the front then bring it back to me
Hit her girlfriends while I watch how she do me
Make 'er wanna get another magnum out of that Louis
If she don't get I'm a hit it all night
Smack it on the left then slide on the right
Think it to myself this pussy tight
She wanna go again, she just my type
She sexy and I like her
The red bottom, I spiked 'er
Keep pullin' these all-nighters
And I might just go ahead and wife 'er
We shot been, a rodeo
I love this girl, I swear lord
Can't wait to get 'er back to the hotel room 
cause you know we gon get up that head porch
She turn it, let it back girls

Let it back girls, let it back girls
Them Loubrutton, Louis, Gucci, break it down girls
Let it back girls, let it back girls
Don't be stuck on hit, pop the cap girl
(It can't hurt) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(I wanna see you sweat) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl

I see a girl with the coach bag
She makes you foul
Need a referee in her cause she'd know she'd foul
And I know that gotta be the same girl
And I can't get domino plane girl
All the bad bitches up in her
Feel bad for you if you came with your man, girl
And I ain't tryna know your name girl
If you can't fuck with it, that ass got a leak
And I don't know who you came with
Cause you're not gettin' in here with all that weed
You know good and well who I'm talkin' too
No fake shit and I mean that
And your ass been over there hatin' all night
You know damn well I've seen that so

Let it back girls, let it back girls
Them Loubrutton, Louis, Gucci, break it down girls
Let it back girls, let it back girls
Don't be stuck on hit, pop the cap girl
(It can't hurt) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(I wanna see you sweat) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl
(Pop it, pop it) Gone ahead, pop the cap girl


[Verse 1: The Game]
Wake up in the morning feeling like a G
Got them number fours on my feet
And the Lakers just beat the Heat
Clippers beat the Knicks, think it's about to be a good week
Yeah I'm rich forever, you know I got them good seats
Now let's hit up Greystone, get our fuckin' Ace one
Know I'm in the VIP, throwin' back straight 'tron
Goons with me 'case we gotta get our fuckin' ape on
Nigga playin' Superman, better have that cape on
My niggas pop up outta nowhere, State Farm
But I'm cool in [?], play them Drake songs
And bring it back to the west side, play them "A" songs
Cause little mama know, we're only in here for one night...
A week though, and watch out for them wolves
Dressed up in them sheep clothes
And she don't really club, but I bet that ass a freak though

[Hook: Sam Hook (The Game)]
We're only in here for one night (a week though)
We're only in here for one night (I said a week though)
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron
One shot of Goose, one shot of 'tron

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Round of applause, baby make that ass clap
You know your man he a fraud, I gotta have that
She want a bodyguard, I'll be her New Edition
She pray for Louboutins, must be her True Religion
Now I'm lookin' for Taraji and somebody with a body like China
China? The one from King of Diamonds who designed her
I call her Barbie, pink Ferraris on her birthday
And I'm a make sure every day is like the first day
She want another round, fuck her to another round
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground
Every day another girl and another town
I don't just beat the pussy, I runs it to the ground

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Chris]
Sunday night, Grey Stone, neck full of gray stones
Staring at the crowd, trying to see who I'm a take home
Game said "straight 'tron, " I be on that champagne
Bitches all around us, trying to watch us do the damn thang
Shouts out to Joey Crack, chicks like, "oh he back"
Welcome to my house party, OG, roll it back
Blow it if he showin' that, keep a few loaded gats
Bitch niggas showin' out, real niggas notice that
California lifestyle, fuckin' with my nigga Chuck
[?], Young Chris, nigga what, all we know is get to it
Stack high live it up, fuckin' with that Grey Stone
Everybody get 'em up, yeah

[Hook]


That Marry Jane
That OG Kush, that sour diesel drive them girls insane
I roll it up, she disappear like David Blane
And she ain't try to book a flight on that paper plane
She don't wanna hit the J
She don't wanna hit the J
She don't wanna hit the J
She don't wanna hit the J

Don't want an undefeated title, don't want my chain
Don't want that new kid red, bitch, is money gain
See that red Maserati, niggas know it's game
Drive that bitch down road screens and blow the brains
Got that Rolly on my wrist, man that hoe insane
Remind me of my chick Regatta, she always pay.
Got a squad full chicks, they ain't dropping names
They all call like the get up play for Notre Dame
What's the next? Gotta dig ins, yea, that's right, that's right
You know I'll be digging, I'll be eating on the kitten, I'll be picking out
Never take her out to crustaceans and the in and out
Just like that Charlie Shay, nigga goin' in 'er mouth
She do everything 'xcept smoke that mean let a nigga poke
That mean she be off the coke like players centerfolds
Swear to God she a potent man
But she like Lindsay Lohan, except she be running from that dope man

That Harry Potter, that Marry Jane
That OG Kush, that sour diesel drive them girls insane
I roll it up, she disappear like David Blane
And she ain't try to book a flight on that paper plane
Cause she don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit the J)
She don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit the J)
She don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit it)
Now she don't wanna hit the J (woh oh woh oh)

Hit these bitches in my face, I'm blowing up
And when I'm stepping in the place, we'll be calling up
Fourteen bottles of Ace, models showing up
I tell 'er, homie break that down, and we gon roll it up
It's Friday and she ain't got shit to do
And we ain't got shit to do
So umm, what's good with you?
Smoke a little, talk a little, roll that up
Girl twist that J, remind me of my nigga Rondo
I know she ain't trying to hit that J
Different chains, different lokes
Different days, different strokes.
I smoke that shit that made Arnold and Willis broke
You know my lifestyle, squeeshes in them life styles
Bitches in the white house, red Camarro piped out.
I'll be iced out, my blunts be packed in
I'll smoke them till it's no more, I'm like the pack ten
I'm 'bout to pack ten bitches with them accents
Man we 'bout to pack twelve swishers in that black hen

That Harry Potter, that Marry Jane
That OG Kush, that sour diesel drive them girls insane
I roll it up, she disappear like David Blane
And she ain't try to book a flight on that paper plane
Cause she don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit the J)
She don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit the J)
She don't wanna hit the J (she don't wanna hit it)
Now she don't wanna hit the J (woh oh woh oh)


[Intro]
DJ Ski! The Game
California Republic mixtape
Long await, droppin Thursday, bitch!
{DJ Ski...}

[Chorus: Pharrell]
It must be tough
Seein yo' boy doin the same shit
Ridin around in things you can't get
With the window down, puffin like it ain't shit...
It must be tough; it must be tough...
Seein the glare from my chain and wrist
Me and 20 goons lookin dangerous
E'rybody paid, all doin the same shit...
Countin money nigga
Tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds [3X]
Thousands, thousands (it must be tough)

[The Game]
It must be tough watchin a nigga ball like Carmelo
My cars is all yellow, my broads is all yellow
What's wrong with y'all fellas? You fuckin up my energy
Used to be my ace, now you wastin my Hennessy
The remedy for haters is crap tables in Vegas
That crack ain't gettin it lately, I'm stackin that paper, baby
Maybe I should get a maybe, or maybe I should call (Baby)
My (Cash Money) is crazy, I crashed up my Mercedes
and bought me a Ferrari, the license plates say SORRY
The insides safari, the paint job Amari
And when the sun hit that bitch, man
Bounce off them 24's and land on my wristband
You better keep your arm on yo' bitch, man
Or you gon be Jamal Crawford - sixth man comin off that bench man
And it's a shame man, yo' bitch gon make it rain a bender
(Ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I brush them haters off, like fuck outta here!
Open up my garage, pull that Porsche truck outta there
Like fuck outta here, I'm up outta here
I jump on my hog, throw on that Rough Ryder gear
I'm a rider yeah, I'm a roller bitch
I might be through with Benzes like here, hold this 6
I get money with the players they duckin and dodgin Feds
For my bread, bring the lead, cause I'm sittin on the edge
Actin like I don't get it, actin like I don't hustle
Actin like I don't Diddy, actin like I don't Russell
Then you wonder why I be, actin like I don't trust you
If you ain't with me then fuck you, next time I see you I cut you
How mad was you? Cause last time I hugged you
I felt the negative energy nigga I could have snuffed you
Bye hater, cause I'm feelin like (Jada) nigga "We Gon' Make It"

[repeat 2X]
Tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds [3X]
Thousands, thousands (it must be tough)

[Interlude]
How many cars we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
How many cribs we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
How many hoes we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
How many times we told y'all? (Thousands, thousands)
How many goons we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
How many guns we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
How many haters we got nigga? (Thousands, thousands)
Damn... it must be tough

[Chorus]


Walk up in the club with the million dollar is on
Swing her side to side, like my head long
Feeling like Tucci in this small fucker
Eyes Japanese, blowing sushi in this motherfucker
No true religions, just levi, come on down to the ski hive
Your bitch love to play soft ball, I let her ballin' knee high
She ride the dick like yee-haw
She don't fuck with no cowboys
I beat it up like I'm he-man
She love fuckin' them key men
And after I score I do the saucer and then
Victor crew is in that Phantom
Drop the antenna
I think I see some haters in here
I think I see some haters in here
Caught the ratch (dawg)

(Dawg) Cause them niggas still mean muggin'
Nigga what you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
What you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Bitch, whatcha lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Man, that shit don't even mean nothin'

Yea, they mean muggin', the 3D version
Ball in your face like Pee Wee Herman
Jack of all trades, no ace of spades
But I got a ace in my twenty ounces Gatorade
Shake that, shake that, shake it then pull it
I have me a threesome, round four something
Asta la vista, grid storm freezer
Automatic weapon, chopper had a seizure
Fire. Snap back through your snap back
Ran out of room and my trunks all need a hash back
How you niggas leaking?
Hope you niggas listenin'
Big money talk. Why you niggas whisperin'?

Cause them niggas still mean muggin'
(Dawg) Nigga what you lookin' at?
You nigga still mean muggin'
(Dawg) What you lookin' at?
You nigga still mean muggin'
(Dawg) Bitch, whatcha lookin' at?
You nigga still mean muggin'
(Dawg) Man, that shit don't even mean nothin'

Roll up in the club like a owner's motherfucka'
Old niggas kicking jeans I'm like pawning motherfucka'
Hoes wipe me down, Little Boosty in this motherfucka'
Rolling that Lili, Fuji's in this motherfucka'
I say Lili, Carmelo in this motherfucka'
Shorty wanna puff, J Lo in this motherfucka'
High rollers bank stop, tattoos, tank tops
Bad news, thanks pop, you mean fool lamb chops
You know I run my city, please believe that
Got that work with them canines on rehab
Niggas licking up their face, we go eye in that
Get Rob Cole game, he gon let you buy it back

(Dawg) Cause them niggas still mean muggin'
Nigga what you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
What you lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Bitch, whatcha lookin' at?
(Dawg) You nigga still mean muggin'
Man, that shit don't even mean nothin'


[Intro: Mele]
Now that I'm paid...
Whoooo

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Ridin' in a cab, but I'm dreaming on a slab
15 ounces at a time, pussy nigga, do the math
10 ice chains, prince like James
The day I made a stack in the trap, my life changed
Y'all rides swingers, we ride daytons
It don't matter where you from, haters stay hatin'
Keep the windows tinted, artillery when I'm in it
Whip it in the kitchen before Hillary became a Clinton
Assholes by nature, cash flows is major
In the old school, or M codes for kreggers [?]
Started with a crumb, and turned it to a brick
They were calling me a bum, my turn, I'm the shit
Razor flip things, age of 15 (hello!)
Parked the Chevy in that thing, glaze like Kris Kreme
Rolls on the wrist when the shows ain't exist
Now my money long enough to put my foes on a 6 (Bawse!)

[Hook: Mele]
I pull up front to the club with my doors to the sky
(Now that I'm paid)
I shut down the malls like a boss, 'cause I gotta be fly
(Now that I'm paid)
I've got all the bottles I want, bottles I want to hit
I'm a do it 'cause I've got all this money
Nobody gon' stop it (now that I'm paid)

[Verse 2: Game]
[?] with the Franklins, carpooling with Bawse
Army medal on the burgundy Ghost, fuck what it cost
Umbrellas in the doors, Audemars in the dash
Wale in that Ferrari, but that Phantom on his ass
We gon' spend this money, it's whatever, let them things pop
Kids gon' be alright 'cause Daddy invested in wingstop
Money and residuals comin' like it's a ritual
Drinking this liquid money, them bottles gon' be invisible
Fuck the rest of you petty cash niggas, I'm invincible
Glocks identical, remove niggas from the physical
Smokin' that dual exhaust, flossin', fuckin' them haters
And finger fucking the waitress while sipping this Ace Of Spades
I'm throwin' money for nothin', Hawaiian kush I be puffin'
Sharin' hoes with my crew while these other niggas be cuffin'
Know she love that money game, stay fuckin' with double M
Think a nigga about to put her in that bubble Benz
Don't let the devil in!

[Hook: Mele]

[Bridge x2: Mele]
Fuck these niggas, we got all these hoes
(We got all these hoes)
All this money, let me put you on
(All this money in my hand)

[Hook: Mele]


Look momma, I'm a chiefer, smoking on a reefer
I know you say you can't suck dick but I'm a teach ya
Bad lil bitch, yea I think that I'm a keep 'er
And she can't miss school so I fuck 'er on the bleacher
Got the models on deck, got them hoes in check
All these bitches know my name so my pull gettin' wet
I'll be rollin' rollin' rollin', off that potion we be bongin'
We be smokin', we be joinin' till they keep their party goin'
I'll be high, I'll be low, you try to row a bitch, let's go
If you did not put men on my weed then you can hit my jawn

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)

And all bitched branded
Tatted on the pussy, Jordan's and some spandex
Rolling up the cookie, please understand that she tryna fuck me but I'm a make 'er fuck my man now
Poppin' bottles like new year's eve and we standin' on the couch screamin' pussy money weed
In the club blowin' trees so these bitches wanna leave
And she ain't even trippin', daddy spendin' on her weed
Yea, and all my bitches they exotic
It's a party in her mouth and I'm her nuts so I'm invited
I will suck it, I will bite it, I will fucking start a riot
Got that cush in my pocket and I'm selling like a parent ah
Fuck, it's Miley Cyrus
Who the fuck is Miley Cyrus?
It's a party at the crib and it's private

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)

Ah, that's all I know about in this lifestyle
Put a dollar on a pussy and I wipe it down
Cool motherfuckaz, we don't tolerate clowns
We in this young life, care less, smoke rounds
Below homie Steve I hang 'er with a pou'
The bed call me Game, hold that shit down
I'm 'bout to get this motherfucka game a new song
Fuckin' relief, they don't know I'm with the fam
Ridin' 'round in my city
Smoked out I'm driftin'
Everybody, brother, sister, cousins chases fuckin' bailin'
That bitch fuckin', she guilty
I ride that and get filthy
We hop by so get liftin'
I smoke strong, that shit will be a Simpsons boy
And young boys get offended boy
Me, I'm just handlin' this grown man Dennis boy

(Pussy) Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy, money pussy money weed
Pussy, money, pussy money weed
Pussy money weed
Pussy money weed (pussy)


[Verse 1: Game]
I'm about to tear this fuckin' track out
Pretend it's Keri Hilson and blow a fuckin' back out
22nd mixtape, half of em diss tapes
But fuck who I was dissin' because I never made a mistake
[?] got what he deserved, Jay, I might have been trippin'
I was fallin', I was slippin'
He was Jordan, I thought I was Pippen
He was winnin', I was losin'
He threw a jab, I started bruisin'
So I threw in the towel just to separate all confusion
Ivy Blue is beautiful, me sayin' that's unusual
That's the father in me, don't think I'm tryin' to be cool with you
Thug life, Rihanna knuckles, Gucci shirt, designer buckles
Louis Vuitton billboard, the nigga's boy just tryin' to hustle
Poster boy for them drug dealers
I just want you all to love me
But I ain't handsome, I ain't trying to bug niggas
Y'all the Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
But every now and then, I gotta remind y'all

[Verse 2: Game]
It's that red bottom boss, nigga
Burgundy Bentley truck, fuck what it cost nigga
That V12 start up like Ross nigga
That's why them hoes call me the boss nigga
Catch me in the Maybach, where them seats recline way back
Remember, I had a Rocky for ya, and I ain't talkin' ASAP
You know I got that K strap, chopper with the base hat
If you see Tip trillin', King of Diamonds, tell I got like eight stacks
Ace of Spades by the crates, biatch
Never lose, like Alexander the Great, biatch
I only win like Bay, I run the city like mayors
Don't make me go dig up them old Chuck Taylor's
Back when me and Snoop was the only ones throwin' up gang signs
Ya niggas wasn't bloods until I cosigned y'all
But y'all that Verizon man, I'm just gon' stand behind y'all
And sometimes I gotta remind y'all

[Verse 3: Game]
Taylor Gang nigga, I ain't Wiz doe
I got that yellow brick road inside my ear lobes
Playin' ice hockey, feelin' like Gretzky
Los Angeles King, and I'm who the whole city cheer for
Niggas throwin' subliminals, act like I don't hear those
I could give y'all 100 bars, but you all know y'all fear those
And plus, I'm too attached to my lifestyle
Fuck them Air 1's, I'm too attached to these spikes now
Louis Vuitton's, hard as croutons
They comfortable like futons
They suede, grey poupon
The yellow like Luke on
The Lakers, he was traded
But they should have moved that nigga Marion, Gloria [?]
Damn, was that too strong?
These niggas gettin' pooped on
While I get my Duke on, and crossover like Duhon
Luke warm, I'm too hot, you're too cold
I'm 2Pac, you're too old for hip hop
Stop. Recognize...


Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, I got my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

When I infiltrate Des Moines sometimes I feel like goin' back to sleep
But I gotta keep this product on the street
Tryna take over my turf
Stretch me out in a hurse cause that is what it's worth
Baby momma keeps sweatin' it nigga, cause the rent's due
Twon son's, daughter on the way, I think I'm French too
Get out on the streets stack the money like bill Gates
And do whatever it takes to keep my family straight
Livin' in compent, some say it's suicide
Crossin' the street and catch a bullet from a drive by
My homie Dan's got it sippin' on a sÃ©ance
So many dead homies
When I hear about it I can't cry
I lost my grandmother, that's when I flipped
Only decision to make now, blood or a crip
Drove across the tracks, opened up the door on my Lac
Put the dope in the front, hop in the back
It was like that

Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, I got my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

Throwin' some clothes, grab the 4 and hit the back door
Pop the back gate and meet the fiends by the liquor store
Cops drop by, lookin' at us like we stole somethin'
They hit the brakes, that's when everybody starts runnin'
8 ball in my sock, spring down the block
Cut through the projects and that's when I threw Glock
God damn it felt good to be a home free
The city don't sleep, right next to Long Beach
Art of survivin', this motherfuckin' jungle
Runnin' with the wrong niggas, that will take you under
That's what happened to my nigga Big Wheel
Trusted the wrong bitch, that's what got his ass killed
A blunt and some Hennessey, a lot of good memories
How do you survive when everybody's your enemy?
Before you brush your teeth grab your strap
Cause niggas will pull the jack and bitches will peel you kak
Believe that

Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, I got my funk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

Ain't nothin' better than a down ass bitch
When you're locked up in the pen and she sellin' you neck and flicks
On the tear, reminiscin' like a mother
Two strikes on the case file, locked up state
Now tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to be a father to my kids?
Son gang bangin' cause his daddy doin' nine years
And that happens in every hood in America
Shoot your own brother up and wonder why they scared of ya
And your momma at home without a back bone
Your girl gettin' tired of waitin' so she get her back blown
By your homie, that used to be your man
And you can't do shit cause you're sittin' in the can
And when you get out, you'll probly go and kill this nig
On the third strike, man the jury 'bout to kill this nigga
That's why I don't trust a nigga or a bitch
Cause either way a nigga always ends up caught up in some shit

Nigga I tell the bitch quit
Sit down, shut up and floss my shit
My music gone, all that talkin' ain't it
So sit down, shut up and roll my shit
Now smoke with me, I got my folk with me
Now take this money and hold this up for me
Now let it soak for me
Now bitch is you ready?
I gots to get it, I got, gots to get it

Yea
Game recognize game, nephew
See, when a bitch with me she know if to talk
She gon sit down, shut the fuck up and roll motherfuckin' weed
Talkin' is not an issue, you understand me?
Bitch, you do as I say
When I tell you to talk, you talk and I ain't told you to talk so shut the fuck up
You hear me?
Real pimp shit nigga
West Coast

Hey, that's your own problem man
Bitches takin' your all equip, runnin' you niggas crazy
Got niggas wanna kill like yourself
Man, fuck a bitch man

How many bitches in the club just to try to fuck a platinum rapper
Poking microscopic holes into the Magnum rappers
Hopping on the dick but I ain't throwing carrots at ya
You ain't gon' Worldstar me, I ain't your average rapper
You drinking all the Goose then bitch I ain't finna pay
You don't look like your Twitter avatar anyway
Bitch you look like an Avatar anyway
And that's the same bitch that was stalking Fab' ain't it Trey? (Yup)
And this is how I know you're giving free head
If you was getting paid, the bottom of your shoe would be red
But it ain't, she claiming she a saint
But as soon she see Dwight she go hard in the paint
But her girlfriend the type you wanna take home
Throw a little Drake on it really shouldn't take long
Then she told me that she wanna meet Trey Songz
I told that bitch strip and start singing all Trey song's

She wanna have my baby so my baby's in her mouth

Yea, I'm so hoesome
Everywhere I go a nigga axe me to hold some
They wanna be like me when they grow up
And I ain't grew up yet
Shit, I ain't blew up yet
Millions in the bank and I ain't made me a buck yet
So I guess y'all upset
Welcome to the club like you in the fuckin' ass
She says she wanna have my child
I say gimme a black, I'm out

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Where the Almighty know, well alrighty then
I'm all mighty ho call me mighty Joe Quinn
With Josephine Baker in the Benz
On them shiny toes, glass slipper niggas with your Cinderalla shins
I'm a shark in the water, you see my flippers and my fins
The pool is my palace go and send them niggas in
Rockstar, let's take the Bentley for a swim
I run the world take your hood to the gym
Stretch it all out, get it all thin
Back on my fat shit get it all again
Rap on my back bitch, hip hop on my brim
You think you're high now
Well thy style's no higher than my eyebrows, this should be a sin
Cleanse, flow clear kinda like how air look
Or like a Cinderella pair look
Or like Cinderella barefoot
No matter how many ankles of crews
The moral of the story: you can't fill my shoes
Lu!

[Verse 2: Game]
(Mass murderer!)
And in the last verse from Lupe, touche
Ferrari drop top, but it came with a toupee
Niggas say they got cars like us, but do they?
Rap Phantoms, pack tannoms and strippers from
Atlanta, mÃ©nage Ã  trois let em fuck, I watch, stay on
My j-o, only when I'm punchin' the clock, up
On the block, everything mine, I stay on my grind
Chasin' dollar signs, bumpin' Nas, it's halftime
And I'm the G-A, money signs it's easy nigga, don't
Want shit for free but weezy nigga, load the Glock up
Cops pop up, you can go to Iraq, take all the straps
Come back and couldn't stop us, Aston with the
Top jush, paint job, rock dust, hand with what I got
In the trunk will get us all locked up, so fuck niggas
And I'm talkin' from behind the trigga, now come
Get a nigga, cus I'm of niggas

[Hook:]
Hatin' on me, you wastin' your time
Nigga wanna kill me? Then go and stand in that line
Kill that shit, I ain't tryna hear that shit
[Gun cocking] I know you hear that shit
So nigga
Skate on, skate on (Whatchu gon do?)
Skate on, skate on (Lupe tell em nigga)
S-S-Skate on, skate on
Me and my niggas tryna stay on, skate on

[Verse 3: Game]
Usually wake up early like them Philly niggas
In the weed spot rolling kush A-R go get Philly nigga
First smoke a not, we swimming it hard rock
We push it out all spots 'till they get us up off blocks
Straight for the bout [?] pots, then bag it in in Banglocks
Watch for the top cops cus we nourish our own crops
Smoke it like blood clops, inside of the drug spot
Will take em to Van Gundy, big man on the block
Don't worry bout my residentials or my credentials
My flow will cocktail, through a Def Jam window
That's for Shekyan, I'm the rapper niggas fear
No need for Craig Mack to kick the flava in ya ear
Keep the Lambo in fifth gear, catch me on a sunny
Day, paint drippin' like Lil Weezy in Baby tears
King of LA I think I made it clear, ain't nobody outselling 5
It's a Eminem or Dre n shit

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Game]
Now I've been rappin' for 9 years, 4 months
45, 46, 47 seconds, I was Doctor Dre's weapon
Had the option to stay and kept swerving
Make some rookie mistakes but so did Kyrie Irving
If Fifty was Lebron on a bad night, or Floyd Mayweather
When many packi out did his jab right, I fucked a
Bad bitch but that was last night, and I ain't gon' say
No names but she was singing and her ass tight
This year I'm gettin' my cash right, 30 years old
Let Drake or Soulja Boy live fast life, who ever said
The Game wack, change that, (be) fore the thing claps
Niggas fucked up rap, I bought the flame back
Couple albums later, still the same cat, and my P-O
Only motherfucker thinkin' that I ain't strapped
Next time you doubt me, I'm a have my accountin' down
Southny, we can do this rap shit without me
I'm out G, and if 2011 Audi, twenty two parral leaf
Oils up like the Saudi's, bout to pick new broad from the hotel
Yo Pharrell, let em know


Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs
Those have forsake it cause you're smart and you're beautiful
Success, good friends
The best revenge
All my park has got bigger and I've never been hearin'
Let 'em say whatever they want, they just want slower digits
Success (success), good friends (good friends)
The best (the best) revenge (revenge)

She bent over in that closet lookin' for them red bottoms
She know I like the pair with them spikes on
I mean that's all she rocket
She got that Louis rolled on, that thing satin
And you know that ass fat if I'm gon take the loss in this matin yea
Don't stop, let me hit it from the front
Don't stop, let me hit it from the back
Hit it till you cum, hit it till you run
Use my tongue and fuck up your act
Now she ain't goin' nowhere for a while
IPhone ringin'? That's ol' girl
Beat the pussy up, that's the hook right there
Bang on track no. 3 on that cold world
Never give a nigga problems
Got a nigga back like Sean Diddy Combs got Harlem
And she better than my niggas
It's like holdin' a nigga down
What's that? You call it

Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs
Those have forsake it cause you're smart and you're beautiful
Success, good friends
The best revenge
All my park has got bigger and I've never been hearin'
Let 'em say whatever they want, they just want slower digits
Success (success), good friends (good friends)
The best (the best) revenge (revenge)

Look at all them girls hatin'
Look at all them girls hatin'
Look at all them girls hatin' outside that club, in that line waitin'
Cause she can't be you, she can't be Nicki, she can't be Kim
And we over here sippin' that Ace while you over there man cause you sippin' that gin
How many shots do I take to get to your center?
Take 'er to the bathroom then I go in 'er
In 'er in 'er in 'er so far
I could see everything that she ate fo' dinner
Pop my car, hell yea, fuckin' righteous
Smart girl, she can give me brains all night
I'm a beat it up like a USC fight
Most time that I ever spent in 'er I liked
And a girl french, just al'ight
Keep fuck with them cause they ain't my type
Get them bags packed and meet me at the port
Grab the passport, I ain't tryna miss my flight

Baby it's mind over matter, don't fall for the low key dogs
Those have forsake it cause you're smart and you're beautiful
Success, good friends
The best revenge
All my park has got bigger and I've never been hearin'
Let 'em say whatever they want, they just want slower digits
Success (success), good friends (good friends)
The best (the best) revenge (revenge)


[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Damn, thank God momma son made it at twenty three
Still remembering a struggle hidden deep in me
Momma gone, ain't no single daddy memory
I became my own man the age of seventeen
Trying make this money flip like it's a trampoline
I was hard headed, grandfather diabetic
I was trying do it big, like I was Faith Evans
Praying to the heavens, I can see my daughter smile
Know she watching as her daddy rip this record down
Know I love you baby, tell my God I said whatup'
And know I seen em' just meeting ends, so my family up
I should pray harder, instead I tote a pistol
Speed dial em, killers running if I ever whistle
Real nigga, that's just my genetics
Hustle hard got my money doing calisthenics
I stretch paper, every dollar bill

[Hook: x2]
Niggas cry tears, when I see my first mil (First Mil)
Bad bitch with' me bet she know the drill
Bad bitch with' me bet she know the drill
Bad bad bitch with' me bet she know the drill

[Verse 2: The Game]
I gotta' bad bitch with' me, and she know the drill
And she know my ex, X pill
She only listen to me, Ace, and Meek Mill
I told her tat my name on it, so I know it's real
She know the value of a dollar bill
She know how real or fake them counterfeit hunded's feel
She know the difference between Derrick Rose and D-Wade
She know the difference between being broke and stayin', paid
She know the difference between vuve and spades
She know the difference between warrants and raids
Never confuse when talkin' Glocks and dem' K's
Show her the shoe, she put a number on dem' J's
Like, it dem' is cool grays
I'm like, dem' is cool shades
I'm like, dem' is Spike Lee's
She like, yeah schooldays
And she bang the documentary still
Said that motherfucka' cold, yeah, Buffalo Bill

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I ain't never ran from nobody, and I never will
Lunch time on these niggas, cause' I'm on my second mil
I just dropped a mixtape, lookin' like my second deal
Club live thirty bottles, and I'm on my second bill
And I be gettin' high as my electric bill
Ask bout' me in the hood, they say I'm extra real
Cause' ain't nobody never rob me, I ain't never squeal
And ain't nobody never try, my niggas love to kill
Ridin' round with' chuck, but it ain't a game though
My black wall niggas, told me you a lame though
The Glock got a beam on it, like Kano
Banana clips and lemon squeezers, just to split your mango
My down bitch, never count the counterfeit
Cause' she know the real from fake, I had her around some shit
Before I ever thought of rap, I had a pound to get
And a piece of steel, I never thought I'd see a mil

[Hook]


Tell them hoes I go by Mr. Spades now
Lifestyle, Mele, MWSMG yea

I'm in this bitch gettin' money like vodo
Cincinnati snap back, new era logo
I'm the new era's logo, I'm the boss, I'm the shit
New Bentley truck, never south as a bitch
Getting' lost in the wind, Chevy traffic on the rims
Got my bitch in that Benz, doin' 90 on the 10
I got 99 problems, not a motherfuckin' friend
See my niggas beat my niggas, we gon ride it to the end
In the club, blowin' them racks cause that space never cheap
We got three bottles a piece and we all got pizzas
When it come to all this money we divide it like pizza
When it comes to fuckin' hoes we gon slide 'em like Visas
Bitch I'm 'bout my paper check and heat blows in Geneva
Puerto Rican in Geneva and she got Ferrari features
Shittin' on you peones, then dine by those neon
Use to run the rock and bass like Dian

I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo

Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up

I'll sleep outside for the rest of my life if the rap shit don't work out al'ight?
No ice on the nigga
Your wife on a nigga
You don't like no nigga?
Let me put the red light on a nigga
Bad bitch from France, she gon put them spikes on a nigga
Then we in New York sittin' next to spike on the niggas
But I'm rootin' for the Clippers
Getting' sued tryna move for them strippers
Keep the tool and nigga ain't gon slip up
Jack the Ripper, nigga ain't gonna slip up
Slow down, takin' your hoes down
Nigga we in your town, spillin' in some more now
Money Gang got tracks and spas
Guess you could say we the new Mo Towns

I'm lookin' for a bad bitch and she know what I want
Red vone and you better bring a friend
Why fight it in the front and you know I gotta stunt
Fuck the line, girl you know we gettin' in

I shut it down in my side of town
Fuck your girl when you're not around
She in love with my bank roll
She like the way I make her go (uuu)
Move around the city with a chick like J Lo
Fuckin' with a boss, baby everything paid fo'

Money Gang, MG be the logo
It's Atlas, B dub S if you don't know, dog
You only live once, yo lo
So I'm at the bar, takin' shots to the head, Miguel Cotto
Wrist froze like a person's pose for a photo
Big dog yard, you ain't allowed in here, Toto
We don't lose, only move for that money
If it ain't about that money I don't move rocks
Phantom on cruise, engine on the hood
Heavenly white paint job
Hater face look like he smelled a stink bomb
(Look at it) Got me feelin' like a ball playa
I don't play ball but I ball like a star playa
I'm a star hater, you know how I do
Swag super stupid, got a low IQ
Bottles in the air like we don't got a care
If you do it like we do it, baby hawl it if you hear

I'm in the Cincinnati gettin' money like vodo
Across the world, gettin' all this money
I can't get enough (Money Gang be the logo)
Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up

Ladies see it when that Phantom pullin' up


Far as dough, I'm stuffed with cash, popping like fuckle tags
Rappin' in Belize, Louis Vuitton duffle bags
Guess who home, my nigga Shyne
Straight out the brick house to a brick house
Money flowin' like it's Chris Dale
Shine on it swiss styles, I'm hood as Kid Styles
My Clair Bomber jacket perfect for the pit stop, it is now
You boys don't want none, release on the blood Glock
They here by, they go numb
Goin' plan no. 1 with the gang no. 2
Start track no. 3 back to ypee MV
(Gots the chill) While I stack a mill to the ceiling
Ten gangstas outside, meeting gangstas in the building
One nigga can't stop this motherfuckin' killin'
Hell on earth of repercussion, the blood is spelt on my children
Cowboys and Indians, motherfuck the pilgrims
Infiltrate my squad near every cat buildin'

(They don't want none)
Don't make a nigga pull Glocks in the shots
Spin that black ghost around the block
(They don't need none)
We got pills for days
Give a bitch chills and thrills for days
Know I mean?
(Let 'em have some)
Ace of Spades by the fountains
Cush by the ounces, mill on the mountains
(In a week I'm)
We bringin' the fuck
Yo B, let 'em know
Money Gang uh

Fish out the cooker, bein' busy for the pussy
In the kitchen with the cook of blood yea, then you rough us
You fuckin' hookers, y'all a bunch of Ashton Kutcher's
With the finger tag backs, you ain't jackin' that
Yo Game, I'm laughin' at these cop who turned shote us
Imagine that, you're mad a fuckin' life happen at
You's the only one there, I swear
Stuck the blood clut cryin'
I'm in Belize with Game when these shots fired in this silence
Y'all motherfuckaz singin'

Check it, what the blood clot?
Nigga blood got Ferrari's and Lambo's parked outside the drug spot
Survived five shots, you know that
When bitch niggas died, they cried
Cause they had to pay for that
Payers took it, where the blow at?
I just won a hundred racks on blackjack and you know I'm 'bout to blow that
They don't make real niggas where you from
Sick 45, I'm 'bout to finger fuck the trigga till them hollows come
Talk shit? Swallow one
You fuckin' move me
I disrespect niggas like in old Italian movies
I'm sayin', I live, you ready
I come in the restaurant with my shirt off and spit in your fuckin' spaghetti sauce
Boss, my pocket's fatter than my nigga Ross
Wipe this milkatrone off my mouth with my Louis glove
Understand?
I'm a California felon
Bust your cerebellum, skateboard go and tell 'em

Don't make a nigga pull Glocks in the shots
Spin that black ghost around the block

[Intro: Pharrell]
Ain't no other nigga here real as my dude
And used to throw money like this - WHOOOO!
Honey what you lookin at? Ain't no need to guessin
Starin over here you about to be a legend

[Chorus: Pharrell]
And when my nigga come home
We gon' party 'til 6 in the morn
I tell you when my nigga come home
We gon' pop champagne 'til it's gone
I tell you when my nigga come home, we gon' celebrate
Have lobster (and) shrimp (and) pasta, steak
When my nigga come home
He can have any damn thing that he want

[The Game]
I got a nigga locked up, for about another month
He did nine years, he'll be home before I finish this blunt
(What else?) I just bought an ounce of skunk
Me and my nigga 'bout to go hard like when LeBron dunk
(Yeah) We (Ridin' High) like Southern niggaz in the dump
And e'rybody and they momma know U.G.K. in the trunk
(What's in the backseat?) North Cakalak' freaks
And the shit that we smokin can melt the Mac on they cheeks
Well we headed to that Magic City, he ain't see no ass and titties
in about a decade, these hoes 'bout to get paid
They took him to the back, I ain't seen his ass in two hours
Two-time felon takin a shower in the motherfuckin strip club

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
Inhale, inhale
and blow it out, blow it out

[The Game]
When my nigga come home, that's on E'RYTHANG, I got him!!
Know why? Cause we was like that, and we came from the bottom
Know how many pictures I was mad that I took
cause I couldn't throw up the hood, the police had my shook
And all you wanted was Superhead's book
So I sent because I meant it now the clothes is the crooks
And your girl, she fine as a motherfucker
Told you she cheated on you, she was lyin like a motherfucker
When you went in, we was dreamin 'bout that trey
Now it's a four door flyin spur with "Killafornia" plates
'Member when we was in the spot, writin to them Dre beats
Now I'm fuckin with some N*E*R*Ds; Chad and Skateboard P
But remember when we was hard?
Sayin to each other nothin rippin us apart
Now a nigga ballin and you sittin on the yard
But you comin home to that Ferrari in the car
Max that motherfucker!

[Chorus + Interlude]

[Snoop Dogg]
One thing you can count on when you touch down
You gon' have it all, laid out, everything is paid out
Comin home eventually, you in the penitentiary
The homies like to mention me cause I looks out, essentially
Big BC cuz, J-Dawg and Tray Deee
Young Joda, Scotty Boi and Y.C.
Fame gave me cavi, and cavi became chips
Blue put me on the set; nigga, it's 20 Crip
My cousin Flip been locked up for 25
And Dre-Lo, he's a real 20 Crip for life
Now if I mention yo' name, you know the business cuz
When you get it - you know we livin it up!

[Chorus + Interlude]


I'm a motherfucking father of faggots
Plus I'm a motherfucking bag it father
Plus I'm a fucking faggot that fucks your maths off till I'm fucking your asthma proper
And that's a drastic motherfucker karma so pop an acid tap
Cause that's exactly let's hope that you fucking faggot, you punk
To the fucking state on this cover by these fucking magazines
All perked in our basements, the conscious thing that nothing matters
And you're wasted and smack the fuck out Rihanna
Guess that's what you get for your slap persona
That's what the world wants, a girl cut the talks about how much she wants to [moans]

I'm about to blow my motherfucking brains out
Because it's cool, cause it's true, plus I want someone to fucking listen
And this is pretty much the only way you'll pay attention
Which is retarded if you think about it. But why think about it?
Why just knock it off your rock and fuckin' drink and shout out
What's wrong with the world so you can learn some shit you think is outlet
Slit your wrist to it, listen to Chris' music
Keep pumpin' your fuckin' fist to this bullshit
Piss on the flag that has nurtured you
Offend your rights, persecute, do some dumb shit
Loose on the run from the fuckin' law that shoot your guns at
Cause you're the fuckin' gangster you planned to be aren't you?
It's fuckin' dangerous and harmful for just one statement of lawsuite
This money in Bakers paint at a cross sheet
But that's not gonna make us remorse


[JT]
Another G-Man Stan production
The originator of this 808 shit in the Bay area
You got your boy JT the Bigga Figga
thuggin it out with my young nigga the Game, and my homey Bluechip
Blacksox, oh boy!  Hooked up with Get Low Records
Puttin this shit together, my nigga

It ain't a nigga in the game that could hold me down
I've been independent forever so they know me now
And I'm the cat they gotta find when they wanna get signed
You wanna get your paper right you gotta study my grind
I'm like Rush in "Krush Groove," a nigga that bust moves
right out, and tuck tools, bullets that bust dudes
Ain't no beef in the briefcase, just beef for Pete's sake
We round up cats, to beat 'em in a street race
We count paper up, to make a nigga change his plans
They under weight so they ain't gettin off they gram
You mad at my boys, cause we choppin 'em in
They make twenty then the Fig want 10
That's the rules that the Get Low, play by
The block boys stay high, California stock with K-5
It's the rules that the Get Low play by
Them block boys stay high, the California K-5

[Chorus: The Game]
Huh, it's the Blacksox doin a joint together
The whole world stoppin to listen, ol' breakers poplockin to this
And white boys headboppin in 6's, niggaz boxin in prison
Shit bang hard like a conjugal visit
And the game ain't big enough for niggaz so move over
Matter fact, move out, we takin over
Them boys is comin, and they aimin straight for the neck
The B-L-A, C-K, S-O-X

[Bluechip]
Yo, yo, well it's the B dot L dot, you know the rest
Wanted by the feds, hated by the ATF
You can catch me at the DuPont Inn, two dykes swallowin gin
Shorty sucked me out of my Timbs
My bad, that's your wife? Fuck your life
Anyway I heard you workin for vice
You ain't real man you hide behind ice
Youse a impostor, snatch him off the roster
Always live by the rule, get dough, or die tryin
Hardcoded into shinin
Pass the bucket now I'm back on bet it
If, beef was erased man my tool gon' finish
Never been the loudmouth type
Sugar Shane of this rap shit, southpaw when the mac spit
Listen rookie, don't make me mad boy
Or you gon' be like Big, a dead (Bad Boy)

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin goin, back back
to the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell

[Chorus]


I'm tucked on the border line
Where I'm picturing stones
I hit the switch, and watch them bitches be gone
Get it right figga, I'm in my rear view
Cause the streets can hear you
Bright moon to steer you, it's gotta be wild
Get in position cause the streets you'll find 
Matter of fact I'm on a detail grind
Without no female lies, me and my team move
Ice like snow storms, the price gets
Tighter than vise grips, cause game is priceless
Jammed up with ice picks no way you can write this
Seven on the dices, the way that I like shit
Catch me in the background holding the mac now
You never back down bitch you better back down

Look in my eyes nigga tell me what you see
This right here, it's for the books like Frasier and Ali
Strap in ya belt cause we takin' the ride
Through this concrete jungle, where you scratch to survive
Ya gotta, play by the rules cause the wolves is lurkin'
Night time the streets is quiet, but them wolves is workin'
You can slip if you want, that's when ya know it's real
Back against the wall, that's when ya blow the steel

Hey yo I spit that crack, hit you with a freebie
After that, bet you keep coming back to see me 
See me, now picture that
When I'm better than any other chick that rap
Ya'll acting like I ain't never picked up the bat
Or picked up a mac, and make a bitch shit in her slacks
So try chill and relax, till I little spaz
I done filpped chicks for just trying to give me a dap
But since boy I take ya jewels, I ain't givin 'em back
And they can investigate me I ain't givin 'em jack
It's neither big I bang [?] for the streets strictly
That's why everywhere I go I got beef in the east with me 
Give me ya leaf and the piece is sticky, don't try nothing tricky
I punch you in ya neck go tell ya moms to hit me
Custom made khaki's, no I'm not sticky
Who told ya'll chicks you was fucking with me

Look in my eyes nigga tell me what you see
This right here, it's for the books like Frasier and Ali
Strap in ya belt cause we takin' the ride
Through this concrete jungle, where you scratch to survive
Ya gotta, play by the rules cause the wolves is lurkin'
Night time the streets is quiet, but them wolves is workin'
You can slip if you want, that's when ya know it's real
Back against the wall, that's when ya blow the steel

Too many hutlers, and not enough customers
Shit on the hood, nobody gonna have no love for ya
Losing ya street cred on the real you can eat lead
And you don't want no problems, praying that the beef dead
Yo they brought me back to strangle the mood 
The little and Slick Rick neck dangling gold
I ain't home but few times a day I be changing my clothes
I want this next generation to know
When rap suck, you brought it back to the essence
So sit back and really think before you ask any questions
Got this game in the cobra clutch cowards ya'll know what's up 
And ya shook what's on this earth I seen so much stuff
I used to roll with Russ, the doors opened up
Doing big big things like making clothes and stuff
Street master mind, ya'll talking asinine
And I ain't have no choice my nigga I had to grind
I'm known for making moves, labels be baking fools
Everything is fixed, it's like people get paid to lose
A few occasions my neighbourhood do it major news
Ya boy got more flavor than Jamican food

Look in my eyes nigga tell me what you see
This right here, it's for the books like Frasier and Ali
Strap in ya belt cause we takin' the ride
Through this concrete jungle, where you scratch to survive
Ya gotta, play by the rules cause the wolves is lurkin'
Night time the streets is quiet, but them wolves is workin'
You can slip if you want, that's when ya know it's real
Back against the wall, that's when ya blow the steel

Let's slow the process elimination
My niggas out for that mighty Dollar, What you chasing?
I done been where you trying to go and back again
I done seen niggas bang they own niggas
And believe me not an accident, so you think I give a fuck
What you say, how you feel
My niggas never tell shit, but a coward will
I used to yap about the Maybach
A real nigga in this industry is like a needle in the hay stack
Fresh deodors, what we got before us
Suckers think they flow sick mind is rigor mortis
I don't know who the fuck ya playing with
Price on ya head could be that bitch ya laying with
That'll take you to ya maker, while I'm in Jamica
Twistin up that Celtic green niggas post like Vin Baker


(We gangsta daddy!)

[Sean T]
Yuh!
I'm sippin on that 'notiq the color of Hulk man
And the blueberry smoke got a nigga twerkin
You niggaz is perkin - so you doin it big?
You roll deep but when I see you it's just you and your kids
I roll sick, my rims feel like helicopter propellers
And my pockets run deep like a Mercer teller
Haters trip when they see the whip dippin by
The paint on it change like the I-95
I'm just Clyde, without the Bonnie, I got the hollowpoint
heat for you niggaz and the po' for the mamis
Sean Gotti, I'm puttin an end to camraderie
I'm lettin off heat, 'til them eyes get watery
Some gon' ricochet, some gon' hit, y'all gon' get 'em
Fluids gon' disperse out like refreshin club serum
I'm deadly as bite venom but I'm far from a snake
I'll hit you up on your birthday while you cuttin your cake

[Chorus: The Game]
We gangsters nigga; you see the cars, the whips
The chains, the fuckin broads we with
We gangsters nigga; we'll come through your hood
a hundred deep and empty the whole clip
We gangsters nigga; we got guns for the beef
And my niggaz'll put you under the street
We gangsters nigga; so you better watch what you say
'Fore I empty the whole glock in your face

[Sean T]
Streets is tough, but ain't no hopscotch lines on the ground
Just burner shells, and police siren sounds
Niggaz know who I am in the town; it ain't a circus
But it might as well be, cause you know I'ma clown
I'm a terrain boss, I know most niggaz envious dawg
And if a nigga owe me change you better give me it dawg
If you feelin like you wanna leap, make like a frog
You niggaz lame, transparent like Wonder Woman's plane
I'm a stunna in this game, a federal figure
Blowin doj' in the hummer, 50 K on my fingers
I'm like a NASCAR winner poppin Mo' and Bill{?}
D-Squad don't give a fuck about nobody else
I pull a {?} to contain your whole, clique for hours
The end result will probably be, pinewood and flowers
So I'll advise you deduct your QP's and powder
We gangsters and we jackin cowards (yup!)

[Chorus]

[Sean T]
S.T. nigga D-Squad, G.G.D
Don't get it twisted motherfucker yeah we do creep
We ride out thug, shit we don't die
We lay low like mechanics tryin to fix up rides
A lot of cats say I'm sick in the head, when I anger it's on
Poodles gon' be up missin or dead
I chop haters up, like an old-ass sample
Or creep through your village, like Stallone in "Rambo"
I'm like piranhas on red meat, I'm on you niggaz
You afros?  Then I guess I got to comb you niggaz
So break bread, when you see me dawg hit the flo'
I'm like a nigga off the X, unpredicta-ble
Imitators always hollerin how gangsta they is
But got about as much courage as the Lion in "The Wiz"
Shit I'm into pullin shanks on you fake Jake cats
Me and my burner hold it down man we go way back

[Chorus]


[JT]
We on our third song, we on our third song, heyyeyy

You understand it, I'm official with mine; I'm double-clutchin
on the fo'-wheel, pushin quarters like niggaz doin dope deals
Fo' cut 50 like a verse and a half
I cut the brick and now we countin the math, we 'bout that birdplay
My crew's committed, you dudes gon' get it
Have a seat you through when I'm finished, my troopers is fitted
Got 'em posted out in Brooklyn, Hollis Queens to the Bridge
We in the studio the Figgaro done did it again
We got factors out in the ditch where they smackin a bitch
I got homies out in the Bronx where they bustin at cops
It ain't no game with the underground, came from the underground
Pushin a hundred thousand, we out the trunk, never browsin
JT, another boss from the Bay
And rest in peace to my boy Mac Dre, what'chu say nigga?
JT, another boss from the Bay
And rest in peace to my boy Mac Dre, motherfucker

[Nina B]
Hey yo it seem to me like e'rybody got they own truth
Believe me I'm in them sheets like phonebooths
I play the game I was born to score
But I'm a lil' too cute for them corner stores
A little too, known, to stand on the block
And a lil' too eager to sit in the spot
Mami, I'm from the Eastside, yup yes that side
Heads fly if I open ya chest that wide
Gimme a bad vibe end up on ya backside
Or you can get your back and side splatted in back of ya ride
And I can make it happen, if I don't make it rappin
This lump of Satan I'm packin thrash 'em with a major passion
I slash ya face and fracture you flashin in the latest fashion
And have you dashin from Manhattan all the way to Aspen
Your shit is whack, heard your tape and had to take an aspirin
Step ya game up

[instrumental break]

[unknown Get Low male]
Listen, before I get up in the mornin I ask the Lord for strength
Tryin to get my niggaz out the hood, you know how the forces get
It's like the devil got a hold of my neck
And I'm gettin this change runnin 'round reppin my set
Momma used to look at me funny; she could tell her baby boy changed
Must be out there gettin some money
But it's a price for everything, you know how the game go
For them birds niggaz'll cock back the calico
Now you introduced to the beef, what'chu gon' do now?
Bitch up, skid in your crib, or pull them tools out?
A lot of niggaz is real, a lot of niggaz is fake
A lot of niggaz shake your hand and shake hands with Jake

[another Get Low male]
Fuck what'chu heard, I startled your brain
I hit the spot like a {?} in ballers and jeans
On some eighty-eight shit, more "Raw" than Kane
It's not my fault she looked at me - you better talk to your dame
That's just, part of the game and you got served
Who got nerve cause Lethal hard like Tupac words
And, why y'all Chucks always actin like tough guys
You must be trippin or you slippin on mudslides
And in the hood you see it's different from one time
What's your bloodline, play the strip to the sunshine
And I don't even know why I'm wastin my breath
I oughta be like Makaveli and be fakin my death
I keep that good shit it's tastin so fresh
And all y'all sloppy Joe niggaz yo y'all makin a mess
We on the way to yo' nap, so put your tapes in the deck
And spit in a hundred bars straight without breakin a sweat


Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

[The Game]
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh

[The Game]
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker

[The Game]
All my niggaz listen, huh
I stay a step ahead of the rest of y'all
Why I gotta keep a vest for y'all
Though I made it dog I still stress for y'all
Funny how my folks think rap money stretch so far
Pray to God my niggaz see through all the checks and the cars
I'm tryin to invest in what's ours, gimme a couple of years dog
I'll turn your tears stress and your scars
into lawn chairs and green grass in your yard
I'm tryin to watch my kids wrestlin yours
Not have to get 'em ready for school and strap a vest on 'em all
I know sometimes it get hard
Keep your head up mami, reach for the stars
Havin a child is like a blessing from God
You just gotta work hard, can't let your youngest star strip in that bar
I feel your pain, this shit is rippin my heart
But where and when do we start, listen to the voice in back of my mind
Can't reach all my women so I attack it in rhyme
I know what you're feelin, I'm wripin ya tears ma, it could happen in time
For now I take your tear strife sufferin, imagine it mine, huh


[19 second instrumental to open]

[Sky]
Who's hot, who's not; I been the hottest thing
on the West, ever since the death of Tupac
Kept my crack in clear capsules with blue tops
And it's still nothin for me to get you shot
You see him?  Yup, the same ol' pimp
Sky baller, and ain't nuttin changed but my limp
Natural born player, mine not a lame or a simp
The world is mine, you see my name on a blimp
Stay Dolce Gabbana'd down, play the Bahamas now
Youse a donkey, I'ma piranha clown
I keep thick bread, in the pockets of my sweats
While I'm drivin I get head in the cockpit of my 'Vette
And my game is sharp as a mosquito's needle
As far as the charts, young S be's the Beatles
Purple haze smoke in the urr, blow in the wind
The rims right there when I stop they still go and they spin
I can teach you how to stunt boy, and pop that trunk boy
Them city slickers ain't never been punks boy
So fix your ice grill, and your mean mug
Unless you wanna feel a few M-16 slugs

[Chorus 2X: The Game]
Nigga you got a blunt then put it in the air
Nigga you got a gun then put it in the air
Nigga you from a gang then put in in the air
Play with Killa Cali if you want, muh'fuckers

[The Game]
I ain't got no time for fake ones, so don't think for a second
I won't pull this 45 and put your stomach where your neck is
If I tell you kiss the sky better respect it
Or get yo' ass hog-tied, butt-ass naked
I'm doin this for Eazy, like it or not
I wouldn't even be rappin if Eric Wright wouldn'ta dropped
I love this shit, I work and I'm good
I ain't on corner fuckers but I'm still in the hood
I'm poised to go platinum, that's what the magazines sayin
Fuck The Source, I got my own magazines man
I call her Shirley, she got a 32 round clip
And she love hangin out wit'chu girlies
I'm like them Philly nigs that come through "Early"
Through your front door without knockin like Mr. Furley
It's just me, you and the semi - "Three's Company"
You want the crown, you be U.G.K. like Bun B

[Chorus]

[Sky]
I rock jewels, cop tools, I will not lose
A million miles a minute is how my block moves
I stay in the fast lane, never fakin, cheddar chasin
I'm in the game for the cash mayne
And bitches play this in they Benzes, Jeeps and G.O.'s
They say I'm arrogant and got a big ego
But they still love to swallow me up
And every hotel suite, they wanna follow me up
But I ain't gon' put my dick in for free, nah ma
You want the kid then you gotta pay this pimpin a fee
And ain't no champagne left, so let's toast 'gnac
Sky baller and Game 'bout to bring the West coast back
I'm on that get dough shit, that Frank War{?} pimpin that ho shit
In Cali smokin that 'dro shit
I still push fishscale, and china white
A lil' nigga with a big gun and I ain't tryin to fight

[Chorus]


[The Game]
You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. fitted velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converts dog
Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin
Only difference is the whores is watchin
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee from the C-P-T
Run with the (Pound) like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

[JT]
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
Avi jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face, and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin through the spacious skies
Strap yo' body with them K's and ride, the handle is up
Switchin gears, hit the pedal and ride

[Chorus]

[The Game - fading out]
I'm a shining star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so...


[JT]
G-Man Stan, yeah mayne
I see you done put together one of them tracks mayne
Let me get on down here to the C-P-T
Better known as Compton mayne
Get my young homey The Game, y'knahmean?
Young nigga up outta Compton mayne, y'knahmsayin?
This 2002, we gon' see what it do mayne
Y'knahmean?  Yarra

[The Game]
Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton!) Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around
A nigga just be hatin and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city

[Chorus: JT]
Where they actin a fool, and they carry the tool
Them sick dudes in the streets of Compton
Where I found The Game, he was stackin his change
to maintain in the streets of Compton
Took a trip to the Sco, got low for the dough
In Fillmoe from the streets of Compton
Now we stackin the bread, never run from the feds
They shed treads in the streets of Compton

[The Game]
See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
That's how I'm livin, I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody know, that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog
'til I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.
Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly
Cause niggaz gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win
Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N

[Chorus]

[JT and Game ad lib shoutouts]


[Chorus 2X: The Game]
Real gangstas stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggaz sit down to piss - what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply cause I'm mad at you

[The Game]
Y'all niggaz see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
that them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
that'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggaz thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggaz with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggaz next to each other how I do 'em in line

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke?  Bet the S-5 pink on it

[Chorus]


[The Game]
Niggaz don't really want it, just talkin out the side of they neck
How many gangsters you know, ain't scared of death
That's why I, ride with tecs, soon as I pull 'em out
breathe easy nigga they tryin to get them bullets out
It was all good a week ago, you was callin shots in the hood
Bitch now you so {?} the hood
Used to be a gang leader, now your gang need ya
But no more rocks or dope spots in the hood
Ghost town, niggaz won't even walk in your hood
I want respect like when niggaz is talkin to Suge
You cats gon' get with that, or get with the +Mac+
And I ain't talkin 'bout +Beans+, talkin 'bout this gat
The kid still a hundred miles and runnin
Niggaz smoke 10 boxes of Newports, when they know I'm comin
And fuck MTV, I live in +The Real World+
Call my guns R. Kelly, they'll touch your lil' girl, cause

[Chorus 2X: JT]
Layin with dogs, you gon' wake up with fleas
Fuckin with rats, you'll never get yo' cheese
You know J cats, like to sell you dreams
And a snake gon' scheme (and a killa will do anything)

[JT]
It's a done deal, Seth's back, makin it hot
No questions, I'm takin my spot
Project walls, hoods and blocks, Get Low, we hard to stop
JT, and the Game is hot
It's so necessary, these dudes are so scary
When I cruise through Bentley Coupe that's cherry
Tailored suits and gators, man, laughin at these haters
Man, show me the money then, pay me man
It's a new day, same team, I'm still the ghost
Big crib, jet skis and boats, listen close take notes
Mink coats and diamond clusters
West coast we nothin but hustlers
We grimy and gritty, cool like dat, old school fools
Willy Ness throwbacks, we send tricks to the nearest track
Who you know that's as real as that?
I pimp this game like Goldie the Mac, holla back

[Chorus]


[JT]
Get Low Records motherfucker
Bringin the best to the table
Bluechip, Nina B, {?}, what it is
JT Get Low motherfucker that's what it is motherfucker
Yeah, who fuckin with us nigga
Now (what goes around comes around)
I'm puttin this clique up nigga against all you niggaz
Now get it right

[Verse One: Bluechip]
Hey yo, this is where I see me in this game
Benz Coupe, Maserati, plus I got your bitch all in the Range
And y'all niggaz ain't gon' do shit, soon as your crew spit
My tool spit, metal to your side, watch you lose hips
And I ain't want to take it there but fuck it we can bang
My Cali headbusters'll show you how to throw them things
I'm too connected like John Gotti and Nino
For a small fee they find your body wreakin out in Reno
I know the niggaz that sell weight, and niggaz that stick the niggaz
that sell weight, hammer close behind me like when you tailgate
I know you a snitch, I can see it in your eyes
Shackled up, D.O.C.'s, all my niggaz on that ride
You can, stunt if you wanna, Chip is a gunner
Been reignin/rainin since ninety-six now it's time for the thunder

[Verse Two: Nina B]
In your mind you can blame me but open your mouth and name me
I'm runnin you out of office you're softer than Bush and Cheney
Go 'head, and try to play me I do you like I was Amy Fisher
Smokin a Swisher like I wish a bitch would
Listen and use your vision cause livin in this - hood
And sinnin in your division you think it's all - good
Got niggaz on (Death Row) and it ain't about Suge
Niggaz that stay home they scared to come out shook
Mothers with five kids and all of 'em got took
It's right in these niggaz face, but they just will not look
I'm tired, of the B.S. I'm cheatin {?} some rejects
Even though we make the best of what little respect, we get
This is the life, that was given to me
A rich-ass bitch that's what I'm fittin to be
Brooklyn to Bangkok I'm beggin to be
And don't nobody write, what I'm spittin but me
Nina B

[Chorus: JT]
We 'bout to blow this bitch
Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what
We 'bout to blow this bitch
Niggaz work hard in the game so they notice this, what
Underground with it, poppin collars now
Bust yo' shit nigga, put them guns down
Put yo' knuckles up, catch you slippin dawg
That's how we do it independent now we 'bout to ball

[Verse Three]
For years niggaz sold me dreams that got me gassed
Made me want to get revenge or get the hockey mask
Got beef? Yo the burner's in the lobby stashed
Get your crew if you want, all them niggaz is probably ass
I take the long way, fuck takin the shortcut
Now we got corporate sponsorships wrappin our tour bus
A quick 32, yo them shits is like warmups
It ain't coincidental in the hood we was born tough
You chump or get chumped, punk or get punked
Save your lil' craps homey, fuck it get drunk
Was one at the top, but now I'm back at the bottom
Most 'em hate to spit with me cause when I rap I surprise 'em
Shit is real, that's why I stay strapped with a condom
I keep 31 flavors just like Baskin & Robbins
I'm here now, y'all supposed to be stressed, scared to death
that you gonna be next, record labels, promote the rejects
While starvin artists is closest to sets
And certain niggaz duckin me because they owe me a check
I spit more heat, than a bowl of chili, y'all niggaz know the deally
So turn the music up and roll a Philly

[Verse Four: JT]
Yeah, roll the Philly or Swisher Sweet
And I ain't trippin while you niggaz just stand on your feet
Figgaro done walked in the building, it's time to expand
Comin with hundreds of grands and hundreds of plans
You see this Black Wall Street is for the po' broke and hongry
None of my niggaz on the corner never be lonely
Stuck in the gutter mayne, coke packs like Tony
Bricks and pounds of weed half the city owe me
My shipment too big, frontin out the homies
I ain't even trippin mayne my pockets never lonely
Benjamin Franklins and Grants stick together like
Boys in tough weather makin noise forever, ahhhh

Yeah mayne, it's real shit nigga and we independent nigga
Fuck what'chu heard dawg, independent is where the money is at nigga
Fuck all your major labels nigga, that's what it is
JT the Bigga Figga, Nina B [fades out]


[The Game talking]
The young Roy Jones of this rap shit
Somebody bout to get knocked the fucked out tonight man
You better tell your boy somethin, you better tell him somethin

[Verse 1: The Game]
Skip through the blueprint one bang this what's mentioned
Bleek you're one hit away but he didn't know The Game was pitchin
Balls faster than roger Clemens nigga you're too big for your bitches
Two gold albums and I'll make you a hitter
Might make you a little richer but don't forget the big picture
All of those make you a fag but money like Little Richard
Take your faggot ass picture put it next to Gulliany
Run you for your roc-a-wear fit and beat you with the Tommy
Drag your ass down to Alby Square
Call Beans, Jay, Freeway, Biggs, Dame I'll be there
Compton behind me ask Nas queens is with me
You ain't never sold crack in your life I'm takin your fiends with me
My guns smoke like Robert Downey
Two shots and a pound he got a room in Kings County
And you might live or sit in a box
Depending on how long it NYPD to respond to the shot

[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek

[Verse 2: The Game]
See what the problem is too much east coast dick lickin
And everybody tryin to do their best 2pac rendition
Listen they wonder how I live with 5 shots
Niggaz is hard to kill on my block
When you was in the streets comin of age
I was in the streets pumpin the gauge
While you was rappin I was makin it happen
On the block with a k
While you was with the roc on the stage
I had rocks on the stage
On headliner for the front page we know that you front
You be on sunset doin what? Gettin your punk ass stunt
You gon respect us or that fo' rippin through the vests
And you know who you are deaf nigga'll get the message
Malik or M-E-M-P-H Bleek
Fuck around and be a B-I-T-C-H sleek
Cuz all that yappin dude will get guns clappin dude
And stop Memphis from rappin dude, huh

[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek

[Verse 3: The Game]
It took me a little while but I am now understandin
Jay fucked up in the first round when he picked olo with candy
Did olo in the second, nigga take it from me
The Roc get knocked off the bounce till you picked up beans
Add freeway to the team but move the ugly bitch
Trade the Marcy reject for Cam'ron and Lil' Chris
Now the squad 5 is live 6 man is Neef
Fans in the stand yellin out fuck Memphis Bleek
You want beef I have your body parts all over New York
Leg in jersey arm in Brooklyn head buried in central park
You can't even borrow from New York no more like john Storch
And I ain't talkin to him I'm talkin to Malik
And I got a pine box for a nigga like you
Streets is talkin how many real niggaz like you
Hit LAX remember when you come to the coast
Niggaz don't play with they lives when it comes to the toast

[Chorus: The Game]
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek
Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek...Memph Bleek


[The Game]
Yeh this is killa Cali, live as a motherfucker man

[Chorus: The Game + JT]
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay, our chains hang, L.A. they can't bang
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In L.A. they havin problems, the Bay we pop collars
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop hollows, L.A. they pop hollows
Compton to Fillmore here we go again
In the Bay we pop bottles, L.A. they pop bottles

[JT the Bigga Figga]
They can't cop what the bricks'll cost
But we stay in the lane to maintain in the 6 to floss
Leather gloves with the tips to toss
But the money was made from conversation had to clip the boss
Smash down at the V.I.P.
Street smarts is crucial for young niggaz in the CX-3
Drop Jag with the price to pay
Cause the bags was heavy my chain swangin like a ice capade
Got the feds lookin twice this way
Cause we shuffle the P's in different places that the {?} name
Compton to Fillmoe man the game is real
When you turn 15 get your stainless steel
Whole squad been trained to kill, we official
And switch to get rich now we after the meals
Hard times got cakes for 3
When it's havin a bundle we break bread for the safe and flee nigga

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I got guns, guns, guns, guns
Guns all over the club
We in V.I.P. strapped, security know that
25 deep, guns up under the throwback
That new R. Kelly shit sound like Bobby Womack
Black Wall Street in HURR, nigga where the hoes at
We got sour diesel, three cases of Hypnotiq
And more guns than the Nickerson Projects
Niggaz don't want beef with me
Cause they know they gotta pay for talkin shit but the sheets is free
And ain't nuttin to shoot the club up
You don't want drama in this motherfucker throw them dubs up
Jacob got the wrists on chill
And N.W.A. chain glow like the memory of Ill Will
Relax your mind and let your drawers feel free
You're now rollin to the sound of the Game and JT

[Chorus]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
But you can't come with the rest of her friends
Cause you know I'm a boss and won't play cause she short on my ends
Make rounds from the back of the Benz
With the {?} that kid with frog eyes with the corners to bend
The things we go through I'm beatin ya brains
Got some homies next do' and I picked up the Game
While they knockin on the do' I get deep in ya dame
Gotta charge you a G just for speakin my name

[The Game]
I'm not eatin your chocha or payin for the coach ma
I'm a pimp like 50, the nigga to leave you broke ma
6 in the mornin, you stretchin on the sofa
Singin "Ain't No Nigga" like Foxy Brown and Hova
I fuck 'em dogstyle with Billys and Novas
With or without chaffeurs, I make 'em fuck the both of us
You know what it is, the gangster's back
And I keep my banger at where my chain hang at
I'm ghetto

[Chorus x2]


Uhh, uhh, gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, it's gangsta gangsta yeah
Uhh, uhh, shit I'm livin gangsta gangsta shit
Yeah

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm from Compton, Compton, Murderville
You heard these niggaz is gangsters, and they kill
Rob and steal, my niggaz will peel at will
For real they real, niggaz gon' feel this steel

[The Game]
Walk with me through the ghetto where the packs get sold
And them niggaz sellin the work ain't half as old
as the fiends and the hippies, same ones smokin since the 60's
Everybody yellin gimme, gimme
Every nigga in the hood, one hand on his jimmy
Other hand grip the semi, c'mon walk with me
Every ten houses, one got 'caine for sale
And I give you a dope track like my name Phar-rell
And you can get that stainless steel
Walk in my Chuck Taylors for a day, if you think it ain't f'real
When I buy rocks homey baguettes on my ring
And only neighborhood watch is my Tecno Marine
Keep a (Mac) on the block, I ain't talkin 'bout Beans
QB in the hood and I'm far from Queens
The boys in the hood is always hard
So come through and get smoked like a Cuban cigar

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I'm from Compton, Compton, a block from hell
And you can come get a bird for eleven
And we ain't got a penny for the reverand, a dime for a witness
Only (Church's) in the hood sell chicken (ba-KAW)
Every nigga in the hood sell chickens move work like city buses
You fuckin with the Hub City Hustler
The vans on the block won't touch us, the streets my home
So I move weight on the block like I'm Moses Malone
Bring the guns anywhere I roam, go with the chrome
And I hit all my shots, like I'm in the A.I. zone
And mob like Al Capone through N.W.A.'s home
Homes like Ed Jones will cripple your team up
In the home of Dr. Dre, Venus and Serena
Where 14-year-olds pack ninas and drive Beamers
We ball up subpeonas, take niggaz to the cleaners
And you know what I'm talkin about if y'all seen where..

[Chorus]

[The Game]
We drug dealin, but niggaz is squealin (fuck you rats)
What more can I say, just kill 'em
Fuck 'em, the gun bust 'em, we just knock on wood
Now is this under-stooooooood?
I mostly George when I whip, my supply is good
The man behind the bricks, I'm supplyin the hood
Catch bodies like Pistol Pete passes on the wood
Benz parked by the fence, brick stashed in the hood
Top work by the inch, I bag it, it's gone
Ask Quik, we rock more than microphones
Some niggaz ball, some niggaz do what we do
And other niggaz sing for Cash Money like TQ
The block will heat and sink you (hey dude)
Cali ain't all palm trees, purple haze and sea dude
Lose your life tryin to get these jewels
I keep the 40 cal wrapped in chrome like R2-D2

[Chorus]


[Intro/Chorus - sample]
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..
-- Don't cry [5X] don't..

[The Game]
Amayah wake up baby
I know you're sleepin, but daddy's home now
Pictures gettin old, my lil' girl lookin grown now
Your moms said you're talkin on your own, walkin on your own now
Run across the kitchen floor in them baby drawers
I sent you from off tour and I miss you when I was tourin
Smilin at them baby pictures, so happy, tears pourin
God how can somethin so beautiful come from me?
After the gunshots thought you was done with me
But I know I'm livin now, why you made me put the guns down
Pick up the mic, start rappin for a living now
My sun, my moon, my starts, my earth
My wind, my fire, my life, my bay-bay
Tryin to make your moms life ya must be crazy, fussin and fightin
I know she love me cause ya look just like me
Day you came into this world I was so excited
Eleven twenty-one double-zero, my baby girl is here

[Chorus]

[Blue Chip]
Yo, yo, you see this rap shit I do it for you
And the first time I heard your voice I prayed to God it had to be true
Got a son now, cuttin the game, stoppin the bullshit
Remember eyein your enemy, can you pull quick
Dipped out Cali, came back, snatched my son
my girl moms and I moved out Maui
Yeah your pops gone bananas, seen wild went hard
Bigger house, wider yard, nappy with the crash bar
Off that hersh', shit you stupid, you ain't no dad nigga
Takin your black ass to court for all you have nigga
You see me and your moms, that's another topic
Ain't no whip in this world with a price you can't cop it
Stop it, press rewind, you didn't hear me right
It's a lesson to the song, I'm tryin to steer you right
Just remember your father taught you to go hard or go home
Never sing that sad song, don't cry

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Huh daddy ain't gon' preach to you, I'ma let your moms school you
Don't let the streets fool you, streets'll do you, that's why I'm talkin to you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, you see these niggaz out here, have you stressin by the hour
Never turn your back on your foes, them dudes cowards

[The Game]
Some days sweet, and some sour - but we gon' make it together
The world is ours, and you're my flower

[Blue Chip]
If it's ice you can get that, model chicks hit that
Never stress about the downfalls just 'bout the getback

[The Game]
And I ain't sayin sex is wrong, just make sure he strap a condom on
And never, ever do it in your mother's home

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, never call a girl a bitch, show respect, son pop ya collar
Ain't nothin free, scrape and lock every dollar

[The Game]
And I will leave you with this, my lil' angel, daddy loves you
How I'd die for you, cry for you, ride for you

[Blue Chip]
Yeah, switchin handles like you breakin a zone, candy paint Impala
On the Golden Bridge, bouncin on chrome

[Chorus]


[20 second instrumental to open]

[San Quinn]
Drama is real, like not wakin up
I'm breakin up grounds when this patriot thrust
Your mouth is on shut, your emotions are hidden
For you to handle your business, you are more than driven
If you kill it no more standin on that corner like a stop sign
Everytime you spotted they call it shot time
Not at the gym but in the grim reaper's hands
You important if a bullet hits, injure your plans
This is not an adventure, but a full-time duty
If you seen how niggaz hit the club, they pullin out uzis
Sometimes bruisin and grazin, mostly takin
No more sleep for the shooter, no more of that hangin
No mo' trustin hoes you ain't know fo' ten plus
No mo' smokin with the homies, no mo' late night clubs
Cause the victim, is ready to stick him like a mousetrap
I'm 'bout to rap, you better be 'bout peepin out cash

[Chorus: The Game]
If there's blood on my Nikes I done murdered a nigga
If the stash spot smokin I done murdered a nigga
San Quinn got a hurt for the nigga, it get worser for niggaz
We take this beef shit further than niggaz
Streets are shady, the Game got curtains for niggaz
All-of-a-sudden-ass killers never heard of these niggaz
Have your whole family cryin a river, we'll murder you niggaz
We take this beef shit personal nigga

[The Game]
I ain't met a nigga yet could fuck with this rap vet
I'm the realest since I came in the game on Kam back
Rest in peace to Mausberg, gotta live with that
Keep the M2 on my hip, I live with that
Eat with that, sleep with that, come get me
Four-fifty put somethin through your son Easter basket
Six in your truck, get you each a casket
Put termites in your box let 'em eat your cabbage
A wife right here, see if she can weave through traffic
Everybody gotta die, when the beef is active
If you know Game, you know I'll never give free passes
But I give choices, how you want it, metal or plastic
Life is real, pedal to traffic, no spots on my tail
Cops on the payroll so me and Quinn live well
And I can still get a nigga the hill, your bitch as well
Shotgun got mo' punks than shells

[Chorus]

[The Game]
See the Escalade got 'em runnin downhill, snowball niggaz
We throw vapors out of truck windows, blow our figures
Suede corners out the sunroof, the fifth or the Ruger
Broad daylight, blow the windows out of your Cougar
Move in the S5, plus my, leather dust fly
Spark up a dutch, Game put niggaz in a coffin too much
Turn niggaz kids into orphans too much, In God We Trust - nah
Keep the fifth close like Starsky & Hutch
Your daughter cryin it's just {?} tuck, but so what
Blow the dutch, southpaw bust out your whole fronts
Have you eatin soup for months, broken jaw, lick your shit out of straws
I guess I got that same ol' harm
I ain't for play, the Game is raw
Specialize in death jackets, here try these bullets on
And next time have all my cheese cause if you owe me
Guns O-U-T, we all gon' squeeze

[Chorus]


[13 second street fight instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Death before dishonor
Ride with weap' up, cause niggaz tryin to dent my armor
Cold streets, Telly Mac keep the guns on 'em
They wanna know how that nigga from California
could run up on ya on any corner
Put somethin on ya
How I stuff bricks in the 6, with no crack aroma
Dawg, I'm just livin for the moment
I'm from Compton homey, but I'm like a center for Milwaukee
Cause I play for the Bucks, and I keep the 40 on me
Gotta keep the chrome-y, gotta keep my back to the wall
Wait for Q to rock me up, like cavi dawg
Speakin of lle', I put 8 in, 10 jump back hard
And watch my money come back, like Jordan in charge
I'm like the black Yankees, they don't want me around no more
Cause I hold the record for the most fiends roamin the boulevard
And when I'm on the boulevard, catch me behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill

[Chorus x2]
Steppin out of Chevies with heat that's heavy - that's president
Bullets flyin for them dead guys - that's president
Led meltin inside your wig - that's president
20's 50's and 100's burnin - it's all president

[Telly Mac]
Aiyyo I do this shit from Compton to the Mac block
High-tech collaborations with the Gamblaz and Blacksox
Drillin 'em killin 'em if we ain't feelin 'em nigga
If Sticky Fingaz need some music straight stealin it nigga
Shinin, in big trucks, big will in it nigga we climbin
To the top and we sealin it nigga
So back the fuck up, my niggaz act the fuck up
So keep yourself in line or you could get smacked the fuck up
Jacked the fuck up, beat up bad and clapped the fuck up
Wrapped up in white sheets and threw in a white truck
Over presidents, now you willin to give your life up?
Put your kids on the line, and give your wife up?
Over presidents, they got you soulless
So take this bomb and hold this, while we control this
For the streets, we comin with heat that's stolen
And we hustle universal, for that paper that we foldin
Roll in 600's, Beemers and 'llacs
We a team of cats, with the pens and gats
That fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached
We fiend for jacks, but only when the green's attached

[Chorus]

[The Game]
It's Telly and young Game the hustler, ho juggler, coke smuggler
No matter what the hustle, dough doublin
Lle or the rock, give me a day and a spot
And I bet I'll come back with 10K in the drop

[Telly Mac]
I'll stay in the spot, wearin a crop and coppin ounces
Telly Mac and Game the hustler, we rock the house
And plus we the reason that the blocks is out
So my words to the wise is just watch your mouth

[The Game]
And you don't want it when the stainless out, what the game about
The bullets is in, your brains is out
All over Frisco and Compton dawg, we ruthless
And the truth is y'all niggaz can't stop us dawg

[Telly Mac]
So why the fuck you wanna knock us off
Like we some high-powered cowards and y'all really the niggaz that's soft
Still across the train tracks, we turn 'caine crack
It's Telly Mac and Game the hustler, you can't change that

[Chorus: to fade w/ Digital Underground ad libs]


[Chorus: repeat 2X] 
Exclusively, ridin on them deuces G 
Talkin 'bout what your gameplan used to be 
They got us choppin up game through the fog and smoke 
We came a long way but still we got so far to go 

[Verse One] 
Yeah I know I got 4 to go, so with these bars I flow 
At a pace for the papes I thank y'all should know 
I lace it properly for property, it really ain't no stoppin me 
And plus I'm tryin to get my money on like Monopoly 
Politickin economy, if I could be a made nigga 
Smokin on e'ry nigga, balled out paid nigga 
Keepin it real, I'm still deep in the field 
Deep with the skills for the bills 
I got the million dollar mouthpiece with no gold grill 
I bring the thrill like Will Clark 
I will bust I will spark and flame in the booth 
You blind you shoulda saw it when I came in the booth 
I serve the thunder, that shit that'll brang in the roof 

[Verse Two] 
My niggaz, stack riches, mack bitches 
Blow fast Swishers with my folks, act vicious with my folks 
Sav livin with my vo-cals, Outlaw like my nigga No-ble 
Fuckin bad bitches at the hotel 
There's nothin to a boss, man we live it up 
Smash for the cash and respect so when we mash niggaz give it up 
I got no time for that fake shit 
Jersey to the Bay niggaz thuggin even bitches thinkin they sick 
So nigga basically the world is a ghetto 
Play a nigga out his scratch, he gon' be twirled in a meadow 
I keep it real with niggaz that be true to me 
There's nothin you can do to me 
My crew is deep and real niggaz rule the streets 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Three: The Game] 
Lace your Timbs, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas 
You can't ball then it's probably the haters 
Can't breathe then it's probably the desert, if you a gangster or not 
I give a fuck dawg, bullets is hot 
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit 
The more pain the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit 
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know 
if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit 
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this 
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that "Cali Love" shit 
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6 
Fuck you up like one time'll do 
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard 
Pull it hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw 
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket 
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it 

[Verse Four] 
It's time for me to shine, life on the grind, life on the line 
Feelin like I'm runnin out of time 
It's now or never, chasin this cheddar 'til things get better 
These streets got me hungry as ever 
Can't stop can't change, young Sav stuck in the game 
Everyday we gotta hustle and slang, struggle and strain 
to bubble, weed plus the 'caine to juggle 
Organize the brains and muscle 

[Chorus] 

[Verse Five] 
You {?} like Sammy did Gotti, told 'em we kamikaze 
Like those whiteboys ain't heedin the robbery 
Told 'em we ride around in them cars on them big wheels 
In the killing field makin 100 bills on the P-700 Pirelli wheels 
Marshall Faulk in to ball again in this day to day scrimmage 
'Bout the spinach this game is relentless where we livin 
Niggaz'll 32 round ya, kick you on the ground 
After they down ya, sneak ya and plot ya, Heckler & Koch ya 
Got ya body bein scrutinized by a flock of doctors 
Still an unsolved mystery, statistically, history 
A Get Low nigga victory by fuckin with my credibility


[19 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Live now, die later, flood or clock the shit out of haters
Got niggaz tryin to "Kiss the Game Goodbye" like Jada
Get your shit pushed back like Jada's CD
I'll put your brains on that Kenwood TV
So you can see hell in 3D, it's right there dog
And the Game behind the Desert is a nightmare dog
If it's pussy, I might share it dog, beef I'm right here dog
I'm on the block, white Nike Airs on
Gucci check, Coogi sweat, they wanna know
if 22's on the truck, give me coochie yet
But I come through in the new GS with two, three tecs
Got niggaz Harlem Shakin like the new G. Dep
Tryin to read my whole script, but ain't seen the movie yet
Better have that glock stuffed tonight
I'm comin through with Young Noble, and we, gon', make, it
A block bust tonight

[Chorus 2X: The Game]
Getting American Money Easy, all I know
The Gangsta All Motherfuckers Envy, all my dough
It's a West coast knot, watch, let it bang out
Shots range out, for all the gangsta hangouts

[The Game]
Lace your tips, polish your gators, we like odds in Vegas
You can't ball? Then it's probably the haters
Can't breathe then it's probably the Desert, if you a gangsta or not
I give a fuck dog, bullets is hot
And every nigga gon' cry when he hit, the more pain
the more blood drain, he ain't survivin shit
And your niggaz ain't gon' ride for shit, they know
if they came through everybody in the X-5 is hit
Red rag or blue rag, niggaz die for this
The Game the reason all these niggaz on that "Cali Love" shit
Compton niggaz get grimy too, pull you out of that 6
Fuck you up like one time'll do
And I dare y'all to stop on the 'Shaw, and King Boulevard
Comin hard, Doogie Howser pullin bullets out your jaw
Turn your round trip into a one-way ticket
You can visit, but you can not lie and kick it

[Chorus]

[Young Noble]
Aiyyo, we left a stain on your block, you came with a cop
Pointin fingers at them niggaz, that kept shit hot
Next to 'Pac, I'm the hottest thang out, homey we can bang out
Outlaw air it out, box 'em in, square it out
Learn about your whereabouts and we right there
Me and Game have you left right there
N-O-B-L-E, O-U-T-L-A-W-Z
We bubble with ease, and I double my cheese
I got niggaz out in Compton that'll find yo' ass
I got niggaz out in Jersey, that'll hide yo' ass
for a long time if you ever fuckin with mine
It's a thin line dog between the real and the fraud
We killin your squad, my homeboy still in the yard
You the type of motherfucker standin next to the God
The Game is deep, you motherfuckers ain't the streets
Young Noble and the homey Game flamin heat, c'mon

[Chorus]


[The Game]
I'm from Compton where them guns bust, watch Poppa George pop
Cats tellin jokes at them car games
Seen big face hundreds, handle the rock like Nate Archibald
What? This nigga only sixteen
And I wanted to be, just like him, middle school fightin
Any nigga with a chip on his shoulder, whattup nigga?
You want beef with me? Now I let the heat speak for me
No more talkin, just outline chalkin
Nigga Witta Attitude from birth, "100 Miles and Running"
Gunnin bustin shots like fuck the cops
Notorious for burnin blocks, weavin in and out of traffic and chop
Game the young Robin Hood of the block
Steal from the rich, give to the poor, coward niggaz rock
Second comin of this black Alfred Hitchcock
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
Ten shots to your spleen, let them violins sing

[Chorus: Blue Chip + (The Game)]
Yo, I'm just a ghetto nigga stuck in this game, young'uns runnin with 'caine
Rain hits so we floodin the game
When you come to Compton respect the grounds, leave you shook man
(And I look good, from Compton to Brooklyn)
Hey yo I don't give a fuck who you are, fuck ya ice
Fuck the block that you claim, fuck your Bentley Azure
(Dead presidents is all I represent)
('Til y'all met me y'all niggaz ain't met gangsta yet)

[The Game]
Fast cars, money and muscle, the hustle I was brought up in the 80's
Gangbangin, dope traffic, shit get crazy
From where niggaz grow up hard like dicks raised
Them hustlin guns like Knicks players, we got mouths to feed
'Til they put flowers on me, moms kiss my cold cheek
In that pine box, I'm buyin rocks, eyein cops
Fuck a cell block, the young kid makin it happen
Who you think got them fiends runnin back like Bo Jackson?
I'm a gangsta, what else could I say?
I'm ahead of myself like it's Y4K
2Pac, Scarface, N.W.A.
Taught me how to dodge them bullets, keep my wig in play
Keep fo' snug in the waist or pay a thousand to have 'em
Niggaz in the street move faster than, Michael Jackson's album
But the shit don't really matter to me, we get better G
Bet the four slow 'em down like PCP

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Real gangsters never talk shit, handle they business
Fuck the dry snitchin and bitchin, niggaz die when them bullets fly
Who fuckin with him, ha?  Not a nigga alive
End up dead in that 5
He got no sympathy for them dead guys, friend or foe
Watch that chest cave in, what that vest savin?
Make it sloppy for the autopsy, leave my enemies in a frenzy
On the frontlines holdin a 9
Everyday a new chapter, my own niggaz plottin on me
Tryin to hit me but they won't get me, feel the semi first
Fuckin with my dough, is the worst way to go
Y'all know, niggaz cry when them bullets burn slow dummy
In and out of spots watchin my money
If one dollar come up missin bodies start to come up missin
No one too heavy for the Expedition, piss on your corpse
Watch your soul shiver, throw him in the river, bitch nigga

[Chorus]


[The Game]
You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. city velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in Converse dog
Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin
Only difference is the whores is watchin
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee, from the C-P-T
Run with the (Pound) like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

[JT the Bigga Figga]
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face, and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin gears with the pedal and ride

[Chorus]

[The Game]
I'm a shining star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so
Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me?  Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.

[Chorus]

[JT]
Yeah mayne, I told y'all mayne
Fillmoe California nigga where we launch the best nigga
JT the Bigga Figga, San Quinn, D-Moe the Yungsta, Seff the Gaffla
Introducin the Game
Nigga the first nigga I went and got outside of the Fillmoe district
Y'knahmtalkinbout?  Yeah mayne
And we gon' pass him on off to Aftermath Records mayne
So they can take him to the T-O-P
Y'knahmtalkinbout Dr. Dre and the whole Aftermath staff, y'knahmtalkinbout?
But this album right here, this a Get Low, JT the Bigga Figga production
My nigga Charlie-O on the beat, y'knahmtalkinbout?
And we keepin it real thuggish mayne, Bay Area style nigga
Black Wall Street, now let's get MONEY!


[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Real gangstaz stand up, hold they dick
Bitch niggaz sit down to piss, what type of nigga is you?
I'm the type to pack a gat or few
Pull out and pop, simply cause I'm mad at you

[The Game]
Y'all niggaz see me when I'm come through; and ain't no denyin
that them big motherfuckers is twenty-five
Swayin in and out of white line, six double-oh
Deuce zeroes, I'm feelin like the streets is mine
Mines hustle, mucho dinero, heat's confined
See more fall guys than Foreman/Ali combined
If there's beef, I'm releasin mine
And I won't stop bustin 'til them Escalade seats recline
The kid roll with a greasy nine, come through and blast
I return shots like Arthur Ashe
You do the math, ten shots, ten dead bodies
Fuck bein sorry, it ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
And I'll make sure ain't a nigga survivin
Shoot up the ambulance, make sure it ain't a nigga there to revive him
And the Game ain't tryin to win, fuck the awards
So keep that little-ass horn, and that Neil Armstrong nigga

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Trust me dog, ain't shit you can put in your rap
that'll make you a gangsta, you a bitch and that's that
Niggaz thinkin I retired my Chuck, put the gun back in the holsters
Cause I weave through traffic in a roaster
But that don't stop the heater from bangin, or me comin through
Droppin all y'all niggaz with three in the chamber
Keep two mac-10's when I'm rollin, one in the changer
One when I push the button's right next to the cupholder
Dog we can get this shit over, I got ten on the Game
Let's say that Lee Harvey crack ya brain
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder, I'm good with the aim
Good with the handle and the bullet's good with the bloodstains
And the coroner's real good with that pickup
A1 good with the carpet cleaning, they can get the rest of that shit up
Cause I kill like the hiccups, two at a time
Put you niggaz next to each other how I do 'em in line

[Chorus]

[The Game]
Come through in a big boy, leave the bullshit at home
If beef cook then I'm bringin the chrome
If I die then I'm leavin a clone; but if I live
through the drama one mo' time then them boys gotta dig
When I think about who shot me, I listen to Big
When I'm rhymin on the road, I listen to Jig
Bump Nas off that purple, sittin on the block
And when I'm loadin up them clips, I listen to 'Pac
A semi with me like Eddie Murphy, got mo' guns
than F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S got jerseys
And you might get 'em all in the face when shit get thick
Make the back of your head look like Jerome Kearsey
And ain't nuttin to do a driveby in the hood
We ain't even got survival, but I'ma still take that ride
Bet my drink on it, bet my main squeeze mink on it
Think this shit a joke?  Bet the S-5 pink on it

[Chorus]


Fuck it, yo, who the best MC on the west?
By far it's me and in my car is a continental tea
And my broad in that continental suite
With the armadillo rollin' up dutches like that motherfuckers

Beef with the kid, click clack, motherfuckers
Let them bullets burn your six pack, motherfuckers
Get jacked, motherfucker, when you come to Compton
Get a mack, motherfucker, when you come to Compton

I walk through Times Square holdin' my Johnson
A cross style Jada make a run threw Yonkers
I got D-blocks like the locks and these glocks like to pop
And nigga I like your watch, so roll over, you can die with the jury

First nigga, take the stand to testify he gonna die with the jury
And I might kidnap the judge or send a team
To lean on the prosecutors so the DA budge
I got niggas that'll ride for a grand

So handover my rock like Earl Manson
You can die where you stand
You got his back you can die with your man
I'll let you jog for about 30 seconds then you gunned down

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime you want us then come and try us

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime, you want us then come and try us

I'm a take it to the next, take it to a motherfuckin' neck
Pull up on a nigga holdin' triggers and techs
We droppin' square beads, you easy to read
This is the end of the road for whole ass MC's

Smoke grass by the pound, glock holds 17 rounds
And the flow'll knock any nigga down
Rap you like a burrito come threw and kill you and your people
Said them that I shitted on you nigga like I was a flock of seagulls

Infrared beam like a traffic jam at night
Handle any man in sight with his hands upon a mic
Wanna light, I got the torch, California up north
For any nigga puttin' flamed on a Porches and never drive on

Bitch, you're gonna die on
San Quinton for and five catch a live one
Bust shots at the clouds, so we can shine some
Get up off your ass and nigga and grind some

You know this GL shit, we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime you want us then come and try us

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime we're touching the streets grinds

Flash fuckers on the tip of the gat
You can put on flat but I'll kill that, I'll open you up like a mat
Even if you heard at I squirted and murdered a man
And these new school nigga talk like we heard of them plans

Seventy-two times 36 millimeters in your mini van
Gettin' off on you nigga and your mini-mans
Only thing runnin' is blood nigga so we gettin' grand
So we will bust your head, nigga, straight through your hand

Or get off in yo ass nigga like Jackie Chan
And when it's all said and done it's a one will stand
Gunnin' this motorbike, feelin' this power man
A 185 miles per hour, man, I stay co-relatin' with the Taliban
I show up, show up, show up, show up

Niggaz talk about money, they forgot the struggle
Playas paint a perfect picture, they forgot the hustle
Pieces of a puzzle, guzzlin' pints, watchin' the moonlight
Turn to sunlight, street more gun fights, penitentiary kites

Seen a man turn to mice than mice turn to man
See my nigga take the stand turn my other mans hand
Got me nauseous in my abdomen, got me servin' grams again
Grams rapped in rubber bands, 22's on them rubbers bands

Slow rollin, 'dro blowin', I'm gettin' rich you see my fro growin'
Ho's knowin' I pimp them to the fullest, respect a gangsta
You can shoot but I eat bullets, I shit missiles
And my eyeballs look like crystals, my shits official
It's more humaro Merofrista

Yo, yo, it's Luke and everything I sit on fat
Niggaz be like oh shit, how a nigga shit on that?
You wanna see me shit on and grit on tracks
Glock with the red paint, puttin' it on hat
Talk about the real thing not the 760

The reason that they took the fair team to get me
You don't want it with my dogs, you got teeni guys
I mean itsy bitsy little bitty weeni guys
I done seen them guys bought as big as my gats
And they ain't even got enough strength to squeeze on that

You want real hard core shit I be's on that
Cop the XLT you put threes on that, put cheese on hats
When luchi seeks squeeze on gats we even leave these on flat
G's messin' low they got g's on that and have
How your momma outside screamin' "Please don't clap"

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime we're touching the streets grinds

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime you want us then come and try us

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime we're touching the streets grinds

You know this GL shit we got G's on the line
Or G's on the squad, all week on the grind
And if you doubt that step up, 'cuz we ain't hard to find
Street kings in our prime you want us then come and try us


[20 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Who really the best rapper since 'Pac got killed
I done answered that question when I copped my deal
Ask yourself when the Game is comin, after next summer
I predict my shit'll drop before the next Howard homecoming
Now who in the runnin, no one, ask the niggaz who want it
I got a four-fifth and it just like me, it stay gunnin
Me and my niggaz stay blunted fogged up in the 600
Guilty as charged, blunts in the air, guns in the doors
It's written, Compton niggaz never run from the law
Plus we get Monopoly money with hotels and a board
So I'll never see a jail, and I'm allergic to bars
Can't sit behind 'em or drink at 'em, so we travel with ours
Poppin Crist' in the 6, like we drivin through Mardi Gras
Thinkin 'bout beads and titties as I roll through the city
And I keep 16 in the clip, and I let 'em all go
like the Lakers did Ellie, Atty and Nick, huh

[Chorus]
When shit get thick, niggaz start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent, cause
When shit get thick, niggaz start dyin
Bodies pop up in dumpsters, mothers start cryin
Payback come through violent, nigga
We hit blocks, bust shots, leave ya whole block silent

[Sean T]
No garbage we smoke molta, move big cocoa
We off the train tracks like the great space coaster
We hit real big and consistant like Sam Sosa
Prepare for war, like United States soldiers
Lock tight and rock right like grey eight oz's
I'll be hittin up spots, in them flip Range Rovers
Before you even try to play, foolish all over
Empty out yo' pockets, turn everything over
We ball out cursin yeah we keep it the sickest
When we roll by the quads in them Z-66's
Big spittin, grip kitten, that big face greed
Always dirty never clean but we live like kings
Legendary like Sting, it's a history to follow
But not known for stingin known for gettin off hollows
Shoot me a glass of Remy, nah fuck it the whole bottle
And watch me act bad and take off, full throttle

[Chorus]

[JT the Bigga Figga]
I'm from a batch where it ain't no cut, we all in
36 on a triple beam scale for meal
Duffle bag on my shoulder my route, through the back of the jet
To bag up baguettes and everybody know it
I'm the iceholder makin the cut, never breakin 'em up
My favorite color is rainbowed up
Ain't a coke dealer, but I got bricks for cheap
Hit the lab for a fo' day block, we got heat
You niggaz can't compete when I walk in the streets
We Get Low, and there's no idea with the info
It's a rule of thumb, let them dudes a come
I'm cruisin some, 20 inch shoes and some
I'm in the widebody XM-5, all my snakes is live
We check your five, the spot where the tec dies
And everybody gotta holla the name
It's JT from the Fillmoe streets to CPT


[The Game]
Who the illest hub dawg you know
Peelin slugs at your mug, dealin drugs in front of the projects
My projects, more scatter, more street
Makin room for more drama, more hustle, more heat
I can show you how to get, American money easy
It's the gangster, all motherfuckers envy
Leave all semi I tote, clips empty
Foes tempt me, I'm seein no penitentiary
Crime scene clean, shells, no prints
Flee the shootout, X-5, no {?}
It's meant for me to survive this gangster shit
Meant for you not to be livin, food for the pigeons
It's rules I'm givin, new lessons for the street
This jungle I'm from B don't breed no weak
Lames that don't know the game please don't speak
You get killed, want me peeled, I'm showin no {?} nigga

[Chorus: The Game (Sean T)]
Every nigga out there claimin to be the illest
I don't know if y'all know let a nigga know I'm lost in the stipulations
Niggaz hatin, everybody waitin for the outcome
Whatever happened to just to rappin?
(Mic graspin, freestyle flow flashin)
(Rippin up tracks and, doin the thang)
(What'chu niggaz know about Sean T and the Game?)
(Who's the illest?)

[Sean T]
I'm off the rack like slabs of ribs, I want it big
I ain't fuckin with kids, I'm after six digit things
Fuck the rings and the tribulations, constant playa hatin
This crimin-al lifestyle, keeps me animatin
Let's turf talk before you niggaz thuggin it up
It don't matter if you Crip'n, or Blood'n it up
Dallas Squad blooded it up, smashin on sight
But he hoppin on haters like BMX bikes
Fuck around with the Squad see unbearable sights
We takin gangster shit to the maximum height
But I'm mainly into bubblin, fat grip doublin
Big heads I'm lovin 'em, you feelin me y'all
Leavin the envious in awe cause I tremendously ball
I'm supported by the Game so you know I won't fall
I'ma execute my options, keep wettin my paws
And come out unscathed with no scratches or flaws
Who's the illest

[Chorus]

[The Game]
They say "Game, you rappin like you from the East coast," meet toast
Gun jammed in your throat, forgot that you spoke
Game got the streets woke young'n, same nigga got the coke runnin
Introduce the new fiends to smack
Pops told me when I was younger, you can't live like that
So I don't listen to pops nigga I listen to Kool G. Rap
Went from hustlin sacks to heavy weight, shufflin crack
Kids and preachers know me, young Game the O.G.
Ask the reverand kept the church from fallin, young'uns from starvin
I'm the project like Marcy or the Nickerson Gardens
Comfortable dawg, Compton to Harlem, any city ghetto or hood
Kick back, blowin, listen to Marvin
Get head, count dough and just sit in the apartment
AK in the sofa, I'm the illest, who come closer
to the late ones or great ones fightin over a crown
Get shot off that throne, who the illest now, huh?

[Chorus]

[Sean T]
Some say the gangster mentality is dead, imagine that
When fools pullin straps out with infrared
We're livin in a time of plagues and corrupt life
When homies in the circle end up all trife
Tryin to shine bright, but lookin all dim
Meanwhile I stay sharp like a ballpoint pen
I see the smirks and grins but I just laugh
Cause I'm gettin lucrative loot, endless math
If you only knew the half of it, you wouldn't hate
But niggaz just pig and talk shit behind Jake
Man you cain't knock the hustle, I ain't fin' to be greedy
I want an exit out the game kinda like Paul Vitti
I'm tryin to slang CD's in cruise control
Instead of sellin illegal pharmaceuticals
Should I ask for your advice? Like you would know
Fuck it, I'm out to get it, I'm a fool for dough

[Chorus]


[10 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Aight
Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game
I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack [whispered] - Compton
Yeah that's the name of my hometown
I'm goin down, in the town, where my name is all around
And niggaz just be hatin and shit, that's a pity
But I ain't doin nuttin but claimin my city
See my lyrics are double or nothin provin to suckers I can throw 'em
Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go
Not really into freestylin, or tryin to promote violence
But they gotta know about the five-five-fo', so
And that's how I'm livin, I do as I please B
A young gangsta put in work on these Cali streets
And everybody knows that you gotta be stompin
If you're born and raised in Compton

[Chorus]
[quiet scratching:] "Born and raised in Compton"

[The Game]
Nowww Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog
'til I found out, the streets get real dog
'Bout a year ago, somebody musta wanted me to die
Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five
They musta thought that I was gon' play the bitch role
Cause I lived through fo' five six holes
But I ain't goin out like no faggot-ass clown
They found, they couldn't keep a gangsta nigga down
So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker
ass clucker now you're duckin cause you can't stop a Y.G.
Gangsta, cause I'm true to my game
You're lame, and thangs ain't gon' never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Game is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feelin no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest
Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest
A gangsta motherfucker never ceasin to impress
My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest
I'm comin like this and I'm comin directly
Cause niggaz gettin all stirred up, I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone and niggaz can't win
Cause I'm a gangsta from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N


[The Game]
Yo, when I'm out in Oakland, catch me in the silver and black Coupe
With two Desert Eagles and an ounce of glue
When I'm out in San Fran, the P.D. real nervous
Cause they know I'm packin heat under the Willie Mays jersey
Nigga, it ain't nuttin for me to empty a clip
Or wave my guns in the air and just enter ya strip
I know about gangs, had shootouts with plenty of Crips
I sold crack and been out of town with plenty of bricks
So ain't nuttin you can tell me, about the game
Come with beef and leave here without your brains
And I'ma drive upstate and try to bounce this 'caine
In that Shelby the same color as moutanin rain
And you know I got the South clickin
Cause ain't nuttin like niggaz with gold teeth and them down South chickens
So fuck with my D and get found wit'cha mouth missin
This ain't about you and me it's about business nigga

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
It's business never personal, real live on blocks
If we ain't movin the rocks, then we movin the stocks
Cross a hustler motherfucker you'll arrive in a box
It's the true to life struggle 'til we arrive on top

[JT]
They don't understand me, like the Birdman I got candy
Put the herb in, I got family
I'm doin 85, in the 50-mile-an-hour lane
Tryin to handle my business, the Figgaro stack change
Independent tycoons (tycoons) - yeah
My niggaz puff trees, snort coke and chew shrooms
Bad to the bone (to the bone)
And cain't trust a nigga for shit cause Feds on the phone
My whole crew dirty, fuckin with amphetamines
Catch you slippin blow your whole crew to smitharines
Now the streets knowin (knowin)
And I'ma run this shit back with my foot broke like Terrell Owens
Still blowin
Like Mike Jones of the Swishahouse, gold knock them bitches outs
We take trips out to Houston and D.C.
For the West coast, nigga can you feel me?

[Chorus]


[Chorus]
Drop ya thangs and just box
Nigga just drop ya thangs and just box
Nigga just drop ya thangs and just box
Nigga just drop ya thangs and just box

[Verse One: JT]
Yo, I hit the party in my t-shirt and tennis shoes
They all watchin in they Hot Boys and church suits
Actin tough in the club ain't gon' get you home
Gettin drunk off of Patron just gon' get you domed
Still steppin on my shoes, boy this nigga happy
This nigga thank he Lil' Jon and his partner Scrappy
Goin dumb with his bitch so he don't like me
This ain't the South boy, we ain't crunk we go hyphy
You gotta know the rules, player let it go
You get to trippin my nigga you gotta hit the do'
Rollin up this eight-nine gram I'm tryin to make a plan
Tuggin on yo' main bitch hand, tryin to make a friend
This time for escapade only make the tec a-spray
I'm in the parkin lot, standin by the Escalade
You got a problem we ain't fightin like a man
One-on-one with the Fig', get yo' face in the sand, nigga

[Chorus]

[Hook: JT]
Nigga you a bitch wit'cho gun, snitch wit'cho gun
Still get found in a ditch wit'cho gun
Bitch wit'cho gun, snitch wit'cho gun
Still get found in a ditch wit'cho gun

[Verse Two: JT]
Yo, Fig' never play with them guns, no you hear me
Fig' ain't shot nuttin up but kill spirits
Fig' ain't the one to be, scared of the losses
One-on-one fightin for stripes with right crosses
Uppercuts and heatbutts to get a head rush
Bitch niggaz rather kick back, and let they lead bust
I been a pitbull since Fila {?} and Kenny Ken
Used to chuck 'em by the corner sto' whoever win
Them was my O.G.'s, and I was just a B.G.
Whoever want to see me, Figgaro can {?}
But now we got them old niggaz that bust with they tommy
But caught without they tommy get rushed like salami
Cause everybody tired of them R.I.P.'s
We 'bout to bring this fightin back mayne to all our streets
Now, cowards wanna pack and, killers wanna cruise and
Real niggaz stand alone mayne and do what we do
I wanna bust you but homey let me ask you
Why you wanna play with that gun, and make me blast you
Moms all cryin and shit, she gotta ask you
{?} better to save on caskets you dumb nigga

[Chorus + Hook]

[Verse Three: JT]
Oh boy!  Old friends like to make up and get cavi
Hell nah, she in the club wit'cho baby daddy
She got the coat on he bought you for yo' birthday (oh no!)
You kickin back, I'm 'bout to clown him in the worst way (bitch)
Team on preem' like he hangin out with 'Pac brother
And you a boss for not cuttin him with the boxcutter
And it was cool 'til this chick really got to trippin
Spittin drink in yo' face, boy she popped up pimpin (what?)
Zoked out like, fat boy you can't breathe
Bounce back and grab that trick by her fuckin weave
Bring her to the flo', teach her 'bout the Get Low
She gon' really know, mob her on the danceflo'

[Chorus + Hook]

[JT]
Yeah I gotta acknowledge them fo' carloads of HP niggaz
that came to Fillmoe for y'all one-on-ones mayne, and y'all got it mayne
Niggaz put the guns down and after that nigga it was real big
They get stripes for that, nigga, special shoutout nigga
to them three young Sunnydale niggaz
Nigga that was surrounded by ten Fillmoe niggaz mayne
And all y'all wanted was one-on-ones and y'all got it nigga
Stripes for that!

[Chorus + Hook]


[JT]
Three wheel motion around the corner on these niggaz mayne
Smashin down the block, Charlie O beat in the deck
Game, what it do? (What it do?)

[The Game]
They love the way a nigga hop them six-fours and shit
The way I, push buttons make them Diablo doors lift
The way I, stick and move, when I'm behind the wheel
of that new Escalade with the Foreman grill
The way I, peel back niggaz jerseys
It ain't your life, I'm just not a big fan of James Worthy
So wait 'til I see y'all, I'm real surgical with the Ruger
But you won't catch my face on E.R.
But you might catch them dudes from the ambulance
Squattin on top of ya mans givin 'em each CPR
Tryin to get 'em to "Breathe Again" like Toni Braxton
Told y'all 'bout comin to Cali, with them phony accents
Hollywood got movies, but it ain't no actin
So wear that bling to them awards like it ain't no jackers
We chain snatchers (twenty-fo' seven)

[Chorus: JT]
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
Fuckin with this cash - eat ya beats alive
Cause it's all about math - eat ya beats alive
When you're on the West coast - eat ya beats alive
When ya come to the lab - eat ya beats alive
All about this cash - eat ya beats alive
Nigga all about math - eat ya beats alive

[The Game]
It ain't nuttin to spray you faggots
Or have your moms get you a Burberry suit so you look good in that casket
It's [reversed] you faggots, desperado in tact
June, Drago, The Game and D-Mac (holla)
Come through in a grim reaper black Cadillac
Seven-three, ooh-wee, you see, who he
With the ugliest, flows, money hungriest
Oh, the kid got hoes, you ain't know?
Head is never optional, get my whistle, blizzow
Carry pistols, to your Sources and your Grammys
Of course it's that nigga that kick down doors
And leave rooms filled with corpses, Jordan and bloody Air Forces
To get my dough I come back like Air Jordan
Same shot, lil' older, still no nigga can hold him
Stepped back, sold crack let the Compton streets mold him
Big face said I could it, he'll bet you a G

[Chorus]

[JT]
See I'm the nigga with the most flow
Figgaro from killer Cali, reppin Get Low, niggaz know
Independent with my hustle
Couldn't give a fuck money or muscle it's time to bubble
West coast is the place where we holdin it down
Bay area thuggin, they knowin it now
I'm from the home of the Get Low, home of the get dough
Home where they want mo' so niggaz get they pistol
Run up in yo' back do', lookin for the cheddar cheese
Canary wristwatch on celebrities
Diamond bezelled iced out with hella cheese
And every fuckin link is like a masterpiece
Catch 'em slippin comin out the Burger King
Parkin lot project life, we like to spark a lot
Better known as a bandit, niggaz cain't stand it
My whole block gets hard like granite

[Chorus]

[JT] Nigga


[scratched:] "Livin in Compton, California C-A"
Charlie O, drop that hot shit

[The Game]
Motherfucker it's the Game, mister tint the windows wit'cha brain
Since a young'n up and comin, all I did was cop 'caine
They try and change the Game, nigga I still cop 'caine
I ain't moved out the hood, still stay where the cops came
Bitches tryin to throw salt in my name, barbers tryin to part my game
Niggaz tryin to chalk my frame
But I walk on a thin line without scuffin my Chucks
Bad Boyyyyy, and I fuck with Puff
So bring the guns if you want nigga; I'm real good with the glock
And 50 G's say you leave in a box
When I fuck Lil' Kim guess I'm feelin like 'Pac
Niggaz wanna wrestle The Game, guess they feel like The Rock
"It doesn't matter," 745 up and down your block
Hop out with a Nextel, niggaz feel like they shot
It's different in my hood, only time we take shots
is when the Dodgers did good, my niggaz live on the block

[Chorus]
This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters pour the brew
This is for the gangster, in me
This is for the gangster, in you - all my gangsters red and blue

[Verse Two]
I'm worldwide with this gangsta lean, my life's no dream
I got a crew in Jamaica, Queens
Lake Charles up to New Orleans in D.C. I sip
My thugs get crunk off Lil' Flip
State to state many shows I rip, I'm the boss of the Bay
Like Clint Eastwood, make my day
Fine bitches look like Lisa Raye, plot on gettin paid
In the end, all they get is played
Maybe a nut, no Ice Capade
Real dudes is shiesty, I only give jewels to wifey
And I don't give a fuck if you really don't like me
It's in my blood to thug, get ill and hyphy
One of the best I might be, it really don't matter
When I bust, sucker MC's scatter, gettin out of my way
I bust bad bitches night and day
I make classics like Dr. Dre, closed casket from rhymes I say

[Chorus]

[The Game]
... Gon' move in on your rock, say fuck the crisis
And ride with the West we got lower coat prices
You know me the king of L.A., New York
Drivin through Brooklyn in a fo', same color as water
You want X?  I can cover the order
Ninety-fo' been hustlin now watch the shit elevate like Vince Carter
Not the rap martyr, or the second rap Carter
Compton's own, I'm home, not the best I just rap harder
Heir to the throne, nobody rep Compton like me
Street spinnin like waves on that Continental T
My grandmoms woulda been proud of me, look at your grandson now
'Til my demis, Black Mafia ties
So it's hard to let the larcent die, my {?} treys
A killer changin the game like them Marcy guys
And I been compared to Shyne like Shyne was compared to Biggie
I'm from Compton, he from New York City, c'mon really?

[Chorus]


[The Game]
Yo, it's the nigga with the nasty flow and the clean rag six-four
With the D's spinnin I can bag a ho
Top down so my rag can show, whatever in the dutch
Purple or orange haze it's just a bag of 'dro
Hit snatch with my khakis on, Aladdin Lounge
In Mark Jacobs denim and Don Magli's on
I'm a gangsta and the birds they love it
20 with a babyface and sit on base like Kirby Puckett
You can't buy a Ferrari fuck it, cop lle' from J
The bricks come with Louis Vuitton luggage
He order rock and cover it, the dimes is free
The quarters is 75, the ball is live
Ain't nobody fumblin on my block
We in the field like Biggs or Marshall Faulk, we runnin the rock
Nothin less than a hundred a pop, anything less you a cop
Shoot you and take your vest and your glock, motherfuckers

[Chorus]
What'chu know about stackin G's; you got to come fuck wit me
Puffin on sticky green; you got to come fuck wit me
My team is just oh so clean; you got to come fuck wit me
What'chu know about stackin G's; you gots to come fuck wit me

[JT]
I'm in the streets like the place is mine, told to cover my tracks
I push paper to increase my shine
I'm on my chief, jumpin out the wagon like Tyco
And get the kind of paper that these niggaz'll die fo'
Bossed out, camouflage under my vest B
Motorbike, fast cars, broads and jetskis
Rule #1, keep your eye on your cash flow
Cause rule #2 will get rid of your best so
None of 'em best show, ridin in stress mode
'less they got petrol, pushin that Benz slow
Pick up the Game, let's count some cash
Then we, get to the do', then you put on your mask
On some other shit, ridin wit'cha boy now
We on the West coast, seek and destroy now
It's like when Cal-Berkeley whooped on that Georgetown
We had a riot in the streets fin' to blow now fo'sho' now

[Chorus]

[Verse Three - unknown]
The underboss, ill too fast
Buildin my stocks off the blocks and the wears will sag
Not Gil but tryin to top, the nerd Bill Gates
From the city of project buildings and them mossberg K's
San Francisco, West coast, Northern Bay, California
Man it's Get Low so best to toast, or torch'll spray on ya
Uhh, makin mafia moves, skate from the cops
Yeah they tried stoppin ya dude
But nah, the ball, it don't stop
A shot callin if I fall then my thoughts gon' flock
Yeah, underboss with Game and Doc Figgaro
Clear {?} and I'm the in-di-vi-dual
Holdin weight, in the dope state
Tokin the 8-8, oh, fold {?}
Watch our bread and our team skyrocket
Visualize I can rip beam on the cash and not 8 guys can't stop it

[Chorus]


[Young Menace + (The Game)]
Yeah!  What is it?  It's Young Menace, and the Game
(Hahaha, yeah) Stackin chips, G-Unit (Chuck Taylor)
Doublin down on who? (Compton's young guns)
Sacramenton's finest (Who fuckin with me?)
From Sac-Town to Compton, you dig?

[The Game]
Yo, yo, now ain't no tellin what the Game'll do, listen dawg
I blow the guts out the dutch and do the same to you
And just to get shit crackin, I drop the toaster
Grab the Louis go Sammy Sosa
And you ain't gotta know me to know that, I hop out a new pink Rolls
With the fifty-two Pete Rose throwback
Haze in my eyes, listen to Bobby Womack
On the same corner where Eazy-E sold coke at
And dawg I'ma test your education
What do I mean when I say I move more birds than migration?
I'm the nigga that'll smoke the purple, get high as a kite
Down half the Goose then choke your workers
Don't make me put two in your shirt, dawg I put in the work
Then move bags like Doony & Bert
And stuff work in the GMC, cause on my block
I'm the King of Rock like Run-D.M.C., nigga

[Chorus: Young Menace]
I'm a mobster, with a mac-11 chopper
That'll pop ya and put one through ya motherfuckin collar
I'm a mobster, Robin Hood's like Kevin Costner
If ya fuck with my dollars I'll make you swallow my daughters
I'm a mobster, I keep a bitch by my waist
Just in case I gotta draw down to get this big face
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah
I'm a mobster, uh-huh, yeh-yeah

[Young Menace]
Shhhhh.. I got a lot to say
Dawg I gotta get paid that's why I rock the lle'
And chop the lle' to push bricks through your block a day
I'll bring terror to your squad and make you rock away
Don't depend on tomorrow you can get shot today
I'll spit acid on your turf and watch your block decay
Dawg I spit on your grave and fertilize you too
I hit 'em hard with 16 bars, flames and fumes
Somebody needs to push your infant rap back in the womb
Go 'head and keep talkin that shit and get your life consumed
I put a hole in your chest dawg the size of the moon
Yeah you musta been talkin, how'd you get out that soon?
(You fuckin snitch!) I got a chop that'll touch yo' head like Vidal Sassoon
You don't wanna see my platoon, I got gorillas and baboons
That won't hesitate, they gon' do what they have to
When there's beef on the streets it's on for life like tattoos

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
It don't matter what season, it don't matter not a day
I move traffic through the city, plus I keep the right of way
I'm on point like Bibby, I'm the leader of the team mayne
Got the whole city amped just like a Lakers versus Kings game
Everybody's fired up, I drop major packages
I'm never doin bids because my game is so immaculate
A bitch try to snitch, "I Can't Deny It" like Fabolous
Before the evidence gatherin, someone's in an ambulance
Now that'll learn you to keep your big mouth shut
Those with big mouths I got the perfect size nuts
Yeah I do my dirt, but I wash my hands thoroughly
Handle my business first so I can celebrate early
It's business before pleasure my business brings me pleasure
It feels good to be able to shine, in any type of weather
That's why I do what I gotta do so my money's lookin tight
Whether I'm jukin on the block or have bitches hookin lights y'know?

[Chorus]


Sometimes I wonder
Man, how long is it gon' be for my people to come out
Man we strugglin, it's hard sometimes, but
Tomorrow's better than yesterday, uhh

[The Game]
I was, born in the slums, struggled from day one
Ray Charles vision, blinded by the light from the sun
No navigation, no sense of direction, darker complexion
made it hard to live; dad, how you fathered your kids?
Stranded on the highway of life, left us out to die, left us out to dry
Shhhh, I'm still here, my mother's cries
Nigga no father figures make harder niggaz
Through the years, went to war with niggaz from what I saw in the picture
Now your son is bigger, 13, but just like you
Moms said I would grow up and be just like you
From what you did to my sister she disliked you
Sixteen, eleventh grade, look at me just like you
Gunnin for riches, runnin hoppin project fences
Street corners to Arizona, how I earn my digits
And I'm far from finished, gamin 'til my coffee diminish
Why pray for the afterlife when mines just beginnin, huh

[The Game]
Only son by our mother, no brothers, only sisters by this one
Every time I kissed one I missed one, let me explain
Eight years before the game, everything came with pain
Watch the fate of my family slain would never see good times a-gayn
Cursed with pain by a nigga with no shame
My father, that have the same name as his father
My grandfather wouldn't believe, he pulled up our family tree
I can see him rollin over in his coffin
I'm left with often, thoughts of how could you molest your daughter
They say that's ten times worse than manslaughter
Man you oughta, be dead in a grave
But it wasn't my call, so instead you sat in a cage
High-powered, two-hundred and fifty pound, six-five coward
Woulda been dead in an hour
Heard you was scared to take a shower, scared of the yard
Your end is near, you shoulda been scared of God, motherfucker


[The Game]
Huh, niggaz think they got the game sewed, yeah right
I'm air tight, fresh in them Air Nikes
If the Navi outside, I might be there
Black hoodie, black 9, black wifey airs
Rock guns like Caddy trunks, keep a spare
You see the lump under the Iceberg fleece and gear
And when the beef cook, I'ma put the piece to your head
And if you see a white truck that mean yo' sheets is dead
Then I'm goin goin, back back
to the block to dump the bucket and jump in the drop
Niggaz know I'm good with the glock, they call me Chick Hearns
Cause if the game on knot, I'm callin the shots
I'll wear a shiny suit for a minute like I'm The LOX
Then get gangster with a swap meet bag and a Jordan box
And when I die, bury me with the glock, and a bucket of shells
In case niggaz want drama in hell

[JT]
Yeah, so when Compton niggaz and Fillmoe niggaz get together
Shit happens mayne; real talk from ya nigga Fig'
Doin it big and don't wanna split yo' wig

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'll give you anything you ask fo' - money over bitches
Tell me what'chu blast fo' - fuck around with snitches
What you had to smash fo' - niggaz tried to play me man
(1) Anything you ask fo' - all about this Bay game
(2) Anything you ask fo' - representin Bay game

[JT]
I be the boy with the most cabbage, pluck strings like I'm Lenny Kravitz
I'm in the streets where they goin savage
One, two, we dance on the rooftop
Let the Coupe ghostride then we come to two stops
Figga eight'n by the corner sto'
Niggarali from killer Cali you gotta let 'em know
Yeahh, ya hit me on my Sidekick
Inventory pilin up, niggaz tryin to buy shit
They got me diggin in my files
Pro Tools, ADAT tapes and big sounds
Jumpin on a plane, jumpin out a taxi cab
Stackin up this fettucini now these niggaz hella mad
"Fuck that nigga!  He got another album on the board?"
Damn right, another album on the board
Fuck the bullshit, the Figgarali don't play
I represent the whole Bay every motherfuckin day

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Count rubber band grands
I'm out big on the under, with my fam bam
And I, hover the lands
To expand, I'm from the gutter grime and the sand
No jams the flam's all busted
The dames want the bucks when, they see you stuffed in
your pockets, 'til they get them some
But testin my pocket, only gets you none
Cause I, got a pimp mentality
The scrubs wanna eat shrimp, and get my salary
They ain't knowin I'm tight laced in my shoestrings
Hate the way I'm flowin on the mic, cause I do gleam
All types of baguettes and bezels
We shine like life's {?} rebels
2005, me and my crew just pile the pots
Move like the ice loose, pimp these thangs to watch

[Chorus]


[20 seconds of instrumental to open]

[The Game]
You can catch five, or catch me in the CL-5
Whatever way dog, the Game get live
Keepin it gangsta in a P.D. fitted velour
Late night I'm in Dublin's and I got myself a four
The hood love me, hoodrats gotta hug me
Pop ex, spark the buba, the shit get ugly
Rock the mic anywhere, and I ain't talkin 'bout a concert dog
Talkin 'bout ten niggaz in converts dog
Get it crackin like we out in the yard, and the warden's watchin
Only difference is the whores is watchin
Still love to see a nigga, roll up on 20's
Hop in that six-four, roll up on Bentley's like
I'm a gangsta bay-bee from the C-P-T
Run with the +Pound+ like I'm from DPG
If it's beef, you C-Murder like it ain't No Limit
And I represent the P like Russell Simmons

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I'm a neighborhood superstar, get it, right
Got it? Good, okay
It's the Black Sox and Get Low we get dough
In the Yay they pimp hoes, in Compton we six-fo'

[The Game]
I'm a shining star
And I gotta hit the boulevard in that new Jaguar
Why he move through traffic like that, purple haze
Ralways, the Ojays, the gangsta lean so
Please believe that I keep two G's in my jeans
Two gats in my sleeve, two rats in my Beam'
X-5, mami let's ride
Weave in and out of traffic from Compton to Bed-Stuy
It's the kid from the far West I, oh, shit
He know how to do more than flip pies
Get money like them stick up guys
Them "Ocean 11" licks got the young kid rich for life
And I talkin 'bout a movie or George Clooney
I'm talkin 'bout, runnin in your spots with uzis tucked in the Coogi
Dude me? Naw truly, might lose your lives
They say I've, got 2K2 covered like A.I.

[Chorus]

[JT]
I know ya, love to watch me, 'specially when I'm lookin rocky
The trey with the broccoli with my handles on the Kawasaki
Handle my jewels with the cuff in my shoes
AD jacket on my elbow, 50 coast the jewels
In my neighborhood I'm Young Bill Gates, never shuffle the cake
So cover my face, and run up in the place
I'm a superstar, dick and my chain, glass bezel and bang
80 karats on my pinky and rang
Crews buzz when you speakin my name, cause I'm deep in the game
With top cool thangs and million dollar planes
I'm a maniac, young boy gone, like a young Roy Jones
You ought of my zone and ain't nobody home
In my neighborhood, produce stars, stakes is high
Now we soarin through the spacious skies
Drop yo' body with them cakes and ride, the handle is up
Switchin gears with the pedal and ride

[Chorus]


Yeah, big spit, it's that Bay Area game, Sean T beats
We feedin the underground with this Yay Area tycoon shit
For my nigga JT Fig', y'all know where it come from
Never forget it, that Bay Area shit mayne
Y'knahmtalkinbout? Yeah!
Game, spit that shit

[The Game]
Hey yo the kid still at it, woke up from that coma
Seen hell came back and here comes my first classic
Still chop it up at the table, still put dope in the bag
and still got dope, under the mattress
It was hustle before rappin, nuttin before that and
12 years old, a lost soul, bumpin "Illmatic"
Gunshots tried and almost took the young kid's live
Can't do it I been through it the young kid survived
Got the ghetto on my shoulder homey, it's gon' be a long ride
Bear with me, I'ma take you there with me
Show you how the sun shine in one rhyme, no more stormy weather
Streets is mine, we gon' live forever
Get it together 'Pac is watchin, Big is listenin
Eazy is talkin to us, Big Pun is witnessin
While they souls still glistenin in ghettos from Compton to Brooklyn
the shells cry, every hood's anthem
Where everybody goes to church and prayers are never answered
And they throwin us curveballs but we Hank Aarons
A picture with no canvas, streets are so skanless
Young'uns jump rope, play ball with fiends and dope handlers
Teenage mothers, deadbeat fathers, no families
Lost and often runaway or live with grandparents
Life stories with no authors, see it through, {?} Robinson's cubicles
When time life is so beautiful
Walk with me we can make it if we try, lost soldiers sometimes
We gotta die but it's okay to cry
Mothers strugglin tryin to survive, reach out grab my hand
I got'cha, won't let you go for nuttin, I promise
Praises due to Elijah Muhammad, peace be unto Farad Muhammad
Words of Minister Farrakhan
Been true, be loyal, know your roots, water your soil
Stop fightin amongst ourself from birth we royal
Who's king we fightin over a crown, while lifeguards
watch the hopes and dreams of kids and young teens drown
More infants bein born with AIDS, more parents mournin graves
The plot thickens, somebody show us the way
Tears crackin the pavement, streets breakin up
The thrill is gone and it's a long walk home
So we might as well start runnin, if it's there gotta take it
'Member Jada said "We Gon' Make It"
And it shouldn't take 9/11 to bring our minds together
Shit rough we'll grind together
Light a candle we can shine forever or I can pass
So I won't miss Aaliyah's concert in heaven
Live life while we listen to my old heads
So I glow like the memory of Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez
Through a six-seven Brougham, ride with me through the hood mayne
Where street lights flicker and Chuck Taylors hang
And nobody know they neighbor's name 'less they sell weed or cocaine
A lot of black clouds on a block but no rain
And Game got a lot to say, so they wanna take me down
in my own front yard like Marvin Gaye
Can't do it by myself, people need help
Keep on tryin to live healthy 'til the end of my days
And when I die won't lead my daughter astray, lookin from heaven
Watch my people drive my coffin through the Compton parade

[Verse Two]
I'm in the city where it's strange where killers follow direction
And trail witness protection to get a shot at they brain
Where the babies carry semis and swallow pills for power
Count paper for polly'n, penny-pinch for hours
Take sacks from cowards when the streets is watchin
Tuck guns in trunks cause real G's is boxin
Ain't no other options if you stand on your own two
And if you came to battle you can stand in the phone booth
Cause we don't wear capes in this part of the land
Cause every youngster from my block has been a part of the plan
I've been trainin since eighty-seven and famous since eighty-nine
Teaching came from the Nation, my spirit is from divine
When I, pass the word through these raps on beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, when I pass these beats
It's fo'sho' that the Lord gon' make the whole track speak
To the streets, y'knahmtalkinbout people?
Make the track speak, "Truth Rap," get it right
"Truth Rap" mayne, for the people, get it right, "Truth Rap"


[22 second instrumental to open]

[The Game]
Open your eyes, we in a new era
Less drama more unity, everything's lookin a lil' clearer
Like a face in the mirror karma
It was right before our eyes, facin the future I cried
No more Martin Luther shots, from off the words from Malcolm
Tunes from Jimi, it's sad but you gotta hear me
All praises due to the mighty Allah, God forgive me
I've been through it, but it's not all bad in me
A young kid tryin to change his ways
Every day a lil' closer, show him the light let him pave the way
Gotta see my grave someday, no more cheddar, some pictures
Grandma I'm comin to spend forever wit'cha, I miss ya
No more Sunday dinners, wish you could see your grandson now
Got bigger, all grown now
Got a daughter think she grown now, just started walkin
Just started talkin, she can potty on her own now
Life is good, memories are better
We all gotta go, I know it's cold grab a sweater
We can take that ride together, cry whatever, die whatever
Walk through the sky together, huh


Yeah...
Yeah man we them niggaz everybody talkin 'bout
Hey yo, yo

[Verse One]
Whether it's, chips or whips or bricks of 'caine
I still shine at the end when y'all forced to rain
Changed the game, three shots parade ya Range
Hit the passenger, driver, old man on a cane
I'm a shell in the chamber, waitin to pop
Like Stoudamire on the court I'm used to movin the rock
Cruise in the drop, 740, snub in the box
My attitude shifty, never callin the cops
A Green Bay jersey, out on Bennett puffin hershey
D's on the route tryin to catch a nigga dirty
Respect the flow, better yet respect the dough
He get respect like rich and po'
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'd rather wake up and spit bars
And your wife, known to make my dick hard
Cartier lenses, 22's on my Benz's
When shit break out, y'all hit the fences

[Chorus]
We stay bent, laid back behind tint, puffin sticks, spliff up
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
Big belt, flossy shades, paint on glaze, nigga
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
Unidentifiable straps makin heat clap sicker
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about
We about reliable scratch and gettin this math quicker
We are the hustlers everyone's talkin about

[Verse Two]
Shit I might as well be duels, cause they call me the Flowmaster
I keep ridin tracks like a natural disaster
You know I'm 'bout macra{?} I'll clap ya, a pirate like {?}
Far from a Hollywood actor
A factor, focused on paper and cars
I move like crowds, stay minglin with the stars
I'm in the 6500 Benz truck with some broads
Dimes in every state I strike through be on me so hard
You know them Bentley bound, {?} down, wild Hummer chicks
That wanna take the car, cover up your tight summer shit
The game's heavy, man that's way off the charts
Heavier than killer whales at animal theme parks
You niggaz is SweeTarts, my family is street sharks
We keep the ER busy tryin to revive the treat marks
Shit, we merk niggaz like Eddie, get ready
We got heat that set car alarms off like M-80's

[Chorus]

[The Game]
The Game on some regular rhymin, fuck all this new shit
When they gon' let real niggaz get on that cruise ship
Black Sox and Dallas Squad got, chains and cars
Get, brains from stars after those awards
Miyagi's or doubles, don't think I won't buy out the bar
That's little shit, Mercedes dealership, buy out the cars
Sticker in the window, let 'em know that it's ours
Sittin on shit you ain't never seen like we got it from Mars
Game like Laker Will, snatch a bitch off your arm
She see Game covered in ice like I lived through a snowstorm
Plus I blow digits like my first name was {?}
Pay off security at clubs, get our guns admitted
Outside the club in the parkin lot, four dot six
Not know it's stocked?  Nigga it's the one we keep the bricks in
Hard black on black leather's what we keep the chicks in
And bitches stay sniffin like smellin dubs is a sixth sense

[Chorus]


Ay who got all these niggas walking around
With all this motherfuckin' air in they chest?
Oh, you pumpin' your motherfucking self up, huh?

You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit

Pull up, park the Camaro like an arrow
Only fuck with Snoop, nigga fuck your cousin Harold
Plus I got the barrel on tuck, nigga what
First nigga jump up, first nigga fucked up
I'm with the bullshit, Jimmy Butler in the cutlass
Hop out, get yo ass beaten, no mustard
Hood full of killers, Cedar Block, no busters
Say we gon' do it, but we ain't, don't trust us
Get your ass robbed out here
By a nigga name Rob out here with no job out here
We with the bullshit, Burgundy sob out here
Get smoked if ever say slob out here
Nigga this Piru, I'm advertising like a commercial
Hand me your hood pass, pat you down then murk you
Nigga we still mad Doughboy killed Virgil
Blood this ain't no motherfuckin' movie

You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit

40 days, 40 nights
If I ever lose a muthafuckin' fight
You in the pen', say good night
Get your ass strangled with the motherfuckin' kite
I am with the bullshit, save them motherfuckin' tears
You bunk down with the nigga that ain't had pussy in years
He with the bullshit, fuck you gon' go?
Nigga where the fuck you gon' go when he made you his hoe
Now you switchin' in the pen
Through the glass talking to your mama, bitchin in the pen'
Ohh you snitchin' in the pen?
Your lawyer stuck you on the pen', nigga just stick you in the pen' (ohh)
My nigga Reek doing 30
And I got gun that he did murder with, it's still dirty
And I heard from a little birdy, niggas wanna problems
Jump in my Impala, skrrt!

You know I'm with the bullshit, ay
You know I'm with the bullshit
Niggas know I'm with the bullshit
You know I'm with the bullshit

I was just a young nigga on the block
Just a young nigga on the block
Said I was just a young nigga on the block
Just another young nigga on the block
Suge signed Pac, it was good cause I fuck with Dre
Straight out of Compton was a product of N.W.A
But shit everything change when Ice Cube went solo
Riding shotgun in my brother Fase Lolo
On my way to school, having shoot outs with the cholos
If it wasn't them, we getting jacked by the popo
In the tenth grade smoking weed on the low though
My momma ain't know though back of the class
With a Source magazine just flipping through the photos
Fuck with Reasonable Doubt but not when Pac was on the road though
In 1995 I started to bang
And I would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

Even though he was born on the East, Pac was accepted here
Especially rocking that chain with that electric chair
I set back and watched him, threw up the West side
As Suge, Pac, Snoop and Dre hit the cover of the Vibe
'96, it was on
I took a Death Row sticker then slapped it on the chrome
Riding down Rosecrans with my hand on the toast
Stuck at a light, bumping "2 of Amerikaz Most"
I used to spray it on a locker, a nigga run up
I yell, "Death Row!" and sock him and I kept a gun tucked
Selling weed with my nigga Sonic
All we used to listen to was Doggystyle, All Eyez on Me and The Chronic
Then a couple Long Beach niggas changed the game
Daz and Kurupt, nigga, fuck O-Dog and Caine
But when Dr. Dre left, shit wasn't the same
And I would've did anything for that nigga Death Row chain

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains

Dre started Aftermath and found Em
Eazy-E died from AIDS but why him?
Snoop signed to P, Suge signed Left Eye
Death Row fell apart, what happened to the West side?
I used to smoke and just sit in the truck
I was forced to bang Biggie and Puff
I was mad at niggas, felt Death Row ain't give us enough
And for that we ain't giving a fuck
The whole coast split it up, now Dre in New York working with Nas
And Pac stomping niggas out inside the mirage
I saw it on the news and I knew it was on
They say the look on Pac face, nigga knew he was wrong
Knew he was gone, stomp the nigga two minutes long
Know I'm repping West side, putting you in the song, damn
2Pac got smoked by Baby Lane
And both of them niggas dead over a fucking Death Row chain

A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains
A nigga would do anything for one of them Death Row chains


[MICAH:]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

[The Game:]
Lil Frogg, nigga, I miss you
Your momma still wish she could kiss you
I talked to all the homies, yeah, all the homies
Swear that day we wish that we was with you
I remember when I first rolled up
Seen you laid out there on Rosecrans
It was Cedar Block and if you read about us
We was throwing that shit up with both hands
Make me wanna hop back in that old van
Take an Olde E and sip the whole can
But I'm out here, with your brother and your pops
All night, my nigga, I ain't got no plans
Your mom's out here having a fit
Big Frogg and the truck niggas sick
All the homies on the block getting lit
Putting everything they can into a clip
Yeah, to the street, it wasn't even Crips
Some of the homies trying to blame a bitch
Cause he was riding on sky today, he died
Wrong place, wrong time, nigga fucked up shit
But your funeral ain't nothing but love
Look around, it ain't nothing but Bloods
And let me tell you what a bitch nigga did
Took a good daddy away from seven kids

[MICAH:]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I

[Payso:]
Still riding around through the city looking for an enemy
Still riding around through the city thinkin' 'bout all the memories
Thinking back like God damn
All them niggas really really livin me
Wishing I knew what I knew now
Half them niggas wouldn't have been next to me
Nowadays, ain't too many niggas next to me
None of these bitches getting next me
I seen what it did to a good friend
That was God trying to lecture me
That was God trying open me
That's when God got close to me
I went through the fire, went through the pain
Now it's all hope for me
Now it's designer, in the ghost that they chauffeur me
My haters is mad, oh you know, they didn't go for me
They wish I was gone, they wish in the song somebody wrote for me
But I got the GOAT in me, I got the truth in me

[MICAH:]
Said I wake up in the morning
Spark one for the homies, they dead and gone, but I
But I'm never ever lonely
To your memory, my nigga, to your memory, my nigga
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
They dead and gone, but I


When the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up

Dear God, I now know what I've done
Through my thoughts and my actions
And the things that I've said
Sometimes by mistake and sometimes on purpose, Amen
Got my mind on this murder, and promise so ganged up
Got a black Mac 11 and it hit like a Mac truck
Product of bad luck, play it out on that movie screen
And to scope with some killers, almost die for moving green
My mama a fella, my daddy so long gone
My grandmama died at 18, left me all alone
All I got is my guns, bandanas and weed
Leave me with 2 dead brothers, my enemies gon' bleed
I'm messed up, suicidal, rest in peace to Hayes
Wasn't no killers where my niggas seen some better days
That California have you stressed out, a million ways to die
Gotta pull that vest out

Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up

Fuck niggas gon' die, speaking homicide
Laid out in the street, let his mama cry
White chalk, black streets
Red rack, coke killer, watch 'em leak
Black on black crimes
Killing our own brothers
But what the fuck can we do
When you got on the wrong colours?
Take a breath, inhale, let it go, lights off
Have a problem, hit the switch, lay it low
Soon as you walk out the crib, we gon' blast
Hit the 110 and now the one time on your ass
In 4 minutes, you thought that you got away with it
Thought that shit was a dream, let us pray

Cause when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up
So many of my niggas died
Better watch what you throw up
Niggas talking all that shit
But when the gang sings go up
You see your life flash right before your eyes
And you know what
That's how it is on the west side
When the gang sings go up


40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupÃ©s, coupÃ©s
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty

I am from where the niggas say "What'd up Cuh?"
You can get your ass wet up by "One Blood?"
And I bet they just saw El Chapo
And you can get your noodles spilled right up in your taco
And you can get your taco turnt into some nachos
All over cheese my nigga
What's beef my nigga? Ridin' by slow mo
Bullet holes in Caine and Sharif my nigga!
Fuck peace my nigga! Cause every time we try that
We get smoked by police my nigga
I am bringing sheets my nigga
Went from being skinny and gettin' jacked for my Penny's to a beast my nigga

40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupÃ©s, coupÃ©s
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty

I want the zooms zooms and wam wams, bricks in the Trans Am
Shooters on first, second and third, that's a grand slam
These rap niggas Fruit Loops; Toucan Sam
When I say so, bloods rush like a handstand
And ain't with that old Death Row shit
Been bangin' since '94, I ain't never did no hoe shit
Type of nigga I am, empty out the whole clip
Call my YG's and have em' run through your whole shit
Who was before Kendrick, who was before Nip?
Middle of the Slauson, did my shit fighting four Crips
You win some and you lose some nigga
You break knuckles and you bruise some nigga, what?

40 ounces ain't the only thing poppin'
'Round here we get it clockin' when the things start knockin'
Low lows ain't the only thing droppin'
Bodies hit the ground, tires screeching niggas yell "Compton!"
Like ooh, ooh
Them niggas hoppin' out of coupÃ©s, coupÃ©s
Fuck you thought nigga? They tryna' overuse the shotty
Shit I'm tryna' hit the news with the shotty


7:46, wake up, hand on my dick
Lakers lost by 30 last night, I'm talking shit
Roll up a Backwood, killer in my spliff
Reading GQ magazine while I take a shit
Walk back to my room, wake up this bitch
Kickin' her out, dick in her mouth, that Compton shit, boy
I'm on that monster shit, boy
Chopper out the trunk, on some Compton shit, boy
I remember flipping dimes and shit
Putting five to them planes, that La Bamba shit
Dr. Dre ain't got time for this, he wearing Beats
I got my ear to the ground, lil' nigga, I'm in these streets like
Streetlights and lead pipes, up in the projects
We gon' make it out but this shit is a slow process
Lean right, keep heat tight, don't ever digest
Hollow tips where your mind rest, you forgot

They don't make niggas like me
Nah, they don't make niggas like me
They don't make niggas like me
They don't make niggas like me
Wassup

I'm that nigga that sold packs by the bungalows
Animal out here, my niggas in the jungles know
I'm cold like one below in Green Bay
Had the water on the block, to the fiends I was a stingray
I had a Z before I seen Jay
I had the West, I used to sling yay
But sometimes when tables turn like a DJ
Had them rocks and them bands like Green Day
I used to listen to, Project Pat tote straps and sell crack
Used to smoke that Bobby Brown, fuck rats and sit back
On my forte, was more yay, my enemies got gift-wrapped
The two nicks in two days, got new fits and new Js
Thankful for my two Ks, my vision clear as Blu-ray
Kill your ass today, knock the glue off your toupÃ©e
My guns like "hi", leave that shy shit to Lupe
Then chop the top off the coupe, doomsday

They don't make niggas like me
Nah, they don't make niggas like me
They don't make niggas like me
They don't make niggas like me
Cook crack nigga

Aye man, just tell God come and lift me
Come and talk to the devil, man this nigga stay busy
Don't ever get it twisted, just cause we don't wear Dickies
You ain't heard of Mausberg, you know you ain't from the city
Man, I was born in this problem
We thought we knew the answer way before we seen options
Do you know the feeling to have niggas out watching
With your kid out shopping, you gon' still yell "Bompton!"?
Man, I done lost hope
Hope you a Thug to the Bone when we Cross Roads
Too many RIP shirts around your turf, wait
We trying to figure why ya'll got mid in the first place
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, know my niggas on the wait
Wait, wait, wait, know somebody finna pay

Tam's Burger on the corner, slip up and get your issue
Drum fully loaded, probably catch 'em walking
Die for your name, get a blue or a cherry coffin
Pray for the homie moms, why she had to lose her son
We gon' make 'em pay the price for what they done
Organized crime, go on a mission weekly
187, man-down completely
Grew up off food stamps and swim through blood baths
Sheriffs hop out, point guns, searching your nutsacks
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
That's what Crips call it, but 'round here this Bompton
I ain't politicking, I ain't sneaking dissing
I'm really for my section, creeping up Wilmington
With my locs concealing weapons
Fucked with K. Dot back when he had the waves
And been supporting games since the Aftermath chain
Support Compton

It started in Martin Luther King
Pocket of the Crip
Before I knew anything
Married to the block
Pinkie ring for my wedding ring
Yeah we right here on Nord Street
The hood core street
I be in the hood, you ain't gotta force me
And I just thank God my momma didn't abort me
Cause she was only fourteen
But that's a different story
Whole family's running frutas and they support me
The Pirus support me, the Crips support me
Your bitch support me, hit a lick just to support those that was for me
My nigga Frogg was for me, D-Rock was for me
Niggas phony but I know my niggas watching for me
Cause I done had some close cases
Wrong time, right places
My life, I ain't finna let 'em take it
My mind, I ain't finna let 'em take it
From El Segundo to Rosecrans
They know who run the program

[Game:]
I grew up off of Wilmington and Rosecrans
Where nigga's drink 4-0 cans and throw it up with both hands
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
I'm from where them niggas in the trenches
Sit back, get they hair braided and analyze Kendrick
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
Support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga
I kick it where niggas do drive-bys all day
And bought a pair of Beats just because they fuck with Dre
We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton
We support Compton, support Compton, support Compton nigga

They be like "Dre ain't from Compton
Cube ain't from Compton"
You niggas dumb
I be the type nigga to ask them niggas asking where they from
Yeah I be trippin', de-boning niggas
Cruising through the hood like fuck you
C-lo them niggas
'64 in my garage, only drop the top on Saturday
Reminiscing to 96 when I was running through a rat a day
Compton High with the A.I braids
Over the Summer came with Junior Seau waves
Compton ain't shit, get a nigga fucked up and jumped
Race riots with the ese's but that ain't what you want
Red and blue bandanas knotted at the front
Welcome to the home of the pistol grip pump
Compton


[The Game:]
I left the impala astray, one blunt in my ashtray
And you can go ask Dre, see what he got to say
About the Chronic, the Chronic
We get money the fast way, give bitches the gassed face
Don't wait 'til the last day, to see who got the deals
On the Chronic, the Chronic

[AV:]
Compton, California born and raised nigga
Remember all them days nigga
Chillin' with the homies, shooting dice, catch a faze nigga
Little niggas out here on this corner gettin' fade nigga
Did some shit, but we gon' take these secrets to the grave with us
I did it all nigga, run it from the law nigga
Life behind the bars nigga, and make collect calls nigga
Selling dope and gang banging, I was tryna ball nigga
Everybody come up, and nobody wanna fall with us
Every night I had a dream I made it outta hood
They see these lights and these cameras and think we got it good
You either gang bang, rap or sell drugs nigga
Welcome to the hub nigga, it's Compton

[The Game:]
I left the impala astray, one blunt in my ashtray
And you can go ask Dre, see what he got to say
About the Chronic, the Chronic
We get money the fast way, give bitches the gassed face
Don't wait 'til the last day, to see who got the deals
On the Chronic, the Chronic

[AD:]
Compton, California since I was a youngin'
Crowd banging through the speakers, reminiscin 'bout them old days
Grinding hard, on the come up, tryna get it
When we ran into Xzibit  now a young nigga know Dre
No Game, no K. Dot
Hard love, I ain't even gotta name drop
Like I got an addiction, because I can't stop
Every time I hear a record when the base drop, bang
Wack, you shouldnât have never gave me this beat
Stat, you should have never gave me this beat!
I'm a Comp-town Crip, I'm goin' crazy in these streets
One time for my roots goin' brazy in these streets on the hood
Yeah, yeah, better heard me in the club, niggas think that I lost it
Ballin hard on these records, my triangle office
You can ask Battlecat
Who the youngin that be coming to the ref school?
Pharmacy
One of the best spittin on the hood, you can ask Pooh
Just left loose compound
Cuz I'm hanging on the Westside, don't get knocked down
It's cool, I don't do it for the props now
Need help, I just call up the Doc now

[The Game:]
I left the impala astray, one blunt in my ashtray

[The Game & (Problem):]
Problem struck a match and the match went out
Car pool full of hoes (Diamond Lane in the house)
You know I be lovin' them, fuckin them, fuck all the kissing and hugging
I'm thugging nigga, it's The Game in the house
Baby girl with the dominos, set up the table for the homie

[The Game:]

Girl you need a thug in your life, you need a thug in your life

[The Game & (Problem):]

Fuckin' bling on you baby, you bad girl

Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
And on that note, my nigga Game where you at

(In a bathroom nigga, bout' to break a bitch back)
Ooh-wee, I wish I was you

Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life
Girl you need a thug in your life, thug in your life

Girl you need a thug in your life, you need a thug in your life


(People trying)

(To find a way out)
[Game:] Oh, yeah! That was me in 2004
(Love ain't around)
[Game:] Ain't never been around 
(Look at California)
[DJ Skee:] Just like we back again
[Game:] Yeah
[Skee:] Fresh of that Purp & Patron
[Game:] That's right
[Skee:] This is The Hangover
[Game:] Every time you look at me...
[Skee:] And I just landed back in. Live from LA
[Game:] ...You look at California 
[Skee:] I'm the world famous DJ Skee
[Game:] I am the Westside 
[Skee:] I told you I'm only dropping classics
Reppin' that Westcoast. Yo Game, I don't think they ready

Palm trees, beautiful women
Drop top phantom now this is living
Started off chopping crack in my grandma kitchen
But y'all know that, so letâs get down to bidness
Outta towners beware, of what you wear
"Yo son, I'm from New York," but we donât care
The Crips, the Bloods, the EsÃ©'s. The daytons, the dogs, the chevys 
What you know about Cali and everything I rate
Nigga I make the dinner you be sure to scrape the plate
From Compton's Most to N.W.A
From Snoop Dogg Dr. Dre, niggas love us
What about the bitches? You mean these bitches bouncing in my back seat while my Impala hit switches?
They riding with the king, a California king
If it ainât about that it ainât 'bout a motherfucking thing
I'm living the American Dream
Sitting fat but I donât sing 
I don't fuck wit rats if you know what I mean
You thinking 50 but I am talking Christina Milian
Sucked a million dicks but still ain't sold a million 
Bitch trying to get a ride like a Milian
I know you like, "What this gotta do in LA?"
Bitch tried to fuck me and she almost fucked Dre so... 

Yeah, slow this shit down man
I'ma let California fuck you now
Thatâs right
Yeah, how it feel?
Y'know California niggas
Got big dicks, big trucks, big mouths, big guns
Weâll fuck you all night

Straight RnB
Black Wall Street Records we donât play no games
I mean after 4 hours weâll fuck you off on a nigga
I got the houses; here, Miami 
Condo in New York, condo in Wilshire
I done lived in Beverly Hills
Look down the street at Range Rovers, Bentleys and Phantoms passing by
As the wind blows through my motherfucking, fades
Niggas know what it is wit me nigga
California king and thatâs for life
Donât give a fuck what a nigga say

Let me introduce ya, to something you not used to
I'm Californiaâs future 
Sit back watch what I do to
These Dre beats, these Timbaland tracks
I just blazed and my spit crack
I Scott Storch em we canât afford em
Every hot producer seen Game record
My flow outta this word, like Neptunes
California was dying, I came to the rescue
First time Snoop Dogg ever heard me spit 
His reply was like, "Damn, nephew"
That was '05
And I was so eleven, four hours, six years I'm ahead of my time
I let you niggas be LeBron
Even he can't see Kobe in his prime
Picture Kobe in Lebrons 
That's too much game I'm outta my mind
And that's a hot line 
I think niggas wanna hear me say that one more time
Picture Kobe in Lebrons 
That's too much game I'm outta my mind
Outta my soul
Been having outta body experiences since I was 7 years old
Look at California he ain't scared
Shot a deuce five 'fore he had Nike Airs
My pops like, "There go the block" 
I'm like, "Where?"
Brass knuckles in my Levi's never fight fair
20 years later I'm right here
Red rag wiping off all white Airs
Let a nigga step on em. I'ma go Wycleff on him
Could go Raekwon the Chef on him
Throwing up a dub, bangin' Wu-Tang
Riding with a chopper like a young Hussein
In a new Range
Fuck wit the Crips but I'm from the P.I.R.U gang
Momma I did it. You told me to so I spit it
I don't just talk Cali I live it
From Aftermath to sit wit it I'm sick wit it
So nigga admit it
You'll never be Game
Never be Pac, never be Doggy Dogg
I donât know why you spit cos nigga you ainât shit
You writing for Detox? Nigga suck my dick
Me and Hittman, did that before
First mailman left then I seen the trap door
Came in from the back
Nobody could stop him
Not EVE, Busta Rhymes or Rakeem
And Bust my nigga, so I would never diss him
Fuck over any other rapper with Henny in my system
Who want it? Not Jigga
I'm treacherous like trigger
I'm Naughty by Nature nigga with more priors than Richard 
And I can say whatever cos I made Jimmy Iovine richer
And he get richer every time I call you a bitch ass nigga
Let Chris Bosh run up on Kobe again
I'ma catch him in the club and open his chin
Cos I ride or die for this Cali shit 
Break a nigga off proper like a valley bitch
I chop a nigga down like a brick of raw 
I'm notorious like Biggy Smalls
I know he from New York but he like me 
Last thing I wanna do 'fore I D.I.E. is
Look at, look at, look at California [repeats]...

I know New York the mecca of hip hop
A-town stay doing their thing
Chi-town breed Kanye and motherfucking Common
Sometimes y'all gotta look at California 
Ay yo Jimmy Iovine, tell Dre these headphones the shit


[Hook - Timbaland:]
We keep it hot like Miami, raise the motherfucker roof in here
We burn it up like Cali, and we shinning like some chandeliers
Hey, and get familiar, my house, get familiar, my car, get familiar, my watch
Get familiar, my bro, get familiar, my house, get familiar, my car
Get familiar, my name, get familiar now

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
See Timb, match the black on black, white phantom, white dogs, that's crack on crack
I got a plan make you rain ten stacks, for the whole patron bottle, where the sheep through back
I got the niggers jumping (I got the bitches moving)
I got the black Thompson (I seen the baby do it)
I keep a 45 up in my rollies in the sky
Cause I be on a load, except for when I fly
I'm always drinking son, riding around toys
And I stay blazing like Brandon Roy
I make it rain boy like I'm Lil Wayne boy
And Timbaland my flamethrower so...

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
Who want it with Game? (Who want it with me?)
Who want it with them? (Who wanted this beat?)
I got a Bently, I gotta fixate
I got a Rolls phantom they walk like a great thing
Some niggas take shorts, so I gotta bust back
You know how this shit goes, so nigga walk back
I gotta wolfpack
And they off criss, so nigga don't start and it won't be said
They done gettin' poppin', I gotta stay it love, I got a poppin' taste, I got it poppin' hoes
I got the sickest chain on me and you can see it glow
I'm hitting mothers and daughters between those

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - (Timbaland) + The Game:]
(Man homie) you stepped on my Air Force ones
(No takers likely), is that your chick?
(Hey baby), we gonna take a shot of this patron
(I heard your mic is like me) The unit she fighting
She popping one every one [?]
I don't want her in the fam, she can follow me home
I don't hear no talking baby, I'm off on this patron
I'mma bring her back down from whatever planet she's on
Timbaland gave me mad props
Get more head then laptops
You niggas said you bought it, but I don't see a mascot
My Lambo's got stash spots
So don't make the dash prop
You all wanting but fuck what you saying...

[Hook]


[The Game:]
Nigga, I'm from Compton
I don't need no mothafuckin' pass, no stamp, no nothin'
I don't need a passport to come through the mothafuckin' 'hood, nigga
I got a gun and a Bentley, what

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Yeah, throw on my Levi's, throw on my hoodie
Tie up my Jordan's I'm ready for whatever
Hit the block like Bush, but I ain't no Saint
I'm just a 'hood nigga who taught himself how to paint
Pictures mothafucka
I'll show you how I went from rags to riches mothafucka
Welcome to the block life, niggas on the block like
The boy Hov can't tell me shit about the Roc life
I started with powder, turned into hard rock
Call it a cafe when the fiends here all block
We was just hustlin', listenin' to Scarface
Throwin' back tall cans, lookin' out for marked vans
I used to do it for my mother
Change the diapers on my sisters, clean the Pumas for my brothers, mothafucka
If that's not 'hood, send a shot to my dome
Wipe the wheels on the Bentley, nigga and tell the 'hood I'm comin' home

[Hook:]
I'm home, you know what it is
Ready for the biz and I gotta do it big
I'm home, how many times are you alive if you ran these streets
So many times the streets kept calling me

[Verse 2 - The Game:]
I used to hit the block like a bat out of hell
With a blunt in my mouth and a pocket full of shells
Somebody shot my older brother, give a fuck about a jail
Give a fuck who outside, I don't care who tell
It was like that when we was just boys in the 'hood
Nigger, fuck what you saw on Boyz N the Hood
This is real, feel my pain, feel my gun, grab it
And when we pull up on this corner, let 'em have it
You wanna know how it feel to kill
Then grab my steal and peel at will
Put the ski mask on, hop in the backseat
Show 'em how to turn the block into a trackmeet
Your honor I'm guilty, I'm a felon and I pack heat
Fiends know my name cause Game let the crack speak
If that's not 'hood send a shot to my dome
Wipe the Lamborghini down, nigga and tell the 'hood I'm coming home

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kurupt:]
What you think mo' fucka?
I'll let seventeen go before you blink mo' fucka
I'm a poetry racist
You know it's me instantly just off a couple of phrases
I'm seventeen years and pussy just stopped a bullet
Pull these out of the wooly mammoth hoodie
I'm headed to the house, the land of ram
Runnin' in niggas spots, drop your hands and the grams
Drop everything you got from your pockets to your hands
When I was young we hit licks out of Astro vans
When I was young the Fox Hillmar was alit
Lick with Aquafina flow, Euprovina for pits
Pup, a child to a hog, a cat to a dog
I'm a lion to these frogs, who's supplyin' raw
I'm feeling like Martin Luther King, it seems
And everything I visualized was just a dream
I'm headed home nigga

[Hook]


[Verse 1]
Sometimes I have fucked up dreams
Wake up in cold sweats, canât sleep,
Hit the kitchen for some Moet
I get drunk, but I ainât never smoke no wet
Been on tour 3 months and I ain't had no sex
Been meditating, exercising my mental bowflex
Michael Jackson dead, which one of us âbout to go next
Me, Mary J, Robin Thicke or Britney Spears
Nigga I ainât afraid to die, tell the devil Iâm right here
Hoe, I can take the strings out of these Nike airs
Tie it round the ceiling fan and end it right here
Kick the ladder cause I climbed that twice
Hate it or love it, Iâm one blood nigga, itâs my life
And I can die if I want to, and mama you can cry if you want to
Just tell my sons the truth and as the maggots eat away at my flesh
Let this iced out cross, walk through the bones in my chest

[Chorus]
I can try my way (Iâm lost)
I canât find my way (lost)
I canât find my way (Iâm lost)
I canât find my way (lost)
I canât find wayâ¦

[Verse 2]
If I tell the story you gotta keep it between us,
Only other niggas that know are Spliff Star and Buss
I call Buss when I need a shoulder
And I donât always listen so he call me back and say âI told youâ
But anyway, my paps is a Peadophile, how you stick your 28 year old dick in your child
And now how it feel to be 52 and have a son thatâs a millionaire, and he donât fuck with you, daddy!
She was only in the six grade, the day I heard her scream, I should have hit you with the switch blade
Then she ran but I ainât know which way, she ended up in Vegas doing everything her pimp say
Iâve seen her one Christmas with a black guy, I took her to the store and bought her shades with my last five,
My little sister is a prostitute, and Iâma tell you what Iâm about to do.
Go get her cause sheâ¦ (lost)

[Chorus]
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way

[Verse 3]
That's all Iâm thinking on this Grey hound
Usually Iâll be in this seat with brids and a tre pound
But this time I riding for family
Like Khaled did for Ross, they hold it down in Miami
On my way to Michigan, not to see D12
Iâm knocking on every door, âhave you seen this female?â
Hereâs a picture of my pretty baby sister
Here go one when she was ten and this one our last Christmas
Low light skinned girl, long curly black hair, sorry for wasting time,
I know you probably donât care,
Feel like I walk longer than just 8 miles
Ran into a borded up BMF safe house
Made me think about all the time I spent with Meech makinâ it rain in Magic city
When life was a Georgia peach
Now life is a rotton apple
Run faster than New York
You see my sister call me âcause life is too short to get (lost)

[Chorus]
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way
She canât find her way


[Intro] 
Ya'll know what it is.its the purple tape,

Nah nigga its been a day since I hit you with that purple tape! 
Niggas know my style, movin them tracks out 
And "The R.E.D. Album" gunna be worth the wait. 
Nah, nigga the earth gonn shake 
And Rihanna gonn be hopping outta birthday cakes. 
I'mma trim & top it till these little niggas stop it. 
Nigga I'm clocking let your G-shock clock it. 
Just got a Mazzi, took it to the shop, dropped it! 
Slide through the hood, three boss side pocket, 
With my side chick and her hair flip like the old sidekick, 
The world bumping my shit! 

Ohh they think I will make it up here, right [x2]

[Verse 2]
Niggaz like "Game, you did this yesterday?" that's right. 
Matter of fact, to be exact I did it last night. And I can prove it to ya, 
The Heat lost to the Nics in Madison Square, nigga I'm like Google to ya. 
Watch how I do it to ya, I'm the King started my own gang, 
Shit I'm like Harry Hoover to ya. 
Nah, matter of fact, Freddie Krueger to ya. 
This ain't a dream, I'll really put the rougar to ya. 
Scared how that new shit drop, set up shop. 
R.E.D. Album gonna drop, them niggas gonn call cotch, 
Niggas gonna call cops Chuck Taylor in the building 
Can't see the goons, they blend in, like chameleons! 
Rolling Stones said I'm brilliant hottest mixtape since Wayne dropped No Ceilings. 
Now I ride round the hood with no ceilings, 
Everybody in the movies clappin' for the villian!


Red Aston Martin Vanquish
V12 sick
Red cranberry juice in my vodka

[Chorus]
Game so violent, give me a backwood, roll a violet
Blow the smoke out and scream violence
Only thing slowin nigga down is the violin
Yeah The violin, yeah the violin

Game so violent, pass me a dutch, roll the violet
Blow the smoke out and scream violence
Only thing slowin nigga down is the violin
Yeah The violin, yeah the violin

[Verse 1]
I do beef so fuck vegans
niggas see me in vegas
Blowin' Garcia Vegas, gettin' head in the Venetian
Vehicular manslaughter when I'm behind the 'Vette
Voluptious 22s and you ain't seen these yet
Zero to sixty, vomit
This chick ridin with me from Venice
And she out of this world, like a comet
Play with balls like Venus
Head game the meanest
And she used to model for Victoria's secret
So I'm victorious
Word to Notorious
Screamin' out victory, never became a victim see
I'm the vampire, sink this teeth into your bitch neck
Give her VVS stones and keep her fuckin wrist wet
Jimmy Iovine give me big check
Coz I valeted the Valentines Day Massacre
Put it on his desk
Then I vanished, in a red Vanquish
And left interscope bangin Dipset

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Who's the first victim with their blood spilled on the horizon
Come through with more niggas more behind me than Verizon
I'm that villain like Ren was
You see what my pen does
Start a fucking riot with my pen cause
I'm that nigga turn your man into a vegetable
Stripes validated like Clue I'm a professional
Spit on video vixins, still fuck Vida Guerra
Another word and I'm cummin' on your mascara
Let your mouth be the venue for this vendetta
Valet parked this beretta, in your v neck sweater
You know who I'm talkin to
I could vent but that's for mine, I spit venom
Coz half of these rap niggas is vagina
Speakin of vagina, Vidal Sassoon
Your bitch, my room, her head vacuum
And this ain't no verbal assault
We outline enemies in any vicinity

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I heard Jay got the vapours
Don't respond, I rape em
Give em one bar John Clettas, Venezuelan, yeah
Flow sick, top models be the vaccine
Drop top Phantom, bangin' no vaseline
niggas ill, come and burn down they village
Getaway car, Dodge Viper, missin' the ceilin'
See I'm 'bout millions - love fuckin' virgos
In a village somewhere, sippin' on Merlot
Game so vicious, yeah nigga, they know
Broad day, broadway, blow like volcanoes
Eat like Sopranos gold bars and vaults
Word to Funkmaster Flex, there's a vacancy in New York
So I volunteered to be the new king
New car, new ring
Show you how the westside do things
The southside do things
Bring out the choppas
Wear a vest, coz these shots ain't no vodka

[Chorus]


[Intro - Radio Announcer:]
We gonna get into this next jam of the week right here. It's called White Soft Porn. You know what I'm talkin' about. I'm the infamous Turbo [?], you dig? And this is WSP radio, where even if you got sloppy walls, you still gettin' balls in your jaws

[Verse 1 - The Game:]
Walk in the liquor store like where the patrÃ³n, I need a whole case
Throwin' that Britney take out the Ghostface
You know that white girl go both ways
And you know what I mean if you ever sold yay
We can take it from the top like San Jose
Or the bottom of the yacht in St. Tropez
So, pop the rosÃ©, ok, ok
She got a white bronco, call her OJ
She like slow man, she my snow flake
Don't smoke chronic, but she can sniff the whole eighth
Her Columbian. Like Scarface
And we ain't gotta fuck. She all face
She from the valley, somewhere in Cali
My homie Snoop used to fuck with her sister Sally
I pulled over in the alley
She shift my gears and whispered in my ear

[Hook - Mars:]
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn

[Verse 2 - Asher Roth:]
Yea, Ay, Uh
Don't be intimidated
When I put it on you, baby, you be liberated
Ay, We gettin' innovative
This new position that I'm thinkin', let me demonstrate it
Ay, Ain't gotta fornicate
And your performance is important when you use your face
Ay, She never used to be this way
She was a les 'til I went ahead and screwed her straight
Ay, undo your bra with one hand
If anything is gonna care it on and cum can
Cum again, invite 'em if you have any fun friends
I love it when it's girl upon girl with one man
Ay, put your butt on my mustache, fuck that
Won't eat unless your shavin' the muff back, puff pass
Rub 'em from the front to the butt crack
She love it when I play with my tongue, I'm just sayin'

[Hook - Mars:]
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn

[Verse 3 - Tyga:]
Now, now, let's get acquainted
Shots of CÃ®roc how you let up like Vegas
SL painted
Top back drop take a photo half-naked
Don't be lazy
We on that, everyday a wet dream, baby
Sex on the beach by the leather on the seats
Lookin' for some head, I don't really gotta think
She said you know where I be, Roosevelt suite
Haha. Sunset women like the best
Walkin' at the light like I can change your life
Yea, yea, I rarely see the same girl twice
Let me get her number then I'm fuckin' tonight
Tell her call her friend then we fuckin' tonight
She left that nigga, watch, I'mma do it right
Ain't nothin' to these dollar bills in my high fashion
Champagne glasses pourin' on they asses
So many girls, I ain't never gotta act. Just say

[Hook - Mars:]
I wanna do it to you. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn
So let me blow your mind. (We ain't gotta fuck)
I'm talkin' white soft porn


[Verse 1]
To all my niggas on the porch getting their hair braided
Corn rolled by a L.A. bitch
And I can't forget
My niggas riding the train Yankee fitted 
Thermals under that Pelle shit
I love New York but gangbanging that's L.A. shit 
And I'm proud of it
Spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are you can turn it down fuck it 
I can shoot a video to it and spend half the budget 
I'm gangsta, let the .40 cal blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot the more I suffer
Cause we trapped inside a world where your forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doing life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Than break up the streets of Compton and spill my blood in the pavement

[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they goin lay me down
And then I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they goin lay me down
And then I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal

[Verse 2]
Who I gotta talk to who I gotta write
Get my Reebok deal done 
Or I'm stayin' in Air Nike's
Aiight, I handle bars you ain't gotta ride a bike
To peep game and his skill here go some training wheels
Let's roll
Through the city of god
Where LA niggas train to kill
Chop you up hundred times worse than the Haitians will 
For real naw Pharrell I need a track homie
Dre we to close aint no turning back homie 
Deal with it I'm a be here for ten years
Spittin like the ghost of Eric Wright and Big yeah
Let me paint this picture 
While you sit here thinking in the back of your mind this is the shit yeah
I spit for you niggas doing 25 on they 5th year ready to throw a nigga off the 5th tier
Them white boys in the Abercrombie and Fitch gear 
And every nigga who ever helped me get here 

[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Niggas keep sayin they gon heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal

[Verse 3]
One brick, two brick
The boy moving weight
Now three bricks, four bricks
I'm driving upstate
Five Bricks, six bricks
The nigga got cake
Not rap money, but money been rap since â88
Look at the world we live in
Niggas steady hate, to the heckler at Koch
Leave him chopped up like freddy's face
Niggas catching feelings
Cause I'm about millions
And outta all the newcomers out, my flow's the illest
You a close second nigga,
A banana to a guerilla
Put us in the same cage and I'ma have to peel âem
The best of both worlds
Rapping and drug dealing
Run and tell the chief I came to burn down the village
The head honcho, staring out the third story window
Of my Beverly Hills condo
With two long ass heats 
I call âem Shaq and Alonzo
You niggas want me outta L.A.
Yeah I know

[Hook]
Believe me niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

Niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talking that shit like they gon' lay me down
And when I come through strapped to see what's up
Niggas really don't know parts of me pal


[The Game]
Yo Havoc, I'm too close to the edge on this one nigga
I ain't gon' jump though, I'ma keep it raw gutter
Yo Prodigy, you know I need you on this one nigga

[The Game]
I got shit on my chest, I must confess
Last night I was the nigga that shot up your projects
Now I'm back in the hood, with rocks in the Pyrex
Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggaz
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son

[Chorus: Faith Evans]
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
Cause, the, game, don't, change

[The Game]
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no +Unsigned Hype+, nigga *FUCK* The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggaz breathin the same air as me, actin like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'ma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga cause reality is

[Chorus w/ variations + ad libs]

[The Game]
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game set in stone, the Frank Muniz set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin to be the king of the streets, niggaz'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nuttin between all my niggaz that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packin toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin my pivot
On my block in the Coupe readin kites from prison
I got niggaz doin life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

[Chorus - 2X w/ variations + ad libs]


[Mary]
Can't wait til we make real love
Because these conjugal visits just ain't enough
I'm really lookin forward to a future for us,
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

Even took a second job
So they won't take the cars and put a lean on the house
I know it's gonna be a while before you get out
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waitin on you

And them dudes you ran wit are foul
They been tryna get at me, ever since you been down
Even my girls are tellin me, I should end it all now
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

[Game]
All I can think about is that honey complexion
And the way your skin glow when you slip on them D&R dresses
I know you wonderin why I got you a Smith & Wesson
Cuz them niggaz in the hood is the reason we stressin
I miss that gangsta lovin and that lil affection
And butter soft lips when you kissin my chest and
Mary I put nothin above you,
And behind that vest I gotta heart ma, gangstas need love too

[Mary]
Some think the worst of you
They betray you as a man it's not that far from the truth
You were caught up in the game and now it's caught up to you
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waiting on you

[Game]
It use to be caramel skin tones, spreewell rims on
Glasshouse, ass out, Jacob watch, gems stones
Bandanna, Nike airs, tennis bracelet, wife here
Black rag, do or die 45 right here
Everytime I was down you was always right here
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right there, Chain hang ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear
I need you to hold me down

[Mary]
I'll be waiting on you (I)
I'll be waitin on you (ima be right here whenever you call me)
I'll be waiting on you (ooh)
Baby don't worry bout it, ima be right here, waitin on you

[Game]
I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cuz the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here ion know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bussin that tre pound
I would neva ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach, in Saint Tropez sound
And no more out of town trips on the greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre out

[Mary]
I'll be waiting on you (I'll be waiting)
I'll be waiting on you (ima be right here for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (I'll)
Baby don't worry about it (don't worry baby) ima be right here, waitin for you

I'll be waiting on you (ima be right here waitin for you baby)
I'll be waiting on you (you know I'll)
I'll be waiting on you (whenever you need me)
Baby don't worry about it, ima be right here, waitin on you

I'm lookin for a future with u baby,
I wanna see you real soon, real soon real soon,
I'll be right there, I'll be right there

Baby don't worry about it (don't worry) ima be (don't worry) right here (don't worry) waiting on you (ooh)


[Verse 1]
I woke up out dat coma, 2000 and 1
Bout the same time Dre dropped 2000 and 1
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude Volume 1
Rap critics politicin
Wanna know the outcome!
Ready to die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like Pac, after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind the G-Series and All Eyez On Me
I watched the death of a dynasty!
So I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr.Dre was a "DREAM!"
I had visions of makin' a classic
Then my wall turned black,like I was starin outa Stevie Wonders glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine,like Kanye West
Comin back from a fatal accident, to beat makin' and rappin'
But, we da future
Whitney Houston told me that, it's gon take mo' than a bullet in a heart to hold me back

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce 
Lettin the ink from my pen bleed 
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a "DREAM!" 
Aaliyah had a "DREAM!" 
Left Eye had a "DREAM!" 
So I reached out to Kanye and "brough you all my dreeam!" 

[Sample playin "It's cuz I love you!"]

[Verse 2]
I had dreams of fuckin' an R'n'B bitch like Mya
When I saw dat ass on a front of that King
Read the article in a magazine
She loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm the glass house havin' nasty dreams!
Good girls neva' give it up
But anything is possible ,if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles,found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like, Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream about bein' Unsigned Hype
Till I was crushed my Dave Mase, almost let my pen fall asleep on a page
Daydreamin' yesterday
Dozin' on offback stage
I tought I saw Eazy talkin' to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over heard Jam Master say
It's a hardknock life, then you pass away
They say sleep is the cousin' of death
So my eyes wide open cuz a dream is kin to ya last breath 

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce 
Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed 
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a "DREAM!" 
Aalyah had a "DREAM!" 
Left Eye had a "DREAM!" 
So I reached out to Kanye and "brought you all my dream!" 

[Sample playin "It's cuz I love you!"]

[Verse 3]
The Dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The Dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you!
Who walk through the Whitehouse without a business suit?
Compton had Jerry Curl drippin' on Ronald Reagens shoes
Gave Mike Lim my demo came here to pay my dues
Started of with Whoo Kid then I started blazin' Clue
It was all a Dream like BIG said it be
Don't sleep on me homie I bring nightmares to reality
Rap Phenomenon defyin' the rulez of gravity
Studied all the classic start revisin my strategy
Cuz Marshall Mathers made it
Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds wonderin where the hell Marvin Gaye went?
How do I say this, I'm livin' for my son but I can't figure, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus Piece like a Cathlic Nun
The War to be a rap legend has just begun

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce 
Lettin' the ink from my pen bleed 
Cuz Marthin Luther King had a "DREAM!" 
Aalyah had a "DREAM!" 
Left Eye had a "DREAM!" 
So I reached out to Kanye and "you are my dreeam!" 

[Sample playin "It's cuz I love you!"]

[At the end GAME talking:]
This song is dedicated to Yutandey Price the sister of Venus and Serena Williams who was slain
during a gang shoot-out in Compton, Sunday September 14th 2003, Rest in peace!


[50 Cent]
Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes 
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat 
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night 
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus (50 then Game):]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

[Game]
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride 
And if I gotta die rather homicide 
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus - 50 Cent]

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Game]
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted 
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

[Chorus X2]


It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that... chronic, chronic, chronic, chronic
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that... hydrolex, drolex, drolex, drolex
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that... Westside, Westside, Westside, Westside
It's that, it's that, it's that, it's that... Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton

[Bridge]
It's not that I can't stop, It's that I won't stop, I make it hot (I do it)
I'll be on top, as soon as the beat drop, I'll make the whole club rock (I do it)

[The Game]
Lace my Air Ones up, put my gun up
I don't need that I'm riding wit Dre
Who don't love us, every hood throwin they dubs up
Who the fuck yall thought was comin after Young Buck
hip hops worst nightmare, Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black nike airs
You want war, we can settle it right here
I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah
Or you could give me ya bitch, her with the light hair
Sit her next to these yellow bottles, tea right there
Matter fact I'll take you in the back
you in the hat, and you in the blue and the black
Lets have a gangsta party
Somebody lean over and tell Banks to order another case of fortys
Yo Doc give them a coke with that, wake up the west coast is back

[CHORUS]
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
Show you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
It's the motherfuckin chronic nigga thats whatsup - roll that blunt
(I can take you hiyaaaah)
G-Unit, Shady Aftermath I'm the motherfuckin Game and
(I can take you hiyaaaah)

[Bridge]

[Game + (Snoop Dogg)]
Like Dre did, I created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did
From the hood -liquor- store to the state pen
This is gin and juice
the doc made the club R.O.C. without timbaland boots
First nigga to put drolex on a bentley coupe
You wanna piimp? I perm my shit up like snoop (Westside)
Chronic 2005 motherfucker, put the purple in the dutch
"Let it Burn" like Usher giirl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggaz just pull up they pants and lean back giirl
Make 50 spill his cris, he'll call you a bitch
I'ma call you and hit , you can ya girlfriend, we can make it a flick
I got the lollipop if you wanna lick
Or you can take a ride on the magic stick

[CHORUS]

[Bridge]

[Game]
Put 25's on the hummer, why not
I'ma be here for the next 10 summers
Drop me in the 4th quarter I'm fuckin up they money
I don't need sound scan I'm doin my own numbers
When that impala bounce you can see the chrome under
I got em' in every color yea I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
low ridin with a hood rat or a grown woman
And I'll do anything but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
cause she got a forehead just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want, you thought Dre retired
Left me in 6-4 his Dayton wires
These niggaz is a waste of rhymin, Doc got somthing to say be quiet

[Dr. Dre]
Look out for Detox

[CHORUS]

[Bridge]


[A Man]
Alot of people are advocated that the rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer.
Thats only because you dont understand
whats going to happen to you, you see its all just a game ladies and gentlemen,
and the quality of your living depends entirely upon your ability to play the game,
and i play the game.......


[Verse 1: The Game]

June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, "What Up," shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]

They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was lamaze class, breathe baby
"One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four)," I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, "Jayo tell Spiz I just cut the umbilical cord"
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 3: The Game]

I wanna thank Dr. Af and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle Zip, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and "D-Mack" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging "Ready to Die," track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son

But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son

My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you


[INTRO]
3 Minutes my nigga...Ya'll know what it is..Just Blaze!

[VERSE 1]
Gangsta Gangsta that's already evident.
Nigga wit a Attitude, check, check my residence.
Whether I'm Crip or Blood, Homie, that's irrelivant.
I'm with the D-O-C, there's nobody better then the west coast felon when he on that lowrider
Bike pedaling, Somebody tell Eazy they still yellin' it.
I'm with ya homie Doc Dre on the television while these niggas moving peanuts like a elephant.
I'm on cars like spinnin' rims.
I'm in a class all by myself like the brown Eminem.
Not to down Eminem I fuck black bitches, fuck white bitches, nigga I like bitches.
Them half and half Alicia Keys dyke bitches.
If the head right, I might Air Nike bitches.
Or put 'em on a track like Just Blaze, I look down on hoes and look up to Dre, cause ain't...

[CHORUS]
No More Fun and Games.
[scratches and mix-ins]

[VERSE 2]
I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tia rolled into One.
Used to move birdies 'till I put a hole in one.
Nigga they thought I wasn't holdin' a gun, they try to ride up on me like Afeni Shakurs only son.
Dre told me he ain't doing Detox, this his only run.
Mase coming back and Hovie done.
I'm surrounded by legends, sitting at the round table, I am The Game and still niggas tryna play
Dude.
I'm Ruthless, I ain't talkin' 'bout the label.
I hook niggas up and I don't mean free cable.
I mean I hook niggas up to the I.V, the same way Dre hooked me up to Ivine.
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing.
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming.
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Hellin' me, tell Dre put up a mill cause that's what my bail
Will be.

[CHORUS]
No More Fun and Games.
[scratches and mix-ins]

[VERSE 3]
I been rapping for 1 year 1 month, 17 days.
13 hours, 28 minutes, then I met Dre.
30 minutes after I bought the new Em, that was November 18, 3:09 P.M.
Around the same time Wanksta got it's first spin, that was 32 weeks before they signed Rakim.
8 Months, 13 Days, before I knew a Mike Lynn.
And 3 Years after Mase done turned his mic in?
I start writing 22 months and 20 weeks prior to Lebron shaking Adidas for Nikes.
I'm right here, 6 years after Randy Moss caught his first touchdown for the Vikings.
1 day, 7 hours, 14 minutes, 21 seconds before Soundscan got printed.
2 Platinum Records for I'm classified with Biggie.
And 2 seconds before the song finish, yeah.

Strings in they g-units. get groupie luv,
Tell em to keep movin, if I gotta problem wit a bitch
I let eve do it. unless she got on La Perla
And I can see through it, I don't just let her ride
I give her the keys to it. me n my bitch layed back
In the coupe, I'm movin in the neighborhood I ain't
Passin through. I woulda been here afta snoop,
But I slowed down and showed timbaland how to iron a khaki suit.

[Chorus]


[Chorus]
Got to live for today cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
Don't just want a piece I want my whole destiny
(If you got it)
I'm gone take it
(If you're in it)
You're coming with me
(Bench warmers)
Get no playing time
(No sleeping)
Till I cross the line
I'm runnin'

[The Game]
With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
blowing horns like Miles Davis at the pearly gate
God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But (I'm runnin') like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggaz be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggaz in the grave the other one in the pin
She fuckin my enemies inside my homeboys Benz
Now she beggin God's mercy cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike and the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient
True story

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
If I get knocked with my gun nigga I'm runnin'
If I catch a murder one nigga I'm runnin'
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on runnin'
I ain't Nelly but my desert eagles on girl
Just dropped bail traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil
This shit real fuck an appeal
D's want my head like that bitch in Kill Bill
Sling dope sling crack and them e pills
That's why I'm on the low like a damn navy seal
I'm runnin'

[Chorus]

[Game]
Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from Go
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features
My Eminem sixteens
My Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggaz threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head
I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggaz they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggaz trying to gun me down in the rim shop
Cause I just want the same recognition that the crypts got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make yo chest move
Sylvia Rome and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move


[Intro - Dr Dre and (Game)]
Ah man..
Ey game.. dont tell me you love her
(I mean I like the bitch I dont love her)
Next thing you know you gun be all boogo upped with her and shit
(fuck that)

[Chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg]
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Whether we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

[Verse 1 - The Game]
L.A.X. to J.F.K. thats where it all happened
Caught you walkin out that gucci store in manhattan
I was in chains and cuffs, you was with cha girls
I was in that aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world, baby girl
You had dreams of startdiling,
The prince of compton meets the queen of harlem
First date at mr choas it was coushier? I would coach ya
La Pearl, Guccie, Louie, Fendi, Prada, Dolce
Runnin circles in my living room, tearing up sofas
Meclarin or rover, fuck it ma lets tear up the highway
Let the sprewells spin till the plates fell off
Then we could go 1 on 1 at dres house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out
You rockin the fly way that lil bit of compton mixed with (bed sty way)"?
And girl im not trying to excite you,
Im tryna wife you, bamboo earing, white air nike you

[Chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg]
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Whether we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

[Verse 2 - The Game]
I like your style, like the way you move, the way you talk
The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you licken your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me, im down for you
You go down on me, ill go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man wont do
Im from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and g-unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the lambo move
Ill take you to new york city, atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers thru
And you know...

[Chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg]
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Whether we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special

[Verse 3 - The Game]
Let me tell you bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and keys
Your boyfriend dont like me, cause he dont get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the porsche and his keys
Hop in the range rover, you aint gotta force him to leave
I gotta chrome four four on my jeans
You got gucci frame covering the mark on your face
Cause he dont want you to leave and I dont want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out tha CLK
I know he treating you like k-ci did mary j
I wanna ease ya pain, kick off your Louie sandles
Let me wipe your tears with my g-unit bandana
Make me wanna peal you out them jeans when you rockin em
Its "me and my girlfriend" like tupac and them
Jay-z and beyonce or bobby and whitney
We the '05 Bonnie and Clyde, you feel me

[Chorus, x2 - Nate Dogg]
Girl ill do anything to make you feel special
Man its easy to see you special to me
Whether we lovers or friends we'll always be
I want you to know, your special


[Intro]
Aight
What the fuck are you lookin at self
You want a piece of me
Ahh man shit
The story of my life...

[Verse 1]
If I could start from scratch I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana same 45th
Same g wagon same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin up my shit
Same telephone booth same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt same address
Same dog food album bangin in my tape deck
Homie if I could make 94 today
I'd tell easy and dre to bring back N.W.A.
I would have told Pac not to stomp Orlando
Told puffy and B.I.G about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies
Fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga tez
Seem like we was jus' in magic city yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy charles he would say...

[Chorus]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

[Verse 2]
Homie if I could rewind the hands of time
I would of cut of the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangsta I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot wit my own 9
I was 2 beeps away from a flatline
When you a bad boy niggas don't wanna see you shine
Dre said its my turn
He call it game time
23" Lexanis bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring baby luny back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole k
Got shot 1 time
That was a coo nigga I wish he had 9 lives
My brother devon died coz he chased the cat
This a dog eat dog world Jesus please holla back
I got a confession to make its called payback
If y'all don't wanna listen show me where pastor mase at

[Chorus]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

[Verse 3]
I would have told Big Will it rain every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would have told Vita to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy
That mean the beef is over
Told meesh to take the porsche back
Drive a rover
Told slim hit reverse on that hardtop nova
I would've change a couple of lines when I wrote soldier
So I wouldn't have to live lookin over my shoulder
My life is like an impala ridin 3 wheel motion
I've been front to back
Side to side
Level my 6 4 frame out
Keep on rollin
Keep your family far away and your enemys closer
Picture The Source suckin Benzino's dick
Tryna be the big fish in the pond
You know how them piranhas get
You dead when dat green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch you couldn't change that

[Chorus]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain off my past
If I had another chance I would do just that
I'd give anything jus' to go right back

Go right back.....


[Boy talks to lady to start the song]

[Verse 1 - Game (DRE)]
What happened in hip hop
That got pac and big shot
The thicks blocks
Now every rapper claim 
He let his clique pop
But even myself tote a gun
To know the run then get shot
Ive been there before
Now im fuckin with doc
(Gotta do the Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not i push rocks
Intisipatin my encarceration
Media think im fakin like mason
But when it comes to mase
Fuck r kelly i dont take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it
And im putting you under the pavement
No buddhist priest, catholic, or babtist pastor can save him 
Im far from religious
But i got beliefs,  so i put
Cannary yellow diamonds
On my jesus peace
I came back from the dead
Without a part of my chest
Layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years 
While everyone else dropped
Now i understand why NAS
Did a song with his pop

[Chorus x2]
Im ready to die
Without a reasonable doubt
Smoke chronic and hit it 
Doggy style before i go out
Until they sign my death certificate
All eyez on me
Im still at it, illmatic
And thats THE DOCUMENTARY

[Verse 2]
If i die my niggas, fuck it
I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from faith
No verse from Jay
I guess on westside story
He thought i spit in his face
I told Ed Lover & Moni Love
I was talkin to Ja
With that mayback line
It was payback time
Keep fuckin with me nigga
Ill put you under me
Take your car and trade it in
For eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T
I dodt your eyes
You'd do life in a cementary
I'll do mine with shyne
Come home sit in the thrown
With my legs crossed
And my air force
Middle finger rough
Fuck the world
Cause im fellin like puff
When life after death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems
And i lost my best friend
Im the second dopest nigga
From compton u'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums
Every 7 years  (haha)

[Game (Commentator)]
(You know what speakin of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song westside story)
Ohh Ohh
(You got a line that says
Dont wear throwbacks 
Or drive, ride in maybacks,
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Naa, i was talkin about Ja Rule
Yeah, So, Yeah, i got a lot of 
Respect for Jay
You know what im saying
I never take shots at legends
Thats just something i dont do

[Verse 3 - Game (Busta)]
Let me tell you why i do this shit
Im a son of a gun
Cause moms was a hoover crip
First day i got signed
I had to prove i spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes
(son duck is sick)
Told to Jay and Doc Dre.
I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and cube gone
The q gone
They say truth hurts
Chunk, like quick sand
Dont stop me in traffic
And ask about hitman
I gotta restore the feelin 
It crawled from under the rock
After the dog pound
Crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed 
Im the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan
After i sell 5 million
If i tell you i aint game
And i dont know Dre.
You gonn do me like x-zibit
And cut half of my face?
I take all the credit 
For putting the west 
Back on the map
If you aint feelin that
Go sign Gorilla Black!!!

[Chorus x2]

(DOCUMENTARY)


[Hook - 50 Cent]
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it so show us some love

[Verse I - Game]
Fresh like, unhh; Impala, unnh
Chrome hydraulics, 808 drums
You don't want, none
Nigga betta, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some
Pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
Since red, rum
Ready here I, come
Compton, unh
Dre found me in the, slums
Selling that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was selling rocks when Master P was saying "Unnnh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum
Got weed on the ton
I'm banging with my hand up her dress like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna, stunt

[Verse II - 50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-ca-lade
Low pro's so low look like I'm riding on blades
In one year mang, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly going both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rocking with the best tre pound on my hip
Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good
Cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

[Hook]

[Verse III - Game]
I put gold Daytonas on that Cherry Six-Four
White walls so clean it's like I'm riding on vogues
Hit one switch mang, that ass so low
Cali got niggaz in New York riding on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to ya just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rocking with the best fo' pound on my hip
Gold chain on my chest (Ah!)

[Verse IV - Game and 50 Cent]
[50 Cent]
50, unh
Bentley, unh
Em came 'n gotta nigga fresh out the, slum
Automatic, gun
Fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up ya punk ass, stunt 'n ya done
Homie, it's Game time
[Game]
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker, crunk
It took two, months
But Fifty got it done
Signed with G-unit
Had niggaz like, "huh?"
Don't try to front
I'll leave yo' ass, slumped
Thinking I'm a punk
Get your fucking head, lumped
Fifty got a, gun
[50 Cent]
Ready here he come
Gotta sick, vendetta
To get this, chedda
Meet my Ba, Retta
The dra-ma, setta
Sip Am-a, retta
My flow sounds, betta

On tracks I'm a savage

Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)


[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game b!tch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go

[Verse 1 - The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, 
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was 
We started throwin cinthi and decided to chase 'em
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

[Chorus:]
[The Game]
So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Your mind's lost, you are not ready to make that flame switch
You will end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waiving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going...

[Chorus:]
[The Game]
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power

[Verse 3 - The Game]
Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Eminem just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody on my under the pennalton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimmy Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a glock that don't phase me, 
I'm crazy why you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me, I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks

[Chorus]
So I'm gone bitch
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changin
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power


[Verse 1]

Crip niggas, Blood niggas, S.A.'s, Asians,
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, White Boys, Jamaicans,
Latin Kings, Disciples, Vicelords, Hatians,
All these mother fuckers been patiently waiting,
Since the west coast fell off the streets been watching,
The west coast never fell off I was asleep in Compton,
Aftermath been here the beats been knocking,
Nate Dogg doing his thing DPG still poppin,
I got California love fucking bitches to that Pac shit,
And westside connection been had it locked bitch,

I'll put red dots on that nigga head like rodman,
All stars, phat laces, gun charge, court cases,
Fought that, not guilty I'm back,
Niggas hate me been there, done that, sold crack,
Got jacked, got shot, came back jumped on Dre's back, payback,
Homie I'll bring your CA back,
And I don't do button up shirts or drive Maybacks,
All u old record labels trying to advance,
Aftermath bitch take it like a motherfucking man,

[chorus x2]

If you take a look in my eyes,
You see I'll be a gangster till I die,
That California chronic got me so high,
Game tell them where your from,
Nigga westside!

[Verse 2]

I'm lowridin homie, 6 Tre impala,
Gold d spinning, chrome hydraulics
Run up on my low-low you stop breathing,
Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini,
Gang banging is real,
Homie I'm living proof like Snoop Dogg C-Walking on top of the devils roof,
Rap critics wanna converse, about this and that,
Cause red strings in this converse and this a Dre track,
Keep jibberin jabbering I'll pull a .38 magnum,
And get the clicking and clacking,
You'll homies will wanna know what happened,
Come to Compton and see thriller like Mike Jackson,
I might be Spike Lee, of this gun clapping,
Prior to rapping I was drug trafficin
In the dope spot playing John Madden,
Homie I ain't bragging, I took five,
If u wanna die run up on that black 745

[chorus x2]

[Verse 3]

New York New York, big city of dreams,
I got my L.A Dodger fitted on I'm doing my thing,
Got me fucking wit G-Unit you know the drama that bring,
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens,
And Buck told me in Cashville I'm good when I come through,
So I don't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Poo,
I'm gangster more like Deebo when he was Zeus,
Play bishop I paint that picture now who got the juice,
You niggas is nuts so, I take off your roof,
Leave your ass steched out like a Cadillac Coupe,
God gotta let me in heaven all the shit I been through,
I was an OG in the hood before I turned 22,
Homie I'll let the .38 special rip through that vest,
And I don't contemplate whether or not he left that shit on the dresser,
Got Compton on my back,
I'm starting to feel the pressure,
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre Records

[chorus x2]

I want the rims nigga, and your gold chain
Don't blame me, blame 80s and cocaine

[The Game:]
Ay yo I wake up, put on chronic like bitches makeup
Kush like Nicki and Meek, it's hard to breakup
38 tucked, take a piss and eat my breakfast
Six bitches at my kitchen table ass naked
I got more bitches than Hugh Heff, nigga I'm reckless
Iced out Playboy pendant hanging from my necklace
Used to take a brick chop that bitch up in sections
Pack it in the car like its Mexican no flexin
It's that whip work, chop that, sell it out, we cop that
On Wimbleton and Brazil in my impala with the top back
Where my nigga Top at?
Remember them days before you and Rock brought Watts back?
We was in Stevenson Village in front your crib nigga
Leanin like a top hot, ordering Tommy burgers with everything
Cop back my Glock fat nina Ross Akon black
Bullets pop up out of nowhere like State Farm BLAT!


Granada, I'm falling under your spell

I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God

You know I get the kilos, cincuenta porciento
If you are not bilingual
Get the fuck up out of town, 'fore we run your ass down
Underground how I came out
Any nigga try to stop me let it hang out, let it bang, let it rain out
Yo soy el dios you adios nigga (I am the God)
Seen a nigga chopped up on a Tuesday
While the club goin' up on a Tuesday
This is goons day, I can have Guadalupe
Come through and knock Donald Trump out his toupee
Now look at his brains all on the sidewalk
And tuck the .38 and jump on my skywalker
And whew, I'm rollin'
Shotgun, Claudia, oh Shotgun, Claudia Ochoa (I am the God)
Only nigga walking through Sinaloa with the blood
Red Chuck Taylors on and you know it when I show up
It's a squad full of killers, squad full of hittas
Squad full of niggas that'll pull up, let it bark on a nigga
Hundred six shots bark on a nigga
Street sweeper wet the whole block up, Noah's Ark on a nigga
Got two Glock 9s, two .45s, two Desert Eagles
And they fly together side by side
No juego conmigo, tu sabes de mi
No Tony Montana, mis amigos mis kilos
Mi casa, su casa cuidado con el chico
Tu quieres la plata yo tengo perico
(Ya te dije el juego y fuego paisa)

I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God

Pinches policÃ­as (Puto)
Jodiendo todo el dÃ­a (CabrÃ³n)
Que si ora tu familia
O mi madre y mi tÃ­a, I see

I'm on a private jet with El Chapo, feet up
Sippin' Tecate bout to land for the re-up
Fuck the Montanas, we ain't got them trackin' devices
The feds they be watchin' and see us
Niggas wanna see us? Check the IG
I'm in the Villa throwin' blood up like an IV
Don't try me, DeJ Loaf with the AK
600 million, 400 million from Dre Day, uh
Pablo Escobar in my hey-day, uh
Bringing off coke that's a payday, uh
On a private jet that's a mayday, uh
In South America on a vacay, uh
P on my snapback, choppin' grade-a, uh
None of these niggas ready for the melee, uh
Hundred cal make his body do the nae nae
Leave a nigga face worse off than Sheneneh
I am the God, I've been tellin' you niggas
I got a bird and a chopper in the trunk
Ven aqui I will sell it to niggas
We can screw it and chop it
Machetes on deck, I will sever you niggas
Behind these bars, some El Chapo
Motorcycle out the cell on you niggas

EscÃºchame chingatumadre, nunca me encontrarÃ¡s
So para de mirar, no me controlas, te controlo
Controlo a todos me respetan o se mueren
Soy el Chapo y la hago en Sinaloa

I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, I am the God
El Chapo, nigga, I am the God

Nigga, I am the God


[The Game:]
Here we go again
Ten years later
You know what man? Uhm
(I wanna know)
Fuck it
Ayo C
Give me that Jameson and that pickle juice
Thank you
I got some shit on my mind
(I wanna know)

[The Game:]
My little nigga Frog dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(I wanna know)
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And Iâve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, Iâm like birdie at the troops
I canât lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I donât know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gonâ take it from me?

[Lil Wayne:]
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ainât nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
Iâm gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

[The Game:]
I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a Kumquat
I know who shot me cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but...
(I wanna know)

[Lil Wayne:]
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ainât nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
Iâm gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

[The Game:]
Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?
(I wanna know)


[ScHoolboy Q:]
Um, yeah palms sweating guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner looking dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't trying to change
Far from average, I'm smoking this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, four bars, living pipe dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
Might set the reason for the crime scene
Fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holding up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrapping, keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday
Seen homies die early age, though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway

[Jay Rock:]
B's and them H's, tats on faces, Glocks with extendos
Chucking up the hood then throw like 80 out that window
The chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leaving the club, murk you at Dennyâs
Squeeze till itâs empty, it seems so unreal
'Til the gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Dropping like fruit flies, we all know who die
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OGâs who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass Bâs is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway

[The Game:]
Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K scream 'til we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the Hoovers to the Hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty Hunters, nigga
(Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church
How that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, Huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without lowjack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

[ScHoolboy Q:]
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Crips, primarily African American gang
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Founded in Los Angeles, California 1969
By Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams
Though we still gang bang anyway
Today there's over a million Crip members worldwide
Associated with the blue bandana
Bloods, also primarily African American
Street gang founded in Los Angeles county city known as Compton
By Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens
A mission he formed to provide members protection from the Crips
Today there's over 5 million Bloods worldwide
The government still can't contain us
And our fate was sealed forever
When 17 year old LA brim Frederick "Lil Country" Garrett
Was murdered by west side Crips on June fifth 1972

[Crip 1:] Hey man ain't that Lil Country over there cuz?
[Crip 2:] If it is, his ass gon' be laying in a blood river
[Crip 1:] Hey man, make a u-turn and pull up on him real slow
[Crip 2:] Alright cuz
[Crip 1:] What's happening Fred?
[Woman:] Frederick, oh my god, oh my god Frederick no, no
Please, oh my God
Somebody help me
Y'all just gonna fucking stand there? Call the police
Somebody help me, please
Ok stay with me


Sometimes I pull up on Brazil and Wilmington like 3 o'clock in the morning, stop my car, let the top down.
Don't nobody know I'm there, just reminiscing bout the days when we used to be in [?] crack spot,
with my brother Fase, King Frog, Squid Big Dan, D-Bo, D-Los.
Back when Lil' Frog and Badass they was lil niggas, lil wild niggas running round the hood.
My nigga Slim 'Ru is in the joint doing ten. That's my solid nigga, on Bloods.
My nigga Peanut, he in jail now. My lil' cousin Domo and my homeboy Buddha Ru. This Cedar block

I remember days like this, my nigga
We was tripping cause we hated Crips, my nigga
Shooting out of six trays and shit, my nigga
He was slipping so we sprayed his six, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
A kid shot cause he raised his fist, my nigga
Fiends stealing cause they can't get a fix, my nigga
Sharing needles, passing AIDS and shit, my nigga
It's fucked up but I was raised in this, my nigga
Been smoking purple haze since six, my nigga
And my moms wasn't no lazy bitch, my nigga
I seen her hustle that's what made me rich, my nigga
But all this shit is overrated that's why I don't give a fuck no more
I don't want this Benz or this truck no more
I started off doing this shit cause I love this shit, Blood
Seeing the homie slap box, I love this shit, Blood
Sitting in my Impala like I love this shit, Blood
Weren't never 'bout a dollar, I just love this shit, Blood
Scrapping after school, Compton high wasn't bool
Could have went to Centennial but I love this shit, Blood
Used to bang Quik, yeah I love this shit, Blood
Mausberg was sick and I love this shit, Blood
Then I gave Wacko my demo outside of Food 4 Less
He came back in ten minutes like "I love this shit, Blood"
West side Piru, I love this shit Blood
Elm street to the Fruits yeah I love this shit, Blood
Crip neighborhoods too, even though they blue
Compton is where we grew and I love this shit, Blood

I seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done took some fades with Crips, my nigga
My own homies did some shady shit, my nigga
But that's the shit that made me this, my nigga

[Asia Bryant:]
All my life's been so complicated
But I will never turn my back on Compton
Our shit is so overrated
But I will never change who I am
So I'm riding for Compton
I ride, I ride, I ride, I ride for Compton

I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga
I done seen some brazy shit, my nigga

Got a voicemail from Braze, what's this, my nigga

[Voicemail:]

You know I only call you when its on some real shit, homie

2Pac, 2Pac, 2Pac, 2Pac...


[DJ EZ-Dicc:]
Yeah, it's time to wake up
Wake up and cake up
It's 187.4 FM on your dial
The number 1 station via satellite, CD radio and your stereo
Broadcasting live from the left coast
The land of la la, movie stars, pimps, playas, hustlers and thirst traps
It's W Balls, the station that murders them all with platinum hits
And this is dedicated to the ladies who love giving that sloppy toppy
Go 'head and pull that foreskin back, hold on tight

You requested it and The Documentary 2 is in your ear
And I am the DJ that is gonna sock some soul to your ass
Not the DJ that can save your life
It's ya boy, Kane Dingaling, AKA the original black spiderman
About to shoot a rope down your throat, it's DJ EZ-Dicc
Killing you softly with intoxication and a song that's guaranteed to put some dip in your hip
Right now you're listening to the sweet melodic sounds of The Game and the homeboy Deion
So kick back, get your mind right, red cups in the air
Sip on some of that gin and juice like it ain't no thang
And puff on some of that LA Confidential strain, yeah

[Deion:]
Pouring up the gin and juice (gin and juice)
Got a nigga feeling loose (got a nigga feeling loose)
Can you roll this blunt for me (yeah, yeah)
I'm just tryna smoke this weed (smoke this weed)
I spend all my life intoxicated (intoxicated)
And the chronic on deck (on deck)
Till we spark that grade-A

And shout goes out to our Instagram thot Shanine from the CPT
Yeah, she swallowed the nation and she's in our winning circle and she qualifies for that Blood Money swag pack
That includes the Blood Money gear, that Brazilian, Malaysian bundle, one year's worth of free visits to Dr. Fixaflat, the ass doctor

[The Game:]
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

[The Game:]
I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the car wash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O

[Harry-O:]
The way I look at it is like this, even me man, coming up in that game, right.
I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things.
And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that.
See that's what happened with Fat Boy when he disrespected me in the game.
But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma.
So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back.
You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between.
But I dun learned cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit.
What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge,
the jury or the situation cause karma gonna handle itâs business cause itâs (fair)

[Scarface:]
Late night down Sunset, liking the scene
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homies family tree
The lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing
When the last time I seen him, he was playing his tape
And he would lay the title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him
Whatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks
I guarantee that pussy shit'll stop
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

[The Game:]
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?
When the last time you seen 2Pac?

[The Game:]
Last time I seen him was in the mirror this morning
Riverside, motherfucker


[King Justice:]
My daddy ain't going nowhere
Never

Whether we dribble out this motherfucker
Wrap rock or riddle out this motherfucker
We gon' get up out this motherfucker
Same way that Venus did, Serena did, we them kids
Whitney was talking 'bout that's how it was
Before my brother caught them slugs and I watched coroners chalk him out
That ain't my brother in that box, what niggas talking bout?
Couldn't Paul Bearer cause I was too weak to walk him out
And that's real shit, I'm dedicated
Like Pac was to Jada before Jada met Will Smith
I'm already turnt up, chronic still burnt up
Fuck outta here, with all that lean and popping pills shit
Jump in my Impala get it hopping with a kill switch
I done been around the world, my life is like a field trip
I done been to Africa, seen niggas in Attica
Cops killing our youth, these numbers ain't adding up
Like that white boy sitting in a prison cell
Killed 9 people in a church, how he living still?
I couldn't understand, I spent hours
With Farrakhan, just begging him to let me be the millionth man
But some of these niggas just make you wanna kill a man
And let the .38 spin like a ceiling fan
Separate your body from soul, soul from Earth
Roll a blunt with your remains and then ash it in the dirt
Listen, you ain't a Christian cause you go to church
Listen, you ain't a gangster cause you got the work
A real gangster's one who take care of his whole family
Like me, even though my baby mama can't stand me
Her name tattooed on my neck, nigga it's branded
And my fucking kids tighter than Ray J and Brandy
Yeah, I give it to you so you understand
Fucking bitches took my family

Bye baby, rock-a-bye baby
No tears or sobs, baby, been listening to Nas lately
And I can't lie, baby, been missing them thighs, baby
But it's more to life than Gucci and Louis Vuitton, baby
It's more to life than tripping on lies, baby
Put feelings aside, baby, you Nicki Minaj, baby
One day we all die, baby
So I'd rather go hard, keep Cali alive, baby
Yeah, keep Cali alive, baby
Double entendre, nigga that's my baby
And don't nobody father kids like me
Word to Kevin Hart, take care of they rib like me
I made fucked up decisions but don't let 'em crucify me
I'm still the same nigga on my California ID
Yeah, Compton nigga
Blame Dre, it's his fault that I'm a monster, nigga
I was selling crack in west side Bompton, nigga
Yeah I can rap, but I ain't ask for no sponsors, nigga
I was light skin and young Klay Thompson, nigga
15, had guns like Contra, nigga
Now they call me bipolar, big contradiction
This The Documentary 2 without Doc's prescription
Motherfucker


[Harlem Taylor & King Justice x2:]
Remember me? Like father, like son
Had a million dollars 'fore I was 1
Cause my daddy hustle
We good now
Cause my daddy hustle
We out the hood now
Cause my daddy hustle

[Harlem Taylor:]
Winning like Steph Curry in the chip though
Used to be the only one, now I'm the big bro (I'm big too)
Know my daddy schizo, don't mess with his kids yo
Me and my brother tight (yeah), we like the Klitschkos
I love you daddy

[The Game:]
Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook
Buss

[Busta Rhymes:]
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

[The Game:]
I wanna thank my baby mamas Tiff and Eliska for everything
Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave
But I'm a father, and I'ma be everything he need and more

[Busta Rhymes:]
I'm glad you grew up to becoming everything you could be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
And in the end I'm glad you only turned out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
Your daddy told you it was coming
Coming, your day was coming, I told you
Now daddy's here just keep on running
Running, just keep on running, I tell you

[The Game:]
Every time I get in this booth
I'm reminded ten years ago I did it for you
Had this vision for you, and I know your daddy get in trouble sometimes
But I'ma stay up out this prison for you, I mean
You all my seed, lil' brother and both of your sisters
You all I need like Method and MJB
And I know I be wildin' sometimes, you told me ("Breathe daddy") (1,1, 2,2, 3,3, 4,4)
Furthermore, I'm try'na stay outta trouble just for my sons
Even though it feel weird leaving my house without a gun
I just gotta do it, cause they might grow up and do this shit
Just cause they father do it, fuck with my kids and six Bloods
Jumping out a Buick, understand Puff choking that man for Jus
I'ma do my stuff even if I land in fucking cuffs
For every nigga out here without a kid
Have one and that's gon be the best shit you ever did
One

[Harlem Taylor (King Justice):]
I'm Harlem, The Game's oldest son
I make straight A's and I'm a good kid
But more importantly, I'm safe
Because my daddy hustled his way out of Compton
So I could have a better life
That's my daddy
And I wish all kids had one like mine
The world would be a better place
One
(Wait Harlem, I wanna say something)


[Anderson .Paak:]
Tie on a bandana, then we lay him out
Fighting over two colours in the crayon box
It's no love
It's no love
40 ounces in my cup, I'm po'd up
We out here killing each other, but so what?
Keep it up and there's gon' be no Crips and no Bloods
Nigga take a look around, the crack game has slowed up
The government versus the people, now tell me
Who rules the world with only one desire?
I don't believe there's anything higher
Rather get it now than to read about the outcome
I'd rather have the crown, than a ribbon or medallion
And oh my days, I guess it's okay
If I lay up in the shade with my rent up in the mattress
But be at the course if I have to use patience
I'm shooting a premature dream in the napkin
Battling the evils in the flesh that I'm wrapped in
Waiting for my eagle, but the seagulls are distracting

[Anderson .Paak:]
What's happening, niggas? Mm
What's happening? Hm
What's happening?
What's happening? Mm
What's happening?
Mm, yeah

[The Game:]
What's happening? My nigga just died from Aids
What's happening? ISIS throwing grenades
What's happening? White boys shooting up a church
What's happening? My nigga 2-2 just got some work
What's happening? You can get it if you got it, nigga
But I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga
Who run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches
Even if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision
Right on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions
West side flourishing again, this what 2Pac envisioned
Obama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison
El Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen
Not me, nigga, one split second, I say "Fuck rap"
And if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains
And gave me 100 bricks and said "Migo, get it bracking"
I walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like

[Anderson .Paak:]
What's happening? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby
What's happening? Lost ones in the land of the crazy
What's happening? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes
But that don't make your basic ass Beyonce or Jay-Z
What's happening? Obama 'bout to move out the White House
What's happening? Couple hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out
What's happening? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card (yeah)
I wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah

[Anderson .Paak:]
Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Planning your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns

Black and white squares, just depends what side you on
(What side is you on?)
I want a red '64 Impala with them things on it

[The Game:]
Black out inside an abandoned crack house
Only thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes
That was the age 4, and by the age 10
They opened up the caged doors and let the fucking beast out
Fuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route
And get my shit the gangsta way, cause I can't be no Steve Stoute
I'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas
Potato cooking on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas
Funeral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas
Chrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas
Sway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas
I don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas
I break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas
Los Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas
Take a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas
Close one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas

[Anderson .Paak:]
Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one running again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Planning your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anything it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns

All I ever wanted was to ride my '64 down 'Shaw
Uh, I'ma spit them verses for my niggas
Dreams coming true, don't it always paint a perfect picture


[Jon Connor:]
Yeah, yeah
Let me talk my shit
Nigga, this that 90 miles per hour on the freeway, nigga
This that motherfucking black hoodie shit, my nigga

[The Game:]
Now we been baptized in a gunfire
These cops round here too motherfucking one sided
They fucking liars
Every time I hear these motherfucker's sirens blaring
I wanna put something through that badge
Hollow tips in your power steering
We say fuck cops and then them gun shots
All night we ducking them buck shots
We hear pop-pop! Nigga hop-pop!
You ainât strapped then homie why the fuck not?
Hearing guns cock, we hear one shot
It's a moment of silence for the whole block
Cause when one of us gone, it's like we all gone
Fuck that, yo I'm ready to fight!

[King Mez:]
Cause I'm so tired of this same old shit
Feeling like I ain't got not rights
Every time I turn around them red and blue lights
Always fucking up my night
And me wanna load up and put all you pretty motherfuckers up in my sight
All up in my sight

[Hook - The Game (Jon Connor):]
You done fucked up now
You done crossed that line
Wait till I come back

Till that shit go (braow!)
I done lost my mind
Niggas is bout to find out
(Somebody gone die tonight)
Fuck the police
Shit, fuck the police
(It's about to be a silent night)
All this blood on the streets man, fuck the police
(When that crowd ignite)
And unite like "Fuck the police!"
(better hug yo wife
Man fuck yo life!
Payback, payback)

[Justus:]
I done lost my fucking son because of this bullshit
Now I'm at the pulpit because of what I did with that full clip
And the judge and the jury, so fucking full of shit
Do you know how many times
These mutherfuckers try to pull this shit?

[The Game:]
And it's fucking murder
Hide behind your badge and get away with it
Thought it was protect and serve
But half the time that's really not the way it is
But you niggas got it coming
And you so outnumbered
It's bout to be a cold ass summer

[Hook]

And I'll be on my knees
Praying for the day
That you remember me
You'll come back this way

And who's gonna love me now, ay
Oh daddy why'd you let me down, down
Oh did you forget I was your flesh and blood
I need you to remember me

Ooh praying for the day
Cause Mama couldn't raise no man
And though she do the things she can
Every woman needs a helping hand


[My Flag]

Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging who you beefing with?

So basically, Fifty was on Hot 97 and shit, with Olivia, Lloyd Banks and Young Buck and shit doing an interview, and thatâs the time I was kicked out of G-Unit and that was news to me and shit cuz, you know, that shit was uhh like I donât know that shit just caught a nigga off guard. And I think he was kinda hot cause I did an interview with Funk Flex a few days before that where I was talking about, you know, his beef with Fat Joe and, and Nas and The Lox and shit. And I was like, you know, I grew up, you know what Iâm saying, on Nas and shit, and I wrote you know what Iâm saying, I fuck with The Lox and shit, and Joe always showed me love when I come to New York. So I was like, you know, shit.. I mean, I canât just stop fucking with niggas Iâve been listening to my whole life cuz this nigga mad at them niggas for the time being. So, uhm, he was hot, but anyway, them niggas on the radio, I got hot, so you know at that time, I was in New York with 70 bloods nigga, so we went to the radio station and shit, hopped in a bunch of yellow cabs and shit, hopped out the motherfuckers and we walked up to Hot 97 before we could get to the door G-Unit security was already coming out and shit. So them niggas pull out guns, so my little nigga Peanut pull out a gun and start bustin' shots in the air. So them niggas start bustin' shots, we start bustin' shots, and niggas runnin in the snow but we got em from converse and them niggas start slipping and fallin you know what Iâm saying, and then, fucking I think Jers got hit, Peanut got hit (Yo I think they shot Peanut blood) and Jers thought he was hit cause we hopped in the mo'fuckin Suburban and shit, and Jers had fuckin bulletholes in his North Face and shit, he was mo'fuckin whining and shit. Nigga Iâm shot, Nigga Iâm shot, and Iâm like Nigga you ainât shot you just got holes in ya jacket.

[The Game:]
You see I wake up in the morning
Grab my blunt and pull my dick up out this bitch mouth

Multitasking, cooking breakfast
Making a nigga wanna smack that ass
See, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said, "If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive."
Cause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't
I'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam
They had the bomb,
And if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga
I push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron
Make a nigga disappear like J-Kwon
Body found by the Swans
Nigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing
I'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if he do or don't die
He ain't never coming back
Now it's one, two, buckle my shoe
Padded leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do

Niggas can't see that we to blame
For putting Compton to flames
Ignite it up, haters knotted up
When you trip with canker sores in your whip
That's what I do, to protect my party
My goons snatch you out by your Ed Hardy
Then its back to shawty, all the ladies drink free
All the players grab a tab, that's how that's supposed to be
Drinking Casamigos, fucking faster than grand national regals
I'm in it in the pussy doing kegals
I'm so Fred Segal right now
She so spread eagle right now
Ain't nothing but the clothes going down
I'm in the game and the fire's the same
My music is infinite like even before my fame
I wrote about a thousand 16-bar verses
And I'm still coming off like this my first here

[Micah & Sevyn Streeter:]
I hope you giving head today

Say she wanna fuck his lil homie, got her sipping on that Alize
You ever had your dick sucked to Mausberg before?
And had a Mossberg pump leaning on the front door?
Treat my dick like a newborn, hold the head
I told a bitch "Pimpin' ain't dead, hoes are scared
So stop that bickering," I got a bitch from the Nickersons
That got a fucking bounty on my head, uh oh

[DJ Quik:]
I'm rhyming with Chuck Taylor too, he doing something new
Something more comfortable for you to just bang your shit to
So lady, go on and work those hips
Like them inmates work those divs
And when I get there baby work your lips
If it don't make dollars don't holler
It's DJ Quik in any year Impala
And if it don't make sense then don't flinch
What you hear from a bull that don't chew no grass?
No shit

The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan
Living in the D, checking in with the pimps and them
It's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula
Pretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to
Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard
The opposite of how these concentration camps are
Low-income housing, it dwells murderers
But children donât qualify for health services
The bourgeois act like they donât see starvations
Like they spraying EstÃ©e Lauder on sanitation

[will.i.am:]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybodyâs in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

[The Game:]
Streetlights come on, cop cars' lights flicker
They smoke us like cigarettes, need a light, nigga?
Used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Asked for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to bleed
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets
So before we look outside, we gotta look within
Cause, now, we the dinosaurs, I think the world 'bout to end

[will.i.am:]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybodyâs in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

[Nas:]
I'm from the project buildings, high stories
My stories from valence to glory
Dog-eat-dog world, gory
In the gutter, brother despise brother
Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, fools stamp debit cards
Your hood ain't no different from ours
We share the same dreams, same money
Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars

[Nas (will.i.am):]
The world's a ghetto, the world's a ghetto
The world's a ghetto (Ghetto)
The world's a ghetto

[The Game:]
Me and God's son, jumping out of project buildings in black parachutes
Both classic, both ride through the hood in a pair of coupes
Flow sick, mix the Henny with the Theraflu
He told me I was ill at that Houston's, nigga, where was you?
Hip-hop critics, sit the fuck down, get a chair or two
I ain't tryna kick knowledge, just a pair of graphic parables
Grew up, spent the whole middle school in the same pair of shoes
Me and my brother sharing shoes, my childhood was terrible
That's why I spend nights on the rooftop, smoking medical
You got a minute, my nigga? Let me break down the variables
Adapted to my surroundings, flow better than I used to
Momma, this for us buyers, for the days I wore FUBU
Having beaucoup dreams, deuce-deuce in jeans, my nigga
Now, I'ma end your career in two sixteens, my niggas
If he the God's son, then I must be the prophet
And all this "King of L.A." shit, you niggas need to stop it
(The ghetto)

[will.i.am:]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybodyâs in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

Uh, it's a ghetto
Uh, it's a ghetto
It's a ghetto
(You gonna take that top note or what, man?
We gonna do this harmony or we gonna do it right
This motherfucker Chuck gonna come here swinging
He's gonna come here drunk off that shit
Come on, now, let's get it right, tighten up, nigga
Hey, one, two, three, four)
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
One more time
It's a ghetto, yeah
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
Hey, it's a ghetto
(Alright, alright, alright, that sound good
But we need to work on this other one, now
Let's get it tight
Come on, Lyrica, JC, Pharaoh
Let's make this shit happen man, come on)
One, two, three, four
Oh, oh, oh, took your love away

[The Game:]
Old pussy ass mark, bitch ass buster
Think you from LA cause you listen to some Mustard
This is Battlecat, my nigga Kurupt had the battle raps
We go back like four flats on the Cadillac
Nigga you ain't never been to a hood day
You don't know Ice Cube, today was a good day
You ain't never been dropped off in the jungles
Teared Khakis, red bandana wrapped around your knuckles
Me and my brother used to dip down in 'Shaw
Stopped at the Weiner Schnitzel, got socked in the jaw
By some sixties, I bombed back, the nigga pulled out
A strap, said it's 6-0, I ducked then he missed me
Now I'm back to Bompton
Before I hit the hood, a nigga gotta stop in the Swans
And pick up a sack, had fifty for an eighth
And I only had fifty, made it last all day
Smoking with the homies, My nigga G Weed from Dallas
My nigga Hooter from Athens Park stay brackin'
Fo' line, deuce line, Bray still active
And the Cedars ain't giving no passes, why we asking?

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
How you gon bang if you really ain't from LA
We spray your gang up on the wall
Tell me
And how you gon' fade if you really don't know the dance
I see you really don't bang at all
Mark-ass

[The Game:]
Murder was the case that they gave Game
Cops on the colors cause they know a nigga gang bang
Red bandana round the rear-view
"Where you say you from, Blood?" Niggas can't hear you
Flag on the left side claiming you a Blood
Blue rag on the right side calling niggas cuz
Bout to get your mark ass chalked out on the West
This for all my niggas in the pen beating on they chest like

[The Game:]
I said I need some pussy on my motherfucking wall
And I ain't got my commissary yet
I said the next motherfucker try to steal a cigarette
He gon' get a fucking pencil to the neck

[YG:]
That's on the set
Ooh, I'm a Tree Top rep, all the
Homies know is shoot choppers, handguns and Tecs

Quisha and Miss Lisa, house, where we at
It's the gang bang capital, 2 T's capitals
Enemies know the business, this shit is factual
Bompton's most hated, fuck it, shoot out and fade it
So my mama stay awake cause her son be gang banging
You don't know about the put ons and DPs
Hanging out on the block coming through to squeeze
Some outta town niggas disrespecting
I see why Suge Knight and Big U was arrested
(Can't forget about the Mexicans)
And I fuck with the villains and the swans on God

[The Game:]
On God
I got niggas from Denver Lane that'll ride
I got esÃ©s that'll kill you at your job
I got some lueders by the Weiner Schnitzel
Hanging out with the pistols, making sure shit official
Big [?] and (they) both got stripes
Both locked up for life, so if I ever hit the pen

Fuck that
8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist

Man, I swear
My nigga tripping off the shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in
Cold water, then I order someone to bring him vicodin
Hope they take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of section 80
And you feeling like no one can relate
Cause you are, you are
A loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins
Make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party tripping off
My generation sipping cough syrup like its water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, no wonder our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition
That the world is bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
A melody and some hoes
PlayStation and some drank
Technology bought my soul
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that's product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, the president is black
She black too
Purple label on her back
But that tab
Is light blue she take it straight to the head
Then she look at me
She got ADHD

8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist

Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
They always told me ADHD did it

And then she started
And then she started
Feeling herself like no on else in this apartment
Beg you pardon
Oh, I rap, baby. How old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
OK then we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said where my drink at?
I'm a tell you later, just tell your neighbors
Have the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made it to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the new flow start to drown
Her body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now
It's nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked
At it, then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That ADHD crazy

Fuck that
8 doobies to the face
Fuck that
12 bottles in the case
Nigga, fuck that
2 pills and a half weight
Nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance
When your age don't exist

Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Like whoa oh oh whoa
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
Don't got a limit just gimme some more with it
They always told me ADHD did it

You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six
Just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, dro, hoes
Whatever you like
You can have all my shine
I'll give you the light


[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
There's fire in the street, fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
but I've cops circle the block, I puff squares
But I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch
On the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary

[sung by female]
Section 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell

[Ab-Soul]
Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it
I hope you participating
Aiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here like back in '04
Started HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator
and the system made to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist 'em
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if kids were celibate?
Or what is Tammy came across a real man
who didn't play games like chil-dren?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
with his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off twenty-twelve
and the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) but our future's not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five
Don't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)
And on another note
we focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul

[Kendrick Lamar (female)]
Life is a traffic jam (life is a traffic jam)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam (ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam

[Kendrick Lamar]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do
Section 80, your son will play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan and pay off your college degree
and do exactly what you see on TV

[Kendrick Lamar]
True story
Hmm, can you repeat that for me 'Soul?

[Ab-Soul]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now my child, come on

[Kendrick Lamar]
See a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
till one day I realised I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history
all in the same sentence
just know I meant it, and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up Terrace
('Soul!)

[Outro]
I watch this fire that we're gathered around
and see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you
Section 80, Section 80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No they can't control us, no they can't control you
No they can't control us, but we control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us
or our family
Heart, honor and represent
This is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeR


[Chorus: screwed Pimp C sample from Jay-Z's "Big Pimpin'" (Kendrick Lamar)]
"Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all"
(Pussy ass hoe niggas) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Bitches all up in my business) "I can't fuck with y'all"
(Industry of counterfeits) "I can't fuck with y'all"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
while I'm here, and every day I hear
your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up in the building, we get busy, and say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y
A-H, give it up two times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life, then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time will never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Don Perignon, when we finish, we say
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P, yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
and a button on your lips, don't blow my high

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody sing this shit

[sung by Aaliyah]
I'm sending him a four-page letter
and I enclose it with a kiss
And when I write, he'll be better
Get it on time

[Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life and look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P
R-I-P Aaliyah, R-I-P


[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar 2X]
Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
Whoa-ohhh, whoa-ohhh
We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Interlude]
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils
There's an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation, live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

[Refrain 1.5X]


In time you'll learn this is about you [x3]

Babies from 80s don't know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of the feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen
I'm just a nigga from Section.80

Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
On the real
This is your generation
Show, show your pain


[Skit:]
Gather around
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said... fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you
All of you

[Intro:]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high

[Hook:]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 1:]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck is you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower

(Reporting live from Planet Terminator X, I am Martin Luther King with an AK-47)

[Hook:]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 2:]
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I was kicking that Math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'mma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate, my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got 2, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... Gross

[Bridge:]
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us, they'll die

Wizard

[Hook:]
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga


[Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody put three fingers in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar-coat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, (dread) that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the Devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license
to kill, I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Alori Joh (Kendrick Lamar)]
Every day we fight the system
just to make our way, we been down for too long
But that's alright, we was built to be strong
cause it's our life, na-na-nah
Every day we fight the system
We fight the system
We fight the system
(Never liked the system)
We been down for too long
But that's alright, na-na-nah

[Kendrick Lamar]
Who said a black man in Illuminati?
Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
on the freeway to Africa till I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
loaded that clip and then said "Bang!", the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late 80s
Trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

[Chorus]
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his, HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

[Kendrick Lamar]
Thug life
Thug LIFE!


I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
Theyâll probâly think Iâm a terrorist
Eat my asparagus, then Iâm askinâ her
Thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for diamonds, I know you dyinâ to meet âem
Iâll probâly die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted

Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)

Yeah, big shit poppinâ

Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
Witâ my back against the wall and yoâ bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothinâ but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that Iâm easily peddlinâ with the speed of a lightninâ bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, Iâm too advanced
I live my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, Iâm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire witâ devils holdinâ hands
From the distance, donât know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? Thereâs no one
Not even myself, a Gemini screaminâ for help, somebody

Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)

Yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ
When you do it like this, nigga, losinâ ainât an option

Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)

Yeah, big shit poppinâ
(Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali)

24/7 nigga, workinâ his ass for it, she poppinâ that ass for it
The King of Diamonds witâ diamonds I never do ask for
They checkinâ my passport, Iâm too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff âim
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, youâll never hop in my lane
When you pushinâ a RAV4, you wreckinâ my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)
Holâ up (Holâ up)

Yeah, big shit poppinâ, everybody watchinâ
When you do it like this, niggaâ¦

I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimentinâ me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
Theyâll probâly think Iâm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor

Holâ up


[Chorus: Astro Bot]
Fancy girls, on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
The seven cars start honking, she start running
like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
See a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing
through that block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song

Mm, my little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
the day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Chorus: 2X]


[Kendrick Lamar]
Check, check, check, check...
It go

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things, don't do it like
he did, cause he ain't what you is, but we can win
Wait, let's get straight to the point

[Kendrick Lamar]
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this earth is, ain't a good place to be
How far is Heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
It go one, two, three
Two in the front, one in the back seat, seat
Seat, seat, looking for a victim of an AK-47
Hundred round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
Make a right, there they go, sometimes gotta

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens
A condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie
When I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face, then tell me don't worry bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngun with lack of guidance
There's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
That's on my life, but regardless I'ma

[Chorus]

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure, I lost one of my biggest believers, ohh
Close deaths make you think about your life
like if I had the same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
but tease her bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording, swear I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Mama, I just wanna sing
Mama said, according to get everything
you gotta risk everything
So I'm smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush reading Corinthians

[BJ the Chicago Kid croons to end]


[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you, put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful, all of the time, time, time
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind?
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day (today)
No makeup today-day-day-day-day-day
No makeup today
And girl that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind-mind-mind-mind?

[Kendrick Lamar]
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar (female)]
I know she bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on? It was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens
(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision
(of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction) I've outgrown
(I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much makeup
Yeah I know) your imperfections (I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from)
They tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows
(It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
is that I had a black eye) [beep]
To be continued, eleven

"Ladies and gentlemen"
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good [4X]

[Kendrick Lamar]
I used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressing, my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or Hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A MetroPC' phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right just so you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good [5X]

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Kendrick Lamar]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
That same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
I'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful, the city got my back
Before that, I give them my torso
You think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worry some individuals that live life critical
So won't you bare witness while I bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me, getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be
out of work, laid back, while he

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good [5X]

[GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to ya, holler if you hear me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move, and now that we took it up to the cathedral
cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking bout?
We out here rotating under the five Ps
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, you know what I'm talking bout?
Doing my thing, cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
from the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking bout? Church is definitely on the move
and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I'm talking bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it man
That's the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking bout?
Exercise your ism and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, chuuch! Ism


Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) Yessir
(Amen) Church
(He dead) I killed him
(Amen) bitch

And this is rigamortis
And it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus,
The Matrix in my mind
I'm out the orbit
You an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme
If you the shit then I decline
I climax when you begin
And then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph
Into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures
My listeners reply and tell me
That you biting style
You got a hell of an appetite
And I'm be here for a while
Just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight
We always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI, just might investigate
This fucking parasite

(He dead)
(Amen)

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity
This is studio felony
Pharrell got me too many
And cool enough for the 70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch
And bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant
Rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody
Couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q
It's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system ain't barbeque
Ain't nothing else you can do

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I killed him
(He dead) hahaha
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

I rapped him and made him Casper
I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya
I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners,
Won't you send us to Bible study faster
You hypocrit-esque is reaction of blasphemy
I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done
And tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds
Don't talk to be bout no money
The sun is under my feet
And I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap
My statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek
And I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody done see
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition, breaking up the streets
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention, how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick, in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen

Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) yup, yup
(Amen) I know
(He dead) for sure
(Amen) amen


[Ashtro Bot]
We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
with the top down screaming we don't give a fuck
Drink my forty ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude]
Oh shit nigga, something bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty ki's under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to vigilante, eighties so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fucking pantry
Peeling off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you getting fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothing harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a traveling freight train
Are you trained, to go against Dracula?
Dragging the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips and gold chains
You walk around with a P-90 like it's the 90s
Bullet to your temple, you're homicidal, remind me, that

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (RZA)]
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothing to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothing to fuck with
Compton eses ain't nothing to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch I love it
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop, woop-de-woop
Woop-de-woop, woop-de-woop-woop (California dungeons)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let's hit the county building, gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm driving on E with no license or registration
Heart racing, racing past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children on Ronald Reagan
raked the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch
(I'm really out here nigga) You blowing on stress hoping to ease the stress
(Like, really out here) He copping some blow, hoping that he can stretch
Newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
with calendars, cause your day coming
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hoping that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothing, because

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win
(Right, I had the chopper and I tore they ass up)
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

[Outro]
We really out here my nigga, you niggas don't understand my nigga
I'm off of pill and Remy Red my nigga, tripping my nigga


[Verse 1]
I know this girl
She a real good girl
And she be low-key
Looking like a star
With a real nice car
A Mercedes key
And she got a nigga
And she love this nigga
Well, at least I think
Everytime we bark
She pay us no mind
In the middle of the street
She be like..

[Hook 1]
Fuck them other niggas cause
I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas cause
I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas
I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga
Fuck them other..

[Verse 2]
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night
She checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on
Matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone
Was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go..

[Hook 2]
Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga
When she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga
Fuck that other..

[Verse 3]
I know this girl
She a real hood girl
And she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up
Big bamboos
Mike Jordan kicks with that
Big butt, but when I try
To holla, she don't exist
In her man she trust
So when I holla
She gon resist and her man she trust
So when I walk by her
She be screaming this..

[Hook 1]

[Verse 4]
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night
She checked his pockets
Found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged
She popped his eye
Then ran outside
Then started driving
On the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she go..

[Hook 2]

[Verse 5]
And so, these girls
These vulnerable girls
Took they men up
Put em in their world
Their vulnerable world
And just like that it was
Only getting they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the
Biggest question mark
They curious now
Cause when women get sick of men
They think of a big helping hand
To lend each other under cover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over
It'll be alright
The minute she hit the block
And turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go..

[Hook 3]
Fuck with other bitches
When they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches
When they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches
On the side cause these niggas..

Tammy's song


[Hook:]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is alumni
I'm a take my time, I'm a master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up
I seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign
Till I resign on your report
That I done you wrong, and I mean to know
My homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever
But however...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit
If he gave me a handout
I'm a take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo
Chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix
As them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad
HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash
Old friends I no longer have

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q (Kendrick Lamar)]
I remember when I came out and shit
Man it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
God dammit K Dot when it comes to this
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was motherfucking outchea
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should've been making bangers
I was somewhere stuck with a flame here
Motherfucker see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year
Can I get a hell yea?
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride
(Music saved my fucking life
I'm doing right
And you left behind
Feel my pain, now I'm styling
Heard this shit, I spent a thousand
Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mix-tape and it sold like an album
Reason why I'm...

Going big, bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Tell em I'm going big, bitch suck my dick
Yea I'm going big, bitch suck my dick

[Hook 2x]


[Chorus]
She look better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D., that girl's an alien
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
U-F-O fly away
So let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go
Let's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, she got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar, but still I feel ya
Energy is sending me toward the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
I gotta stare, I mean wow
and I'm wowed, no one compares
A one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in America when you was young
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy, insane, crazy
The only girl that can make time, then make me stop

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, so now we on, so now we gone
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it, rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
Gotta be an odyssey from Heaven way above
You definite, not probably, I gotta give it up
Lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
Body frame crazy, insane, crazy
The only girl that can make time, then make me stop

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
You something different
I'm glad I found you
So pretty
I'll never do anything to hurt you


The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing

Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either crip or piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and,.. real talk, and

[Chorus:]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, y'know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hold up
Where you from? "How-bang"
Where you stay? "Westside", that's a piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed to cross Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but

[Chorus:]
This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, y'know?

[Chorus:]
This is why they fuck with me [laughs]
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'm a leave you with this
An OG once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone


[Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live, Compton, California

Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
and life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain, let her know I wasn't playing
I was so (Sincere) like Nas' first name
And back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
for filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed
Fucking up my prestige, till I live with the blues
B.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}]
That's why I'm in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
(Through the barbed wire)
{We are, we are fighters
We are, we are true
Through the, through barbed wires
We will, will break through}
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the world stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon' have a baby, then flee from her education
At the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She will never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first
Fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser) {uncredited female}]
That's why she in the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
(Through the barbed wire)
{We are, we are fighters
We are, we are true
Through the, through barbed wires
We will, will break through}
So while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever felt like you finally got life?
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Living off your (dreams) like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat
of a convertible, eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like you just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, Ali
Now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
Making good decisions, got an independent business mind
And both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Ash Riser)]
In the club like fuck it though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
Know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path
(Through the barbed wire)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Just laugh, then everybody say

[Ash Riser]
Cause I won't get caught again
and I'm here to start the trend
You can't catch me if you try
Disappear into the night, and I'm gone

[Outro]
"So you made it past all the barbed wires?"
Just one more left [gun shot]


Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter [laughs]
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You boo-boo

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings
and if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney & Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making enemies my nigga
Oh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal
Where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art
Now paint that picture, life behind bars
Remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
Yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
And if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

[Chorus]
Cause every time you come around y'all be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... keep it running Ali
Every time you come around you be hollering that
whoop-de-whoop, blase-blah
He say, she say

So tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah bitch you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Tell 'em shut the fuck up
Yeah nigga you boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You thirsty, you T
You boo-boo, you turned down
You boo-boo, you T
You turned down, you weak
You weak, yo' bitch weak
Yeah [laughs]
You boo-boo, you T [laughs]
Keep all that

[Outro:]
What is HiiiPoWeR?
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it's known today that the human race is nothing
No moral, no standards
What we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
No you don't have to have a lot of money
You don't have to be rich
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion


[Chorus: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now

[Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what she said to me
That place I used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody
I'm trying to get it and she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what it said to me
But that place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt
My liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out, but I'm bout to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio, I wanna tell him nah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
That's what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me
Only a hundred and forty-four can go
Seven billion people on planet earth today
Is there something that I don't know?
I know to follow him, rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means I'm following evil
Guess I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need, but live like I don't need you

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what's important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life
And if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

[Jhene Aiko]
I'm trying to visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground
But we're always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world stand a little slower
Then I would, then we could grow a little closer
I think we're getting closer
I think we're getting closer


H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
H.O.C.

Everybody know I spit that hunk of shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
creation of man and Columbine

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your endo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

Look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights, off the chain like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted like forty gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking bout
You know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me like my son's bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale/in hell, like an atheist

[Chorus]

Uhh, I'll take you back to the ninth grade
when Dough Boy had me high for four days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
But anyway, I think it was some purple
Told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
Just underline every letter
Capital K-D-O-T, letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout?
Nothing huh? Am I square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar (screwed)]
H.O.C., H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C. (Bitch I'm blowed!)
H.O.C., H.O.C. (Bitch I'm blowed!)
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.
All the real smokers give me H.O.C.


"My nigga, what it look like?"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing, no cure
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
Police brutality kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst Iraq no direction
No google map, just a TEC for the soowoo
Swerving Isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
Mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
These commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
Supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
No place to live in, no Zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

"My nigga, what it look like?"
That's exactly what Hell look like, uh

[Chorus 2X: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is, nigga
Tell it like it is, homeboy
Tell it like it is, nigga
Tell it like it is, tell 'em what's up

"My nigga, what it look like?"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spitting
'Pac is rapping, Gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets
Cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs
Calling every human being... [fades out]


[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Y-O]
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
with no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of [?] speaking
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus

[Thurz]
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
on that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
I'm still serving broads on my chest for gratuity

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Skeme]
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Nigga's swag wavy, chauffeur got me car-pooling
So when it come to stunting, bitch I do it

[Brown]
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
We be shining blue and brown and got that golden Gucci
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
Hoes are choosing me cause hating we ain't, pimping, keep our balance

[Chorus 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]
These hoes want to love me mayne
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Chunking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
I'm bout to make that halo burn, goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside of Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker

Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this


Lord forgive me

[Verse 1:]
Kill him where he stand or stand over him shake his hand
Then jump back in that mini van, double back to his block
And blam I ain't backing down for nothing
I'm a back em down like Shaq with this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam, like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin' that a 187 land on your corner,
Coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead,
The next morning high toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana, want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don't know I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting
No sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something
Protect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion
Then chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics
Cause ignorance is bliss

[Verse 2:]
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
We all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off
Then peel off, in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably I'm too street
Indubitably I'm a do me
Better than your bitch would
But you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks
And I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you a parrot
Mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss

[Verse 3:]
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm so-Cal, you so called
Rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out to show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene
I remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down boggins
Backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin
You gon' tip her
Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker
As the speaker that spoke when they done speak


[female]
I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
Figured I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, every time I'm in my city I be hacking like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce

[Kendrick Lamar]
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on them twenty-sixes, I'm a vanity slave
I'm a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
I'm a Comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
A.K.A. that nigga, don't worry
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
This is HiiiPoWeR, since the Eddie Bower I've been popular
I'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks?
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
See too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't know why... "Hey, wait a minute motherfucker"

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I'm in my city I be feeling like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumping "Me Against the World", hello world, Kendrick here
And I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
That means I'm too/two much for these niggas, I'm three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

[Kendrick Lamar]
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
Only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Walking down to Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
Ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
Man, I know I can't tell you bout the world homie
But I know I can tell you bout your girl homie
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy crazy
I fucked nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me, too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it "Haul of Fame", once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Ciroc
Please no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
But I make that pussy pay me

[Chorus 2]

[Schoolboy Q]
I remember tripping, walking through the set like my Glock don't think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and I don't why you sucker niggas can't see
I'm from Hoover mayne, high as Supermayne, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy mayne with the pussy game, shit we off the chain
We popping ay, fortune, not the fame, shit you backwards mayne
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
Your broad that chose, yes she moving on, yep we do it wrong
We fuck the homes, fuck the center home, marijuana strong
You know I'm gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep you left alone, you gets none fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told Mary/merry was a (go), so we passed her (round) and (round)
Your bitch texted me, wants it now, so I had to knock her down
Work her bouncing on my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I'm done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy's crazy, her pussy's crazy
You fuck niggas

[Chorus 2]


I remember, uh
All my uncles, Sir Smokers
on the landra, in front of our building
They was my heroes

[Chorus]
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crackheads
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crackhead

Uh, and that's scary to me
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his Ps
Nigga cue me in, I'm a Peruvian drug lord
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some +keys+
This is crack cocaine, I'm Kurt Cobain
and I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-R-I-U, high you, I'm an I-V
This shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack... stop
I said an I-V cause when I be
in the studio, high shot, a needle in your vein
Take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey, I hate chickens
but I do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at?
Over the Pyrex where my world at

[Chorus]

Uh, and that's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Disease on K-Dot? Uh uh, better wake up
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn?
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eyedrops
I BIG, I 'Pac, you Chris, I +Rock+
That's pookie hom', New Jack head-first with a cyclops
I'm the first one to do that, I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't no higher, learn it
There's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

[Chorus]

Uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track it's a Reynolds wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat
You could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, I suppose
This is bigger than life
This is probably everybody Illuminatis
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
So my bad if I put you in rehab
You are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Aw dude, you about to fucking O.D. bro


[Female crying]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, yeah [3X]
Uh
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people...
I'm inspired, so get inspired

And so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con-artist? Why you couldn't
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?
Why you let me use yours cause I don't got mines?
Why you always lift me up when I'm completely giving up?
Or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you'll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you, sometimes

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Javonte)]
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
(Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall?
Where do we seem to fall?
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there)

[Kendrick Lamar]
And so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
out in public, curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying hi daddy?
Why you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I'm the last option after your homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me? Sometimes

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lamont Carey "She Says She Loves Me"]
She says she loves me, she says she loves me
so she clings to me even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen
and she only gives advice, she says when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning
she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me, she says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower
she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
she says, she says she loves me
And I don't know about love


[Intro]
"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, and I don't have no ends
Gina, I'm ass-out" [laughter]
"I'm going through something right now"
"I told you that"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
Well alright

[Chorus 2X: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice

[Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga!
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry ("hey what's up daddy?")

[Chorus 2X]

[beat switches up]

"So what you wish me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?"
Mhmm

[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me, when you let me...

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
That good shit stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you...

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
and caught that flat in the [?] flats
And it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
We often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car now due and you bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga
The antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga
But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

[Chorus 2X]

[Ab-Soul]
Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
'Soul, balls deep, ya dig?
Retrieve relief, ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
and lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
cause all I've been thinking the whole day...

[Chorus 2X]

[Kendrick Lamar - screwed vocals]
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron
Give me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on
Bitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
Where your friends at? I got long dick, what it is
Go on poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
When you let me, when you let me...


[Kendrick Lamar]
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6

Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
like should I start trapping? If what I write down
don't connect this very moment, then I'm on it, no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
"I thought you had a show?" Well I guess my nigga, I didn't
I'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 hinges
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with MAC-11s like fuck Hip Hop
Don't wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don't wanna be 'Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water
Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately I've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit

[BJ the Chicago Kid]
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

[Kendrick Lamar]
R.O.T.C., or Right On Time Conscience


[Intro]
I miss you, where you been?
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, I need you
It's been months and I haven't heard from you, come back to me
Come back, I need you in my life
I miss you, I miss you, come back to me, I miss you

[Dom Kennedy]
What's up baby? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
different girls, different towns
To keep it real, you missing out
I'll all bored, next city
Random cars, TEC's with me
Like I miss you so much, have sex with me
Not right now, look you know I got the ex with me
She like fuck that, I don't care Dom
So selfish and that really isn't fair Dom
Meet me here, where Dom?
Get undressed, yeah Dom
Yeah Dom, what you need?
Some bomb head? A bag of weed?
Good food? Japanese?
That's me on page forty in that magazine
"Dom Kennedy" you need that
She said nobody come close, I agreed back
I'm the nigga who used to help her pull that weed back
and she need me, believe that

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar]
What's up love? It's been a while
You been good? I've been around
Remember dinner dates I was late? Mr. Chiles
Truant like a student, you the principal
Schooled me on timing, we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
I was Your Highness, you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
for us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers posters
By my waistline, shout for your hard hit
You called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date Dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 K, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that?

[Chorus]

[MURS]
I upped and walked out, now she crying cuz
She need me, I got that John Bryan love
Had to find love, we called it punch-drunk
We was a two-piece, she was a one-punch
You know, a knock-out, and if she was to walk out
my heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we'd be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me
She need me, she need me
She need me, she need me
I would say yes, smiling so freely
That was back then, I bet she still need me

[Chorus]


[Intro: excerpt from interview with Dash Snow]
I'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that?
Alright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever
I try not to obey them at any time
That's what I believe in, not believing in
(So what keeps you alive?)
Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and
uh, what keeps me alive? Shit, um
Music, I have to listen to music all day long
I say that keeps me going
I'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times
and I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing

[Kendrick Lamar]
Thank you
Sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
And still I come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts
and Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect
I ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
You should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
Might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
Fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
I mean that from the bottom of my heart
You see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet
even when the enemy can throw salt
Still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
Let bygones be bygones, but where I'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
I'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga
inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas
My uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
He told me rap about life, not rap, niggas
That's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
My stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
I start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
We used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
Niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
And this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph
Wrap Saran our defiance, ban our alliance
Put burners in the hands of the black man
One hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant
You probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am
You probably even listen to "Faith" and think I know Zion
But really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
I got a big fear of flying
My future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying
I swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick
The school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
You walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know I witnessed
You just mind your bidness
You just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises
It's kinda scary ain't it
You can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous
Just let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?
Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation
Said if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
Your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God
I pray these bars get farther than Compton
And if my record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest
Secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
The people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come
And I'm like, the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month
Alright? Gotta keep it pushing
Can't let the government tell me how my future looking
I'm on Rosecrans & Central trying to duck the central bookings
If the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender
I've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta
In the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter
How splendid, I guess my project had did it
Got all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different
They said seven tracks, I said fifteen
Called it an EP, they said I'm tripping
But little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
Uppity bitches, handling bidness
Killing our dreams, stealing our vision
Out in Haiti adolescents barely have a home
In L.A. everybody think they fucking on
Hop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit
Who we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone
I swear to God, most y'all cats just don't know Kendrick
You barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended
Ain't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses
Occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's
just to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living
Look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind
Just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the... [coughs]

[Outro]
We would like to call this an appreciation tape
for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP
For this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D.
Because of you, we are Overly Dedicated


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin' like ya involved, like a rebound
Got no end game, got no reason
Got to stay down, it's the way that you making me feel
Like nobody ever loved me like you do, you do
You kinda feeling like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cryin' for no reason
I ain't just prayin' for no reason
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
I wouldn't do it at all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we're runnin' out of time

[Kendrick Lamar & SZA:]
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

[SZA:]
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer

King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watching
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the opps that miss it and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodging haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision

All hail the king, I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned
And the lens that I'm looking through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumping out, 'bout to spread 'cross all seas
Sisters and brother in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
And I'm still gon' fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you an accident, are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradicting what your body language say
Are you a king or you joking, are you a king or you posing?
Are you a king or you smoking bud rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
King, king, king, king
I am T'Challa!

Lil nigga think he cut, yeah I bet the nigga freeze

[DaBoii:]

Thumbin' through a 100 racks just to kill time
They got a nigga at the edge but I feel fine
But it come with this shit I'm okay with it
If your mans last year yeah I play with' em
One whole wood to the next, it's an eighth in it
New baby chop, let it sing, its a Drake nigga
A lot of shit on my mind make me think a lot
Why it's hard for me to smile? 'Cus I seen a lot
You ain't really in the field you just tweet a lot
If we ain't on the same page you can kick her out, bitch!

[Yhung T.O. (Kendrick Lamar):]
(And I been really tryna keep the peace)
But I'm a north Vallejo nigga and I'm heavy in the streets
I was raised by my grannie and the gansters
So at 8 I made the choice I'ma forever be a G, and
I don't really like to talk
I remember we was broke and I don't really like to walk, nigga
Now I ride around in foreign cars
And I put on for my team who was with me from the start, nigga
I don't play games, stitch lip, I don't say names
She want a dog I'm a great dame
I got great aim, Ice Age on my damn chain
My momma told me keep a stash for the damn rain
They ain't wanna see me win 'cus I'm black
So I pulled up in that all black Benz in the back
If you need someone to call I'm the man for the task
You ain't standing for the dogs meet the man in the mask


Vete al carajo y mamame la tota

Sky keep falling down
Falling down (Black Panther)
I keep falling down

Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like yah
Bad trips like "God!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us then we gon' be alright

[Hook - Pharrell Williams:]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down
What mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like
Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy
Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow
So my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-hook:]
When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga
When our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"
And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright

[Hook]

What you want, you a house you a car
40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal
Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all
Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all
I rap, I'm black, on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers


[Hook:]
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissinâ)
Sneak me through the back window, Iâm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

[Hook]

Dark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, Iâm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then wit told me, "You're womanless, woman love the creation"
It all came from God then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...

[Hook]

You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it

[Rapsody:]
Let me talk my Stu Scott, âscuse me on my 2pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die
Color of your skin, color of your eyes
Thatâs the real blues, baby, like you met Jayâs baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey
All my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkinâ my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
And forcinâ my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light donât mean you smart, beinâ dark donât make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ainât talkinâ âWoohah!â
Need a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored
Like two ties, L-L, you lose two times
If you donât see you beautiful in your complexion
It ainât complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, thatâs the context
Yeah, baby, Iâm conscious, ainât no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ainât no stress, jigga boos wanna be
I ainât talkinâ Jay, I ainât talkinâ Bey
Iâm talkinâ days we got school watchinâ movie screens
And spike yourself esteem
The new James Bond gonâ be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And itâs all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ainât a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that donât play fair, should I get out the car?
I donât see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell thatâs on earth


Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway, I need a baller ass, boss ass nigga
You'se a off brand ass nigga, everybody know it, your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?

This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made end's meet, eatin' your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes without a Mercedes Benz and twenty four inch rims, five percent tint, and air conditioning vents
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador, had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious, kept me up watchin'
Pornos and poverty, apology? No
Watch you volunteer it it while people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has it's day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter fact it need interest, matter fact it's nine inches
Matter fact see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin', my consensus
Been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is bullshit, porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is deaf, a state of decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I the picked cotton that made you rich
Now my dick ain't free

I'mma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king


What's wrong nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta?
I thought this what you wanted?
They say if you scared go to church
But remember
He knows the bible too

[Hook:]
My baby when I get you get you get you get you
Ima go head to ride with you
Smoking lokin' poking the deja till I'm idle with you
Cause I (want you)
Now baby when I'm riding here I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking lokin' drinking the potion you can see me swerving
Cause I (want you)
I want you more than you know

I remember you took me to the mall last week baby
You looked me in my eyes about 4 5 times
Till I was hypnotized then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said you crazy
Roses are red violets are blue but me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)

[Hook]

You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said where's Ricardo?
I said oh no, not the show
Than you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned 26 I was like oh shit
You said this to me
I remember what you said too you said
My name is Lucy Kendrick
You introduced me Kendrick
Usually I donât do this
But I see you and me Kendrick
Lucy Give you no worries
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers I came after when they was boring
Lucy gone fill your pockets
Lucy gone move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gone call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album truly
Lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paper work on top of paper work
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up then sign this contract if thatâs possible

[Hook]

I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home


K dot, pick up the phone, nigga. Every time I call, it's going to voice mail.
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga.
No socks and skinny jeans and shit. Call me on Shaniqua's phone

[Hook:]
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your home boy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
My lil homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where its at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them benjamin's go cuddle up
Skip, hop, trip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
Thats what the product smells like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

[Hook]

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called, they said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets donât fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, itâs set trippinâ all around
Ainât nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governinâ?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"

[Hook]

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappinâ
Motherfucker if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Yâall priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Donât ask about no camera back at award shows
No, donât ask about my bitch, no, donât ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
Iâm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
âK. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandoraâs boxâ
I box âem all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince my self the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting
A continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one


How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how Iâm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump 6, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear or two how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for 10 Rand [apprrox $1 USD], stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus - James Fauntleroy:]
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe

He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need
Tell me how much a dollar cost

[Chorus]

Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'mma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God"

[Ronald Isley:]
I wash my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, so right my wrongs


Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother

I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

(Crazy)
(What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

Huh (Walk my bare feet) huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) huh (fi-fie-fo-fum)
(I love myself) huh (My heart undone) one, two, three

And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, uhh

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it till I get it right
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body...

(Offstage Argument)
Not on my time, Not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music
Not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic- TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the question, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This, this year alone
Exactly. So we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain't shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dawg
On the dead homies. Charlie P, you know that bro
You know that
It's mando. Right, it's mando
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas bro
Exac- enough said, enough said
We gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen
Listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'm a dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; King royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: Black emperor, King, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'm a break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me
Or say no more. Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive


What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?

[Anna Wise:]
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me

Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

[Hook - Bilal:]
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass
Shit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga
Oh now, slow down

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

What I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg:]
And once upon a time in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service


I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again
(Aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga)
I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer
What the fuck happened?
(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say...

Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

You goat mouth mammy fucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton"
I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo
Ah yeah fuck the judge
I made it past 25 and there I was
A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king

Bitch where was you when I was walkin'-
[POP]
(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you)
[POP]
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta
Black man taking no losses
Bitch where was you when I was walkin'
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta)
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence


Oh shit!
Oh, I need that
I need that sloppy
That sloppy
Like a Chevy in quicksand
That sloppy

This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black (Pendleton) ball cap
(West, west, west)
We don't share the same synonym fall back
(West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis may be wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin' scratchin' dilligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home

[Hook:]
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you

I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's Ornery
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that lines from Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, donât gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much itâs worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didnât know shit
The day I came home

[Hook]

I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand me down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Runnin' home and the man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh I forgot don't kill my vibe, that's right you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was takin'
But never mind you're here right now don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I mean your life is full of turmoil
You spoiled by fantasies of who you are
I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off go catch a flight or two
But if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
Than be an advocate go tell your homies especially
To come back home

This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere

I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, AH!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
(Let's talk about love))
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, AH!
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is


The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
"I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga"

Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it
Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's
something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I
finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?

[2Pac:]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Right

[2Pac:]
That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see - and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich
people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm
saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you
know what I'm saying it's gonna be likeâ¦ there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha, they might eat the rich

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight
so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

[2Pac:]
I
see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of
the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where
I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made
myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time
to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions
for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now
I make millions for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

[2Pac:]
By
my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in "all good
things come to those that stay true." You know what I'm saying, and it
was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was
noticing, shit, I was
punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you
know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna
go straight through

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

[2Pac:]
Shit,
I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened
with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it
goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to
fight back

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight well, how long you think it
take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I
can't win and I wanna lay it all down

[2Pac:]
In this country a
black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and
that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause
once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man,
out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud
mouth 30-year old muthafuckas

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's crazy,
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I
can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

[2Pac:]
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I don't think America
know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be
some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be
murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's
crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of
energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

[2Pac:]
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:

"The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same."

What's your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac?
Pac?!


Everything black, I don't want black
I want everything black, I ain't need black
Some white some black, I ain't mean black
I want everything black
[x2]

Six in the mornin', fire in the street
Burn, baby burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie you made me
Black don't crack my nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelins, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook:]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook:]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the black, just remember that

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesyzing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalize manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
CAT scans on my radar bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you â no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with the Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Piru's, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street?
When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!


I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk [x6]

[Anna Wise:]
Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

[Hook - Bilal:]
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when Iâm in it, I love it when Iâm in it

If these walls could talk theyâd tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket Iâm not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? Iâm just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldnât stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when Iâm here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

[Hook]

If these walls could talk theyâd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down thatâs my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I donât know how long I can wait in these walls
Iâve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I mustâve missed them
Iâm not involved Iâd rather diss them
Iâd rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gonâ crush

[Hook]

If your walls could talk theyâd tell you itâs too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room


[10x:]
Loving you is complicated

I place blame on you still
Place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for?
Nigga, I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you're fuckin' failure, you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you, I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

[5x:]
Loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you too

House keeping
[Knocks]
House keeping
Â¡Abre la puerta! Â¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
Â¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuartoÂ¡
!Disculpe!

And you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTime'd the one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTime'd instead of a hospital visit
'Cause you thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed."
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speaking, nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and you're the reason, nigga
And if this bottle could talk [gulp] I cry myself to sleep
Bitch, everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you [gulp] I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say, "You gotta go."
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness


When the four corners of this cocoon collide
Youâll slip through the cracks hoping that youâll survive
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Hook:]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late night thinkin' of you
Until I got my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game, made a bad bitch yours
When I get signed homie I'mma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican, run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated but I got a million dollar check, like that

[Pre-Hook x2:]
We should never gave, we should never gave
Niggas money go back home, money go back home

[Hook]

[Dr. Dre:]
Yo what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker

What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam on your dollar
Motherfucker you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliche and say, fuck your haters
I can see the borrow in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies with a snow white collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me feel forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much and enough both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you get the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[George Clinton (Kendrick Lamar):]
Lookin' down is quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (When you're on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Pre-Hook]

Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'
Tax man comin'


Study long, study wrong, nigga
Hey, y'all close that front door, ya'll let flies in this motherfucker
Close that door!
My OG up in this motherfucker right now
My pops man with the bottle in his hand, actin' a fool
Hey, hey, babe check it out, Imma tell you what my mama had said, she like:

I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name

[Bridge:]
Askin', "where the hoes at?" to impress me
Askin', "where the moneybags?" to impress me
Say you got to burn your stash to impress me
It's all in your head, homie
Askin' "where the plug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where the juug at?" to impress me
Askin' "where it's at?" only upsets me
You sound like the feds, homie

[Hook x2:]
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie
You ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga
You ain't gotta try so hard

And the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you
But you think it's all love
And the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
Reputation can't protect you if you never had one
Jealousy (complex), emotional (complex)
Self-pity (complex), under oath (complex)
The loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
Let me put it back in proper context

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]

What do you got to offer?
Tell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit
Instead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie
This is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
So loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:

[Hook]


Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and vroom-vroom, I'm racing
Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees, ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screaming

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches 
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers

I've got twenty-five lighters on my dresser, yes sir
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wanting since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rolling, I'm holding my scrotum and posing
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in and

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's go time

It's go time, I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run at ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, I can feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time
Beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch, go play, beeotch
I look like OJ, killing everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbing in the street, yelling

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours

Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hanging with ya
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

I'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past ya
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourself you can remain, stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
I'mma break out and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me then put me on stages
To me that's amazing
To you that's a quick check, with all disrespect let me say this

I am a sinner
Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink I got my music I will share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air I can see you are - in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfucking much, I got my drink I got my music
I say, bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch don't kill my vibe

Aye, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get your freestyles ready!


[Intro]
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga you made it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
So I'm saying "What up what up. Nigga I hate it."
Frustrated and I'm riding down the back streets
Making my conscious ask me
"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly
Black boy fly
Black-black boy fly
Black boy fly

[Verse 1]
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym
We was living in sorrow
Total envy of him
He made a dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
His way out of Compton with further more to accomplish
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron
Now watch that black boy fly

[Hook]
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly
Watch that black boy fly
Black boy...

[Verse 2]
I used to jealous of Jayceon
I used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
Its 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game they line in front of the store
Swap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities
Chillin my conscience next to a villain
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
A Boy touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
Only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
When 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
I was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...
Out of Compton

Thank God...
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly


[Intro]
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Tryna reach you everyday, collect calls
Never get through, and I go through with drawls
Say who told you that I wanted this the
I just wanted to vent or
Ask you if you give me your rent for
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yea every record, shows
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
K Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Wish you prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left in the dark, blind
Mama kiss the back of me this last time

[Hook]
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Men lie, Women lie
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Mama take this motherfucking block off
Thats the date the state will take the blocks off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
Please believe me, This ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
Remember when you put me in that relay run
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had told me that the very day I won
All I need is you to give me some support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them god damn numbers
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I tell if I stress take the block off
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection tell me who you see
Who is your protection, G-O-D
No its not neglection, I have just accepted
Your fate and what its gon' be
Remember all the nights that I cried
Thinking that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, Kicking through the door
It's you they looking for, Raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand, and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this

[Hook]


[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 1]
Now everybody serenade the new fate of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it
My point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics woulda told you Kendrick got killed and pretend its a massacre
And the masses upon us
And I master being the the master at dodging your honour
And the chapter that read at 25, I will live dormant like 5 in the morning
Then raid your spot while Kendrickâs performing
And if they take everything know I gotâ¦

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

(Hey Dre whats happening with it my nigga)

[Dr Dre - Verse 2]
Still Iâm at it, peel the plastic off it
You could feel the magic
Still Iâm laughing at the critics talking
I can see âem gagging when Iâm back in the back of my city
Back in the back with a batch, Iâm banging Dre Beats with me
Look where Iâm at, itâs the murder capâ
And Iâm captain at birth of this gangsta rap
Itâs a wrap when Iâm done
And Iâve come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mill in a day
Bitch Iâm from..

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 3]
So come and visit, the tires screeching
Ambulance, policeman
Wonât you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Khaki crease and crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where your sword at?
Hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big, itâs Rasputia for you shooters
Kama sutra screaming fuck your position and make you hold that
Iâm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know Flex and piru crip tatts

They swarm on me like a beehive hoop in the G ride
From the west to the east side
Know just how Compton roll

[Dr Dre & Kendrick Lamar]
And thatâs a given
I pass the blunt then pass the torch
Of course itâs my decision
I crashed the ports that you report
That you see me in Benzes
I must report that we import them narcotics

You bought it then talked about it when crack hit the speakers
The music business
I blow up every time we throw up a record depending on what you expected
Iâm sure itâs bigger than your religion
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

[Hook]
Compton, compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Dr Dre]
So tell that gangsta throw his set high
Roll it up in a blunt, Iâmma take you on that next high
I did exactly what I wanted, thatâs what made them checks flyâ¦
In my direction, you never question when I said Iâ¦
Will be a mogul before I visit Tupac and Left Eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see ya we gon test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now Iâm on a red eye
Flying back to my city cause I forever stand byâ¦

[Hook]
Compton, Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now we can all celebrate, we can all harvest the rap artist of NWA
America target a rap market, itâs controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in, made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich and the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers that know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, 10 bottles of Rose
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every muthafucka in here say

Look who responsible for taking Compton international
I make âem holla oooooooh

Eh yo Just Blaze, good looking homie
(Just Blaze, just blaze)

Ain't no city quite like mine


[Intro]
Greetings boys and girls
(Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P. 
(My name is Petey P.)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (that's right, that's right, that's right)
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I'd like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)
Your pop guns (and sing) and fireworks and sing along

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Sing along kids, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

(Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...)

I've been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at 95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
we was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers to move
With nothing else to lose but a burger flippin' job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine this a mansion
Gold ballroom AK-47 dancing
Howling at the moon was a pack of hungry babies
Hope you feed 'em soon bite your back you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table of Sizzlers
But never made that visit, if better days was on its way
Then it made the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
(Oh yeah I remember that, it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Am I right?)
Spend it all in front of the county building (oh)
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah

And all the ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up
Ghetto children in the world say that's my car
All the ghetto boys say that's my car
All the ghetto girls say that's my car
When we grow up, when we grow up

(Nig-nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?)

Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (uh huh)
Played the passenger I think it's five years after eighty-
seven do the math ' 92 don't you be lazy (I won't)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
of a block party that stop for a second then it rekindle
Like a flame from a trick candle everybody got dental
Insurance 'cause we 'bout to floss
you get that couch I sent you?
I heard that from a block away probably had credentials
of a scholar but shit not today
them Dayton spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi I want them ten woo-woofers
Say that you got me if not I'll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bull's eye like Tauruses
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it if we run out?
He said lil nigga today the poor is rich
Don't tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don't forget
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't neither
Niggas gon' snitch watch the company you keeping
And one day you'll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots
(That's right the mothafuckin' Rodney King
you just put your daddy on Bullis Rd.)

[Chorus]
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (that's crazy)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah
(Don't forget still sing along kids, still sing along)
When we grow up we gon' go and get us a million (Please sing)
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane yeah


[Hook: Pharrell]
Mass hallucination baby
Ill education baby
Want to reconnect with your relations
This is your station baby

[Verse 1]
Look inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire
To fire bullets that stray
Track a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir what do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith
As the record spin I should pray
For the record I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity building
It's probably big as a building
Me jumping off of the roof
Is just me playing it safe
But what am I supposed to do
When the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to
Just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place
They was wondering if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind because one day you respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All I see is strobe lights
Blinding me in my hindsight
Finding me by myself
Promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic
And finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference
? or cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning
I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose
To persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I supposed to do
With the blinking of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof
And your dog has to say proof
And you ask "lift up your shirt"
Cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter: "He's probably young but I know that he's down"
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
He don't mind, he know we never respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I see in this room
20 Xanies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain
Can we live in the same society
It's entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim
I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm
Inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room
With 20 Xanies and 'shrooms
Some grown-up candy I lost it
I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, cause now you ever in debt
To good kid, m.A.A.d. city

[Hook]


[Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolBoy Q:]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!

"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window â check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Kendrick Lamar + ScHoolBoy Q:]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hearâ
YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!


[MC Eiht:]
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[MC Eiht:]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what!

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you with it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on

Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs

You looking like a easy come-up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah

A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 at the school
(we at the school)
You know, âBig Ballin' With My Homiesâ
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational

Back to reality we poor, ya bish
Another casualty at war, ya bish
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head
He said one day I'd be on tour, ya bish

That Louies Burger never be the same
(won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerkin'
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirtin'

Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of 'em offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might, turn to a million and we all rich that's just how I feel

[Anna Wise 2x:]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes, when they on patrol? No way

[Jay Rock:]
Imagine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings,
Liquor spilling pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping,
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga,
I just hope the Lord forgive him

Pots with cocaine residue,
Every day I'm hustling
What else is a thug to do
When you eat cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em,
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch

Drop that work up in the bushes,
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do tell the truth,
This the last time you might see my ass

From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
Them serpents lurking blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas
Selling drugs but it's all good

Broken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you do
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)

And I been hustlin' all day,
This a way, that a way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

[K's Mom:] Kendrick, just bring my car back, man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways.
Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house, man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a motherfucker.
Shit, I'm tryna get my thing going, too. Just bring my car back.
Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him!

[K's Dad:] Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, girl, I want your body, I want your body, 'cause of that big ol' fat ass.

[K's Mom:] See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain't even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!

[K's Dad:] Did somebody say dominoes?


[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
We on?
Aight
1, 2, 3, go!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Waking up in a dream
Sleepwalking on another big stage
You never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
Your name and your song, I'm so far away
From the place I used to be, struggling usually
Look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
I can feel the energy in the air
It feel like I'm supposed to be here

[Bridge 1: Mary J. Blige]
Everywhere I go I'm getting so much love
Fans, the stars, everyone
Sayin how they can't wait for the LP
And I'm gonna blow
They believe in me
Feel so good in what you do
Helps somebody else get through
That's why I do the best I can
Because I know how blessed I am

[Hook:]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
A fool if I take it all for granted
A smart man if I keep my feet planted
To the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it
You speakin' outlandish
I'm a show you how to make it all work
Another plan, it a short term goal for me
A record sold for me
It's just more of me in your ear
For you to hear Kendrick persevere
Defenses I feel relentless
Ambition with a clear vision
Takin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons
I'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance
Came across me, how much it'a cost me
To get you out my business
I set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit
I'm past that, now pass that
Award, not one but four
Times two plus yours

[Bridge 2: Mary J. Blige]
I see myself performing there, (K.dot)
Sold out shows where the room is packed
Sitting at the Grammy's winning five awards
See myself on big billboards
Traveling around the world with endorsement deals
Can't imagine how it feels
That's why I'm smiling everyday
Because my dream ain't far away

[Hook:]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed
Calculated my steps, my heart, my breath
Breathe hums? of a victory and vividly
You see me when at my best, my worst
This verse dedicated to the days that I slept
With a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed
I burst in the crowd with a voice and crown
I'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?
And I vow on the tape that I'll never break
You can break bread with me now
We can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal
Then scream out loud that we made it off the avenue
And walked that mile
In the darkness I often sit back
And get lost in the rap that I wrote
When you told me that it spoke to your soul
I was talking to you
I was walking it through every ghetto
Tell success hello
We here

[Bridge 3: Mary J. Blige]
And I'm so happy I cry
Cause I can't believe
All the things I ever wanted
Are finally happening for me
And it's so surreal
That I almost feel
That any minute I can wake up
From this fantasy
When you pray so hard
And you've come so far
And you know that it's the time for you lift your bar
And I'm gonna do it
Watch me!

[Hook: x2]
I'm so high I can touch the sky
I know it's my time
And it's now or never
Shine so bright, I light the night
And it feels so right, ain't nothing better


[Intro - Kendrick Lamar:]
Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar:]
I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2 - Drake:]
I really hope you play this, 'cause ol' girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 3 - Kendrick Lamar:]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

[Hook - Kendrick Lamar:]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Skit:]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, OK? You gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker homie"


[Hook:]
I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I...
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real [x4]

[Verse 1:]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you love me
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and their present is old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word "but", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

[Skit 1:]
"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie". "Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga". "Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga"

[Hook]

[Skit 2:]
"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom."

"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do."

[Bridge:]
Sing my song, it's all for you [x16]

[Skit 2 Continued:]
"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye."

[Sound of a cassette tape being stopped and fast forwarded.]


Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome."
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"Cool, where you stay?"
She said: "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" â "No," she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you tryin' to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fiffteen minutes!
I gotta go to the county buildin, man
These kids ready to eat! Iâm ready to eat, shit
I gotta get them food stamps, come on now
You on you way or what?
I hope you ainât out there messin' with them damn hood-rats out there, shit, especially that crazy-ass girl Sherane
Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ainât gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)
Kenny! (What?) You on his voicemail! Damn fool (Oh) Shit!
(K, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I ask you to bring my fuckin' dominoes!)
Kenny, give me the damn phone, shit. Donât hang up! Damn!
(Keep losin' my damn dominoes, we gon' have to go in the backyard and squab, homie)
Just let meâ Kendrick
When you get this message, man, call me back
I need to know when you gon' bring back my damn car
This man fussin' about some damn dominoes
It ainât all that serious, fuck, damn dominoes
Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!
Fuck them damn dominoes, nobody wanna hear that
(Nobody wanna hear yo' ass!
Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
You killin' my motherfuckin' vibe)


[Sing About Me]

[Intro:]
When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1:]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind
I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright
And a fight he tried to put up, but the type
Of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands
My plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, "Get em"
I got em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover
A passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n
In pajamas and Dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child
I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever
And I love you cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop I hope -

[Hook:]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2:]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby
What's crazy was, I was hearin about it
But doubted your ignorance, how could you ever
Just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit
Well it's completely my future
A nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys
Matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader
You need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her
That's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted
But fuck that "Sorry for your loss shit"
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away
I know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake
I'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...

[Hook:]
When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3:]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself
Am I really scared of passing away
If it's today I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Rake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon
And if I'm doomed, may the wound
Help me mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about
Cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that put me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "it need to be told
Cursing the life of 20 generations after her soul"
Exactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Now am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

[Hook:]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Skit]

[I'm Dying of Thirst]

Tired of running
Tired of hunting
My own kind
But retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Dope on the corner
Look at the coroner
Daughter is dead
Mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently
But they couldn't, bring her back
Who got the footage? channel 9
Cameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy
When you know you're crooked
Banana clip split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

How many sins?
I'm running out
How many sins?
I lost count
Dreams of ballin like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling
I'm cottonmouth
Money is power, yours is ours
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song
A black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst
Dye your thirst

What are we doing?
Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is humming
Tell us to visit, we lying about coming
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding
And the beef is bubbling
It's no discussion, hereditary
All of my cousins
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst
Dying of thirst

Too many sins
I'm running out
Somebody send
Me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted
Granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, I stress days
Say "Fuck the world, " my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling, tired of running
I'm tired of tumbling
Backwards my mama say
"See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst
You dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"

[Skit/Outro]


[Intro: Ab-Soul]
Playas always trying to pop bottles
Niggas love to pop bottles
Then get you a table, my nigga, get you a table, my nigga...

[Interlude]
Pour up, drank, head shot, drank
Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
Faded, drank, faded, drank

[Jay Rock]
No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
One life, that's all we have, OK lets toast to that
Then dive in a pool full of liquor, swim laps like Michael Phelps

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga why you babysittin only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

[Interlude]

[Ab-Soul]
Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
With it we all trippin off the hen like a female chicken
You with it? (Soul!) Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car
Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Schoolboy Q]
So it's that groovy little nigga known for popping them bottles
Under my pants be a golden dick, bitch, everything about me solid
Burberry nigga, them be my draws, Alexander McQueen in closets
Swagged-out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh, have that pussy throbbin'
Someone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that, twisted off them molly caps
Ciroc too don't fuck wit Goose; can I get a shot, swim in your juice?
Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet - bitch, did you see your tab reciept?

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

âSherane?â
(Pool full of liqour then you dive in, in, in, in [reversed])
âSherane, Sherane, Sheraneâ (Wa-Watch em all f-flock)
"Awww man"
âSheraneâ (Girls wanna play, play, play)
Where is she taking me? (P-Pool full of liquor imma d-d-i-iive in)
Where is she, takingâ¦ me

[Kendrick Lamar]
All I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep
And never ever wake up; never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
More, more, bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, moooore
...Bless me more
We gon drink this mothafucka down, more
Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
Fill it up more, not enough, more [3X]


Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Back stroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room
Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me
Then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now
And I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down
I'mma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe
I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize
This is parental advice
Then apparently, I'm over-influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it

Pour up (drank), head shot (drank)
Sit down (drank), stand up (drank)
Pass out (drank), wake up (drank)
Faded (drank), faded (drank)

[Bridge:]
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang
I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang
Hop out. Do you, bang
Two chopper, two hundred shots, bang

Nigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody sit your bitch ass down and listen
To this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans
Ya bish

Smoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye
Drank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now
And we ain't asking for no favors
Rush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye
Really I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now
And momma used to say
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you out, out
One day, it's gon' burn you out
One day, it's gon' burn you
But I'm with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
âCause the energy we bringing sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate
If itâs necessary
Bumping Jeezy first album looking distracted
Speaking language only we know, you think is an accent
The windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses
Of the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls
And asked them what they working with â look at me
I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually Iâm drug-free, but shit Iâm with the homies

(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red
Come through and bust ya head nigga)
Me and the homies
(Sag all the way to the liquor store
Where my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)
Me and the homies
(I ride for my mothafuckinâ niggas
Hop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)
Me and the homies
(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like
âDoo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!â)

Itâs 2:30 and the sun is beaming
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming
Hungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me
Iâll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating
We speeding on the 405 passing Westchester
You know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord
They knew we werenât from âround there
âCause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didnât like then started interrogating
I never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither
I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
Thatâs ironic âcause Iâve never been violent, until Iâm with the homies

(Just ridinâ, just ridinâ)
Me and the homies
(Bullshittinâ, actinâ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippinâ, really trippinâ)
Me and the homies
(Just ridinâ, just ridinâ, just ridinâ...)

Bragging âbout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessey didnât make me feel that bad
Iâm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt you
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ainât got the CD in
But Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still ânigga, what is you sayingâ
Pull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months
The sun is going down as we take whatever we want
(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe
Ay nigga, I think it's somebody in this room
Wait, what?
Nigga, it's somebody in this room!)
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circling life
My mama called â "Hello? What you doin'?" âKicking itâ
I shouldâve told her Iâm probably âbout to catch my first offense with the homies

But they made a right, they made a left then made a right
Then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though
Ooh, which one?
Well which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain't hit that
Nah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans
Nigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?
"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!"
Yea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go
Look, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi.
Wait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park,
cause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight
That's what heâs not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too
Nigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight
Matter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active

[BÄkon:]
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I was takin' a walk the other day, and I seen a woman-a blind woman-pacin' up and down the sidewalk. She seemed to be a bit frustrated, as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it. So after watchin' her struggle for a while, I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know? "Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance? It seems to me that you have lost something. I would like to help you find it." She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something. You've lost... your life."

[Gunshot]

[BÄkon:]
Is it wickedness?

Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song, quote: "And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'..."
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it.


I got, I got, I got, I got
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow, inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this
Immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this
Was Yeshua's new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome, heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a-
Bitch, your hormones probably switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy probably snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through probably offend you
This is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids
And I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier's DNA
Born inside the beast
My expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on-sale motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I'm supposed to
Antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that's a riff, gonna plead this case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows, I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder-these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder-our DNA

[Video outro:]
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja
DNA
Gimme some ganja
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA
Drippin' gold inside my DNA
Power shows inside my DNA
DNA
Gimme some ganja, gimme some ganja
Real nigga in my DNA
Ain't no ho inside my DNA


[BÄkon and Kid Capri:]
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
We gon' put it in reverse

[Ted Taylor:]
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my...

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

[Reversed Audio:]
So, I was takin' a walk the other dayâ¦


[Kid Capri:]
New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go

[Kendrick Lamar:]

Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, I know, yeah
100K spread 'cross the floor, 'cross the floor yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow yeah, the flow yeah
Years in the makin' and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' 'bout races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at their laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mister one through five that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

Damned if I do, if I don't, ya
Goddamn us all if you won't, ya
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't frontline, get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought they weren't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in LA for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real
Most of y'all go squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes
Most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade
Most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artist
But it's a difference 'tween black artist and wack artist

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'mma make it look sexy

[Kid Capri:]
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

[Kendrick Lamar:]
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'mma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element


[Carl Duckworth:]
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What's up, family? Yeah, it's yo cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man. I know you been havin' a lot on yo mind lately, and I know you feel like, you know, people ain't been prayin' for you. But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28: 28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart." See, family, that's why you feel like you feel like you got a chip on your shoulder. Until you finally get the memo, you will always feel that way...

[Charles Edward Sydney Isom Jr.]
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won't you burn this muh'fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(Reversed)

I beat yo ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo ass, lil nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got beaucoup payments to make
County building's on my ass
Tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo ass if I beat yo ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I'll prolly die anonymous
I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers
Are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna diffuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucka up
And then I'd take two puffs
I've been hungry all my life
I'm high now, I'm high now
I'm high now, I'm high now
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
Now...

When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out
And just kill somethin', drill somethin'
Get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal
If my reputation would miss me
What they see from me
Would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me
Would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me
So hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap

[BÄkon:]
Damn
Goddamn you
Goddamn me
Goddamn us
Goddamn we
Goddamn us all

[Carl Duckworth:]
Verse two says you only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities. So until we come back to these commandments, until you come back to these commandments, we're gonna feel this way, we're gonna be under this curse. Because he said he's gonna punish us, the so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel. We are the Israelites according to the Bible. The children of Israel, he's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience, because we chose to follow other gods that aren't his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee. So, just like you chasten your own son, he's gonna chastise you because he loves you. So that's why we get chastised, that's why we're in the position we're in. Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments, and do what the Lord said, these curses are gonna be upon us. We're gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live here in today, in the United States of America. I love you, son, and I pray for you. God bless you, shalom.


[Kendrick Lamar & Chelsea Blythe:]
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me

I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like-

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin'

I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debating on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'mma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music, though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
I feel like say somethin', I feel like take somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?

Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'


This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

Ever since a young man
All I wanted to be was a gunman
Shootin' up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin' plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Look, lookâ¦ hol' up!
Don't judge me, my mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me, I was young, fuckin' all the rats
Don't judge me, aimin' at your head for a stack
Donât judge! Don't judge me!
Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me, if I press your line you a freak
Don't judge me, won't you tell a friend y'all gon' see

This what God feel like, huh, yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, yeah (a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)

Fuck is you talkin' to?
Aye, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel

I don't rush shit, fuck shit
Always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit
Morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit
Levitate, duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous

This what God feel like
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha! 
(This what God feel like)
Huh, yeah (this what God feel like)
This what God feel like


[Music video version:] Wicked or weakness, you gotta see this, waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
[Regular version:] Nobody pray for me, it been that day for me, waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)

Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits

Parmesan where my accountant lives in fact I'm down at this
D'usÅe with my boo bae, tastes like kool aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down we playing Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M. funk
Piss out your per diem you just gotta hate em, funk
If I quit your BM I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil baby in a spiral

Feelin' like Tyson with it

Only for the night, I'm kiddin'
Only for life, you're a homie for life
You're a homie for life, let's get it

Told you that I'm on the way

Pick up the phone for me, babe

Bad attitude from your nanny
Curves and your hips from your mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yep

All I want tonight is just get high up (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (on fire)

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust
(All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)

[Rihanna:]
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, deeper now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established
Hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I'm a natural, I'm alright

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I'm a king
Shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, shimmy-yeah, rock (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honesty forever, all a real nigga want

I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)

Feel somethin' wrong
(You actin' shifty, you don't ride)
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

[Rihanna:]
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to

[Kendrick Lamar & Rihanna:]
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's what God for

[DJ Dahi:]
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (fired, fire)

Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby


[Kendrick Lamar:]
I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'-

Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
[Kendrick Lamar:]
This that new shit
This that new, new shit

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you-

Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count
(I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin'
Thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make him pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

She said, "It's okay."

I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings I did-what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it's 11: 30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feeling's deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin', things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways; Lust

Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been hidin' (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4: 4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

I need some water
Somethin' came over me
Way too high to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay
She said, "It's okay."

Love's gonna get you killed
But pride's gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and-

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart
You love 'em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in the perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in men
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make amend
I understand I ain't perfect
I probably won't come around
This time, I might put you down
Last time, I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I'm willing to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
Pity parties and functions and you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
I can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

[Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise:]
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there
Maybe I wasn't there

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December, but never remember what Winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world

[Steve Lacy (Kendrick Lamar):]
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(In another life, I surely was there)
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
(I care, I care)

Maybe I wasn't there

[Kid Capri:] New Kung Fu Kenny

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Throw a steak off the ark
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
X-rated

Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosphin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure
Hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch

I'll wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my mama
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother

You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention
Call you back-

Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
(Pray for me) Damn!

[Bono:]
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag
Is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us!
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets
Wall Street, corporate offices
Banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to blood?
I'll ask again-oops-accident
It's nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

[Bono:]
It's not a place
This country is to be a sound of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar-


[Kid Capri:]
New shit, new Kung Fu Kenny

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I got so many theories and suspicions
I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close-get money, fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My mama told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read-

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion
I'm a Israelite, don't call me Black no mo'
That word is only a color, it ain't facts no mo'
My cousin called, my cousin Carl Duckworth
Said know my worth
And Deuteronomy say that we all been cursed
I know he walks the Earth
But it's money to get, bitches to hit, yah
Zeroes to flip, temptation is, yah
First on my list, I can't resist, yah
Everyone together now, know that we forever-

Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah
Buzzin', radars is buzzin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, yah


[Verse 1:]
Gimme that beat, fool
This a full time jack, no really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it when you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag and the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from livin' large
Matter fact, where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one I'm on one I'll make sure your kids breathe ammonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart from the blood niggas fuckin' with me crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate, it's a legitimate reason why I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch The Sky"
But I'll be looking passed that I'm tryna touch god
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Ya'll married to the game well I'm bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you goin' through something, this is shit you recite
This is bigger than life
This is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tall [?] I mean war like that
Yeah, straight like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
In 2010 I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate
Shall stay anonymous
Searchin' 7 continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies-homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga
My nigga Tony said "just do you, nigga!"
Sure improve, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure till they know you got the stankiest stew, nigga!
I ain't trippin' I'm just tippin' on fo-fo's back in the city and tippin' on 4 hoes
That boy got a cold cold
He's sick con, slick on
Drop red jewels like a school bar mitzvah
Ooooh
Straight like that

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Why ya'll complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop not Dre not Ice Cube
I don't care me and quik went to the same school
I look at the mirror and do it myself like a self made nigga
I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a cosign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger, but do I need em though?
I just made a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost "Me Against The World" on you motherfuckers
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
I look at your Audemars to put ya'll in time out
It's time to unveil the real and your careers bout as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute brother [?] and pull the wine out
Oooh, just like that

[Hook]


[Intro: Napoleon Hill]
"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
because it will reveal to you why it is true
that whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve
regardless of how many times you have failed in the past
or how lofty your aims and hopes may be"

[Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Take your time, it'll come
Just stay focussed and humble my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and blasting?
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area, or carry the birds to the gate
Let the clips distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald that is

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
And when I do it, I do it again, then I go back
When I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back
Thug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out
I gotta grind, grind

[Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife
Pop's engine in this old school run tight!
But as you listening to K. D-O-T
Me and my girl split the bucket at KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say
Damn, these niggas that much better than me?
Baby, I don't think this is meant to be
cause I'm always losing self-esteem
She paused the iPhone, then said huh
I repeated what I said, then she replied shut up
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones
Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success
I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar - over chorus]
Yeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man
I wanna live good
Just wanna make my momma proud, y'know?
I don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes
I got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga
I just want it, I just want it
and I'ma get it


[Kendrick Lamar]
Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?
He say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
But shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

[Chorus: BJ the Chicago Kid]
What am I gonna do? Gotta have faith
Life is too much, understood? Where is your faith?
Oh, faaaaaaaith...
All you need is the size of a mustard seed

[Kendrick Lamar]
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
Spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
Then lost her faith again

[Chorus]

[Punch]
Kendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga
This about how faith works, yeah, murk it... 
I had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
It's jungle when the niggas ensue
The rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
I flirted with the idea of caressing the steel
to make karma come faster than she normally will
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout
But it never rain in California 'less them pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Ray Charles voice

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
But whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
and wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
than die and find out there really is, think about it


[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
But I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
What? Uh

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here

[Kendrick Lamar - singing]
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Schoolboy Q]
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
instead of problem solving
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
as I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Nothing is surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar

[Chorus 2]


See y'all don't understand me
My plan be is to win y'all hearts before I win a Grammy
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
marching on Rosecrans in Compton
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I'm on point like period
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
the way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci manhood
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am


[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I used to to wanna by like Michael Jordan
Figured that I'd hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
5-0-1s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
that every Section 8 tenant is familiar with? Ooh wee
They say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87
With a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A billion bucks, and that's why

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this

[Kendrick Lamar]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe
Uh, so give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You niggas' check's cash
And I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off rap
Ay, that lil' nigga got it going on
G5, going-going-going gone
Cloud nine mind state
I drop a record, then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y

[Chorus 2]

[Jay Rock]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
Say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
Aooow~! First off, I'm a rider bitch
Put them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Okay, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga
When I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga

[Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this


[Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar)]
Sit still and close your eyes (smoke to it)
What's behind the other door? Oh-ohh
No more silence (no more silence)
Don't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)
Just searching for the perfect shot

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey)]
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
When y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
My conscience only knew what's half-tight
At 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga
This is a dog's fight my nigga
The soundtrack to life my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
He sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Punk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back
Ball dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack
That's because these Compton streets was built not to win
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Part of me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)
The good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some
Where is the love?

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey (Kendrick Lamar)]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar (Angela McCluskey)]
Give me rings, give me chains mayne
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Then give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a
G5, clear port, say hello to the man
Give me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud
my name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
With that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people would kill for
Manhattan at 40/40, no forties but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar
This is me, and that's love

[Chorus: Angela McCluskey]
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now everybody smoke to it
for this is, the celebration


We on Ali? You ugly
Everybody just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up

[Chorus]
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me, hmm
That's the only way I know
(That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)

Uh, I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
but I can outsmart any high IQ
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
And California on that jerk shit
But I'd just rather two-step like my first steps
Jill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes

[Chorus]

And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
Stale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killers man, people who killed man
But my character never could be like them man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film man?
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh

[Chorus]

Almost lost my life to the industry
Had to look through a photo book to remember me
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killers, chasing hits
Lying to yourself all over an image
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My mama said, boy that don't sound like you
I said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
The reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
See I give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

[Chorus]

[uncredited female]
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Is this really you? Is this who you are?
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?

I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I just wanna be higher than that
I used to want to be the messiah of rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
That means I'll be fronting, hmm
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all I could say is, will the radio care?
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
Twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn soon as my record spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focussed, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
And that means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word (righteous)
Mm, yeah
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focussed, one word

[uncredited female]
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word
Too focussed, one word
Too focussed, too focussed, one word


[Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?
Well alright

[Chorus x2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm going through something with life
Where pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron make you feel alright
Pussy and Patron, that's some great advice

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association, story of my life nigga!
You gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!
Pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
Maintaining my modest-modest as I dream
So while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
Life itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry

[Chorus x2]

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
Surrounded by the irony of living in the city
I said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat
And the only thing can help is ass and some titties
So what's up baby? I said what's up?
I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
See I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
Capital One popping up on my caller I.D.
Pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots
Watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
Man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?
You know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
Or run through a pothole at two in the morning
Scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it
See I know, when the harsh reality takes toll
Open up your contacts, then scroll ("hey what's up daddy? ")

[Chorus x2]

[Ab-Soul:]
Welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve
Cutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd
Like a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck
Convertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh'
I feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver
So I took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!)
My sky's gray, my bitch is brighter
Always saying "Lights Please", J. Cole's her ghostwriter
And I'm the God MC, join my diocese
Free ya mind, don't mind so-ciety
And finally, everyone got their own problems
Everything's subject to change like broken dollars
I'm a, drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina
Like a Pirahna fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when

[Chorus x2]


[Kendrick Lamar]
One time
Reporting live, Compton, California

She go to work, she go to school
Her body smooth, no tattoos
Type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
My pops love her too, she's compatible
She's independent, she handle her business
She believe in God and no other religions
Never in competition when it comes to her friends
She's dependable, she set her own trends
A confidant, a mediator
So sweet, every flavor
Just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
Look at her hips, I want to be her pager
Conservative, affirmative
Action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
The beauty of her, a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
The beauty of her, swear to God a blind man could see
A true queen, and she needs me

[Chorus: Javonte]
That girl is smoking
and can you believe that I'm her focus?
It ain't hard to see she got me open
and together, we are roller-coasting, on, on, on

[Kendrick Lamar]
Five years later, an accounting major
Work at a firm, abundance of paper
She got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a Mercedes that she can steer
Private bars, executive meetings
Consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
Dior reeking through her Prada dress
Probably the only product of a pure success
Got a promotion, now she own the building
Headed to the top like she on the building
Real estate, property
She do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
Funded a youth center, invested in some stock
Doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
Oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
We lose touch, separated
Years pass, I'm out dating
She's dating, one of Hollywood's
famous of entertainers, Denzel good
Paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
Tuesday morning brunch, Benihana's
Tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
Headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
Emmy Awards, Academy too
On the red carpet, dress matching his suit
She holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
Head in the clouds, star-gazing
Caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
He bent down, got on one knee
She looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
She needs me, she needs me
Even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
I need her... we need we

[Chorus]


[Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live, from Compton, California
North Cackalack

Now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
You're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
My itinerary is very hectic
I break records on every record, I'm truly reckless
Kendrick Lamar, know how to maul with my wrist
Shout to writers for holding it down bitch
Me and my down bitch, get busy
I'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
My drive is not to be chauffeured
I'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
Boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, I've done situated myself, I ain't lying
Be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
The good kid from the mad city
Holding a cereal box instead of a Glock
In a 1992 Caddilac that I got from my pops
Transmission slipping, but I ain't tripping, swallow my pride
Pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like Stacie homie when airing out endo
I wish a nigga would

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
A yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
Big Pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yo, it's evident, I'm evidently your favorite
All I ask, open your ears and please savor it
The taste is un-acquired, quietly, been inspired
I'm at a point in my life when I was getting tired
Now I'm brushing off the dust
We don't need no water, fire burned it to the dust
Nigga grind hard, roaches turning into musk
People hear his pain, I consider that a plus
I'm a grown man, so a few I have trust to Do the Right Thing
The Spike thing, consider me the in-between
The new regime taking over
Either we each other's opposition or you soldier
Used to have the whole state of NC on my shoulder then I passed it
off to the next, you unlucky bastard
I'm getting drunk same time every year
to celebrate the life, Rosie no longer here
I swear

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Me and Big Pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
Even zoos can beat up from punchlines
When I kick it and pump mine, I've got to be a prophet
I've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
I'm a Hub City representer, so I've got to represent the
city like a District Attorney being the case for killers
Might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since I had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers 

[Rapper Big Pooh]
U-P-S, I (deliver)
Little brown boy get the pick of the litter
No glitter, all guts, no glory
Station on repeat, they retread the same story
New niggas bore me, tryna progress to that old shit
Have a plate, that food for your soul tip
Drill it in your head, youngun it's that real Hip-
Hop along 'fore you get your little ass whipped

[Chorus]


"Boarding completed
I'd like to welcome you aboard flight number F2B3
Our scheduled flying time will be four hours and twenty minutes
and we will be cruising at an altitude of thirty-three-thousand feet
At this time we would like to acquaint you with some of the features
Relax and breathe normally"

Uh, coming down like I'm uphill
Hogging both lanes better than a bus will
She tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
But it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
I mix a little bit of Kendrick with some L.A. weather
then step out like Chicago in its finest era
You niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
Downgrading yourself, you get an F for effort
Ha-ha, I let the world know
I chose to keep to myself and let the world go
And if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
So she can be curious on Twitter looking me up
I'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
Ass so fat that it tipped over the Aston
Speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
Hello to my wittiness, I'm Cadillac's grandson

[Chorus]
And I'm a trip
Ever since an understudy man I've always been a trip
Mama tell me that she love me but she know her son a trip
Baby open up your ears, you ain't heard it like this
Sounwave drop the beat, I lock the flow down
Now all the way to the moon we bout to go now
I got enough of the mojo to go around
So pack your bags and tell him you going out of town
cause I'm a trip

Landing on another runway, fly with me
or die tryna fly, a shot-down Frisbee
Shout out to Black Hippy, nigga we on
like we never been off, straight shots of Patron
I'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
Pussy ain't shit, I can give y'all some bitches
Clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
then wear off the Kangols, hood rats, I hate those
And she know what this is, hey lil' mama
Seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
But why you always in somebody face lil' mama?
Embarrassing yourself, get off the stage (Lil Mama)
Nigga, I gotta be that nigga
If I ain't, I gotta be that nigga
Curtesy of Paula's oldest son, pay homage
or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

[Chorus]

Gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
That's how I get at 'em when I look at a shoe rack
Penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
So I can live on a hill just off a few raps
I want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
That might be outer space, the Jupiter district
I quadruple my vision
If you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
I've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
on some Compton shit
Somebody that'll ride or die, that's a Compton bitch
You see my city is the city of Lamar
It'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
The swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
The tree for the low, don't you know, Paul Bunyan
I'm on cloud nine, I can see rain coming
So if I'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

[Chorus]

"How was your flight Mr. Lamar?
Good, hope to see you next time"


[Kendrick Lamar]
I was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper
A letter in reply, seven days later
after I wrote him "stay strong, keep your faith in God"
what I told him, hoping that he's listening
Said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
What a coincidence, I was bumping some Plies
I can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
I know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
Doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
Your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
Sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks
Ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks
And you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
As I read every word that you write, I can only imagine
Jason Keaton, I can only imagine, yeah

[Chorus: Javonte]
Life's about decisions man
It's in your hand and you got it
Just take control if you can
It's in your hand and you got it

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, that was my Uncle Bobby
after he just got out, fifteen years to count
Haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
Trying to get his life together, or whatnot
Typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
Got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
Found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce
Then he found God, then he bounced
Then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips
Found something in her we didn't see
Found this spot in Pasadena and shacked with her, an investment
Then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
Violence on my Uncle, was working with two strikes
Only out a year, now facing life, I can only imagine
That's fucked up, I can only imagine, Uncle Bob

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Sitting on the couch, thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence
with no parole, the state won't oversee
They make the term severe, a conspiracy
That's what I call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick
The government help? No, just put us on death row
Just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
Then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
Then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all
But ninety-percent unfair, care? Nah
Alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand, more prisons
So these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
They for grossing a bigger business, imagine
We being used, imagine, the truth shall be told

[Chorus]


Uh-uh-uh, what up?
Uh, I'm tryna, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna get something
Uh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up?
I say, what up?
Uh-uh, I'm tryna

Sometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie
Sometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride
Sometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe
Sometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside, when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
We kill the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
The various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? Then I rewind
A time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home
Negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity they parted our families
They put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh!
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar
Four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
Four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming, back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?
Call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do
Thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
The reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
Slaves

Uh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
It's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says "get on my level hoe"
You're a vanity slave
We all vanity slaves
and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here
Hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
You know them checks come in
I'm tryna get something, but what up?


[Kendrick Lamar]
It's like I don't think you fully understand who I am, y'know?
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I don't represent no colors, I represent my lil' sisters and brothers
I'm the oldest, nigga
And if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Check it out

I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z
until I finally realised that Jay wasn't me
I took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
Critics say I don't be killing this shit but I know I do
because I used to practice early morning and then after school
I'm working on my hooks my nigga, I ain't tryna battle you
But even if I did, I guarantee I'd overshadow you
Like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
I'ma close cut to Common and Gucci Mane
Now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
Because I can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 Regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
I wear a heart on my shoulder
'Member when we used to make the boost look like Motorola?
Your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
Then went to jail when we got older
That shit is a bad odor, but still I remain focussed
In due time, I'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
That shit's embarrassing huh
Hope no one pay you no mind
But it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
Can you relate to my story? Can you follow my dreams
and admirations that I had ever since I was thirteen?
My momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who I do it fo'
My pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
But he always questioned when I'ma drop my debut CD
How long this gon' take nigga? You still haven't ate nigga
At twenty-two I had two cars and my own place nigga
It's a sacrifice I try to tell him
That's when he turn to BET and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
I ate tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
I just wanna hear you heard

[Chorus]
Yep, yep, that's my word
Make a statement with these nouns and verbs
I represent the liquor that's poured out on the curb
Listen to my nouns and verbs (man I wanna be heard)
Like a cattle with sheep
While y'all sleep I re-up, cooking up all day
like a mad scientist in that laboratory
Motherfuck what a critic got to say, I'ma be heard

[Kendrick Lamar]
What up Dasan? I ain't forgot nigga
You developed me, telling me I was hot nigga
You believed in me first, that's what's for sure
At the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
But me and Dave kind of felt you lost the passion
A lot was going on in your life and you needed space
But still I should have came to you first to tell you what happened
But I was seventeen and figured it's best I stay away
And I wrong, I was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what I'd done
But I'm telling you we ain't done
Matter of fact, how's your sons? What they up to?
Remember they used to run away while you had worked on ProTools?
People I used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but I was on it
Me, you and Dave was on it
Buzzing like Charlotte Hornets when that tape dropped
Where them beats nigga? It's been five years since we had rocked
Time to be heard

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
So can you feel it?
When you hear it do it pulsate your spirit?
Does it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick?
The truth can set you free if you Do the Right Thing
Word to Spike Lee, don't he look like Sounwave?
That's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night
Twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
I spread love like a Hippy, but I'm a (Black) one
with Jesus Christ passion, I swear on the bible
Tabernacle to all my rivals, I ain't mad
You hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because I figure I can make a way with these stanzas
I probably can't heal cancer, but I can heal the city
My niggas, tell me you with me
And if you is won't you pop my CD in
Open up your trunk, then let it bump, so I can be heard
Yeah, uh huh

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
D-Dave, what up nigga?
Matt Jeezy [laughs]


Come here, girl
Oh, you want me to touch you right there?
Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair
Oh you want it? Oh you want it right now
Like that? I got you baby
All on you baby
Push it back on daddy
Push it back on daddy baby

I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory, life isâ¦
I seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
Life is long as infinity this was the final calling
No birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking
We all nervous and crying, moving in caution
In disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking, swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover, the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into dust
Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling âheâs aliveâ
Backpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroomâs been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
(Itâs happening) no more running from world wars
(Itâs happening) no more discriminating the poor
(Itâs happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
I swore I seen it vividly
A moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
Thunder like number four, then I heard
âWhat have you did for meâ
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
That dated back to June 17th, 1987
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly âfore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didnât try for you, say I didnât ride for you
I tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, Iâmma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me
Always camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered
Revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
All man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
I guess Iâm running in place trying to make it to church

Young nigga act an ass
Young nigga act a fool
Young nigga get yoâ cash
Young nigga do what it do
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Young nigga go, young nigga go
Whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
Just take it all back before the light switch


Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Hooray
Pimp-pimp hooray
Pimp-pimp

Iâm sick and tired of being tired
Canât pick a side, the Gemini
Prophesize if we living, I
Promise momma not to feel no lie
Seen black turn âem Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know Iâm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it wonât be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gonâ ball again âfore he call us home
World is going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
Itâs a tidal wave, itâs a thunderdome

Get God on the phone
I just got a raise (I just got a raise)
Spent it all on me (I spent it all on me)
Diamonds all appraised (diamonds all appraised)
And Iâm bossing up (and Iâm bossing up)
Bitch get out the way (bitch get out the way)
Iâm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that Iâm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and
Ah, my dollars ainât foldinâ, you was never the homie

Seen black turn âem Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know Iâm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?

Get God on the phone
Said it wonât be long
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jiggaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
(Whatâs up, my nigga?)

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards triple digits
Parallel park like an alien, canât visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
(Hello Billy)
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we jugginâ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we jugginâ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I donât relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought Iâd seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali âbout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, Iâm about to let my hair down on hoes
Top billing thatâs a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two Iâm not done
2Teez told me that I am the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee thatâs something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
Waterâs like twenty-five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch I get buck, Iâm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, Iâm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me come here now lilâ baby
Iâm fuckin, Iâm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda
Pistol and poverty, come get to know us
(Get Top on the phone)

Who doing the drums?
Man put that nigga on the drums man
Yep all day, Mortal Man and Kunta
Alright, from the top!


[Kendrick Lamar:]
So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps. I said âYou know what, girl? You crazy.â Then she asked me what he said

[Kendrick Lamar and Anna Wise:]
(What did the Asian say?)
A peace of mind
Thatâs what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said âtaking my timeâ
Meditation is a must, it donât hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
Thatâs what the Indian said, I needed demand
Telling me longevity is in the dirt, should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, donât you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
Thatâs what the black man said, I needed to push me
To the limit to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from hair cut to a wool
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said ânigga, come back to reality for a weekâ
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldnât be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mineâs
Thatâs what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it donât even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
Iâmma make you some promises that you just canât ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist
If I donât target your market
If you ainât signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
You work toward your masterâs mortgage, I need a piece

[Bilal:]
I holler, âWhat you do? What you say?â
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, âWhat you do? What you say?â
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

What the black man say?
Tell âem we donât die, tell âem we donât die
Tell âem we donât die, we multiply
Tell âem we donât die, tell âem we donât die
Tell âem we donât die, we multiply
Tell âem we donât die, tell âem we donât die
Tell âem we donât die, we multiply
Tell âem we donât die, tell âem we donât die
Tell âem we donât die, we multiply


[SZA (Kendrick Lamar):]
They say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
(Tell âem when you went to the park and everybody came back andâ¦)
And welfare donât mean well for you, you, you, you
(What about when you tried to do a side for that but youâ¦)
They tell me that my billâs past due, due, due, due
(Talk about the charge you gotâ¦)
And preacher man donât always tell the truth, truth, truth
(Do you believe in God? If you donât, itâs cool)

[SZA & Jay Rock (Kendrick Lamar):]
(But) head is the answer, head is the future
Donât second guess yourself
(Donât tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgotâ¦)
Come on give me some help, yeah
Head is the answer, head is the future
Donât second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help

[Lance Skiiiwalker:]
And I just wanna
And I just wanna
Straight up
Eyes with my head
And I canât use some help
Straight up

[SZA:]
Head is the future


[Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And this I know

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular Iâm drunk
How can I can make them popular, pop emâ when I want
See Iâm livinâ with anxiety, duckinâ the sobriety
Fuckinâ up the system I ainât fuckinâ with society
Justice ainât free, therefore justice ainât me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now Iâm thinkinâ to myself, hollow tips is all I got
Now Iâm drinkinâ by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckinâ door and blowinâ out
Every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
Iâm gone

[Anna Wise:]
Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

[Punch & Kendrick Lamar:]
Drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippinâ the handle
Lit off henny, Iâm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, Iâve engaged in such a gamble
Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
Thatâs a bit ambitious maybe Iâm trippinâ
Maybe Iâm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance
Itâs such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still donât recognize my flaws
I guess Iâm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me Iâm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a little space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king

[Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock:]
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that Iâm blind
I know that Iâm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I canât compromise
A tape worm couldnât cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein me as I pacify
But couldnât fathom the meaning of seeinâ sacrifice
Iâm passinâ lives on a daily, maybe Iâm losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why Iâm awake
Iâm sleep walkinâ, Iâm street stalkinâ, Iâm outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a facade
Wait


These metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what I see
A Gemini, duality personalities always conflict in me

[Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green:]
Oh! But donât be scared of me, girl
I can explain
I know itâs foreign to you
I know itâs hard to believe
God give me the favor
Let me explain
More than a compliment
And I could use some assistance, let me show you how
I can explain
Oh shando! I spin around two times
Iâll be there with the answer
Let me explain

[Cee Lo:]
Iâm bizarre, avant-garde
Both sides of me are evenly odd
Itâs attractive
Youâre intrigued
Am I mortal man or make believe?
Anything you want
I can explain
I can explain it
Any misunderstandings, baby
Let me explain
I can explain it
Why donât you sit and talk to me?
I can explain
Let me explain it, ah yeah
Let me explain

[Kendrick Lamar:]
My mama told me that I was different the moment I was invented
Estranged baby, no Iâm not ashamed
I recommend every inch of your lunatic ways
Praise the lord, you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
You know the male species can be redundant
I mean we love a woman and think we can satisfy her
Between sheets, covers and pillows
Iâm promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
Iâm promising that Iâm acknowledging you as my hero
Cause you believe in me
No youâre not easily impressed
But I possess qualities that you need to see
Look at my flaws, look at my flaws
Look at my imperfections in awe
Look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
And yours equally valued
You stick out like an alien compared to those around you
And thatâs alright because I like it
You and me are the same
Hopefully Iâm invited, hopefully you donât change
Because I know for sure who you are

[Kendrick Lamar & CeeLo Green:]
I can explain
Your mama raised you, your daddy raised you
Hand washing your clothes on Sunday
Let me explain
Walking your brother to school, three miles away
To feed him knowledge
I can explain
Donât you explain that, donât you explain the reason why your mind, it travels
Let me explain
I wanna know what you think
I wanna pick your brain when I see you
But donât you ever
Let me explain
Oh shando!
I spin around two times, a blessing in disguise
I can explain
I know for sure who you are
Youâre the goddess of the odd
I am yours
I can explain

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours
I am yours

[Part II:]

Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, Iâm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatinâ the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like yâall fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writinâ your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookinâ like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchinâ my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countinâ my coin
Hope itâs evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecasted my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
Gunshots

[Part III:]

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on

This is a fifteen minute song
Weâre just jamminâ out, we on stage
Taz, we just jamminâ out
Hundred thousand
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

Now I donât let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see
But I donât shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ainât the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth

But head is the answer
Head is the future
Donât second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need yâall to help me out right now
Head is the answer
Head is the future, itâs the future, that nigga said
Donât second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, my background singer
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

I said, girl you make me wanna uh
The ho screaming now
I said baby you make..
You make me wanna just AHHH!
Baby you got me speechless right now
Laughs
I gotta take it there, I ainât even playinâ no more
Said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground, to the ground ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mamaâs around, if your mamaâs around
If your mamaâs around, if your mamaâs around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination, sheâs young nigga chasinâ
And she can get this dick too!

I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit, and watch what itâs gonâ do


[Hook:]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Iâm down on my luck
And itâs something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and itâs breaking me down honey

Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnât hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

[Hook:]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Iâm down on my luck
And itâs something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and itâs breaking me down honey

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she donât give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Hook:]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Iâm down on my luck
And itâs something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and itâs breaking me down honey

I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they shoâ is crazy"
And I said âwhy?â
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
Youâre banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, youâre crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ainât shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that youâre looking for dope
These days ainât no compromise
And your pain ainât mines half the time
A brand new excuse ainât shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town

In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

[Hook:]
Why so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said Iâm down on my luck
And itâs something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and itâs breaking me down honey

Pimp pimp hooray

Aye groove the window down oh shit I'm getting high

Shake the nonbelievers off I'm tryna navigate a million
But yo first lets hit the store you know I love Korean

[Hook]
2, 2 fucking raw (Face down, ass up)

Heroin, extacy, oxycontin, vicodin, coca cola everything up in our jeans
Even methamphetamines
Get this bread by any means
Pcp, lsd, transactions frequently
Turn ya job into a ki
Turn that ki into a beach
Turn that beach into ur sleep
Rest ya head, remain neat
Haters love to hate a G
Gossip on ya bakery
Wish they had the recipe
Swear this life is meant for me
Tired of crackin niggas heads in the stolen challenger
Hopped up out the passenger and merked the DAâs messenger
Every corner, camera
Nigga I'm just tryna live
Shitty on a shitty curb
Niggas can ya front ya kids
See how niggas get it in
Trappin so we live in sin

[Verse 1: ScHoolBoy Q]
What it's like for a nigga like me
Livin' out his backpack every night needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga!

Ones for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that motherfucker to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate dawg
I was hangin' on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dawg
Know what I'm sayin'?
Nigga prayin' up to God just hopin' that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for
Load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray
Just wanna say

[Hook: ScHoolBoy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga
We all blessed my nigga

[Verse 2: ScHoolBoy Q]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see, my nigga just lost his son while I'm here huggin' on my daughter
I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinkin' of some bullshit to tell him, like
"It'll be okay. You'll be straight, it'll be aight."
Well, fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or puttin' in work, fuck it, then I'm ridin'!
You know wassup, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fuckin' fool
To be livin' by the street rules
Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong brah
Remain' solid brah
Keep playin' ball cause it's the only way up out it, brah
A nigga proud of ya'
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed, I'll have whatever he needs
We the last of a dyin' breed, live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Hook]

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere
And I'mma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everwhere
But I'mma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Livin' in a premature place - wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates - break
Every time a bullet detonate - dates
Of obituary carry crates of a scary picture
With a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga)
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed
Take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas, that neglect, your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step, step my nigga
One, two, skip, skip
Back, back, look both ways
Pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dawg
It ain't nothin' but a bunch of fuck niggas dawg
In a minute everybody gon' be winnin'
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

[Hook]


Drugs, drugs, got them hoes again

[ScHoolboy Q]
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down, comin' down
Comin' down off a pill, see what next we on
Bad little bitch in the driver's seat
Fuck them rappers, should be bumpin' me
Puff on your own, shit, I puff alone
Won't pass the weed, but I'll pass a bitch
Mastermind, the bitch stole my dick
Stuck me up, and didn't hit a lick
Retaliated, had to bust off quick
Uh, let me see, here's some orange juice
You like taking E? Hennessey, yeah, on the rocks
Take a shot and I'll take a bop, uhhh
Little sarcasm, swag O.D. got 'em all laughing
G Hippy, he gon' orgasm
Leanin' out the 4, now I'm really spazzin'
Hmm, Backwoods, that good, high as hell
YSL, nigga, rack me out, rack me out, I say rack me out!
Just sold it out, then stack me out
Fuck all that shit you be talkin' bout
On the come up and the world can vouch
Been around the world, now my mommy house
Uh, pulled her panties south and I stuck it north
Yeah I fucked, of course
Having intercourse, I can fuck for life
Guess I fucked her right
She keep talking like

You nasty (you nasty)
You nasty (you nasty)

A groovy nigga that's way too G
(Tryna tell you baby!)

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
He might say cuz but he ain't fucking with cuz
Yea I'm Q, but you can call me Quincy
If you want or whatever baby, it's all love
Fuck all that rapping, let me talk to you
Book you a ticket so we can kick it
Make an escape somewhere we'll be safe
Close your purse, I got my Visa on me
Pick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey
Take off my saboteur, wipe your nose for ya
Climb a mountain in the snow for ya
You see these dummies always cut you lose
But so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two
I pay attention, I can listen too
You say he fucking who? Fresh out the shower, let me smell your hair
Garnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets
Let me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it?
From a lost child to a woman
Eye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
(Strolling in the party)
Cause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me
Just tryna give it to ya
(Walking in the dark)

[Verse 2: Dom Kennedy]
A 5'3" stallion
Daddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian
I don't see the challenge
Of having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance
I told her light that candle
I heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples
Yo ass is like a handle
See us on the front page, that'll be a scandal
Take off this red shirt, then my flannel
I need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals
Hit the coochie like a dime sack
Ain't those Gucci, didn't I buy that?
Close your eyes, go and try that
You only live once and I know I got you soaking wet
Is the liquor store open yet
I need some moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint
Back shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation
In the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Underground Royal
Flow over they heads, air duct
Upper crust, toast bread

YouTube clips can't show it all
Come and get down if you really wan' get up, baby doll
Ain't nobody 'round to judge, go on
Get if off your chest, vent, come up out that dress, bitch
She ain't take offense
Proceeded to take hits of the pregame twist, smoke out, smash
Grub a little bit, pass out, post-game events
Too high to find the remote, fell asleep to a infomercial
Woke up in her mouth, reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel
OG my strain, rarely do I blaze purple
Some of them growers be in a rush fucking the game up
You gon' learn about all that stuff long as you hang around us
Go on roll up

[Hook]


[Intro]
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 AM, summer night
My hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that

[Verse 1]
Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'm a fuck the world

You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk driving, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help

[Hook]
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews

Nigga weed and brews, unbelieveable
Got a freak or two, in my vehicle
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink
Then we mix it up, call it Pikachu
With a little bit of crack, little bit of dope
Little bit of smoke, little coke
Little weed, when they on them pills
Little bit of E, little bit of shrooms
Little bit of deuce, what it do, hand on the wheels
And I keep the illest, trillest bitches while I'm swaggin' it
Crush a bit, little bit, that's my pursuit of happiness

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
If I fucked her twice, I might change her life
If I change her life she might hit my weed
We could have her some and we could run off with three
Her, Mary and me, I'll keep it strictly G
My philosophy upon living right
Nigga weed and brews, hit that every night
And her pussy nice cause I fight the bitch
Beat it down and shit, I be clowning with
Black Hippy crew, how swag am I
Be the reason why, she wanna drown my dick
But I soon realized, she was super dry
No paper planes, the bangers are fly
Don't act surprised, too much Loc inside
Let's get stupid high, to where I can't reply
Love smokin' dope, I won't compromise

Did what I did, who woulda knew you was the cops?
Talkin all on the phone to your homies about a plots
Got me up in the box, thought that you was my nigga
You got your sentence reduced cause you told 'em I pulled the trigger
And I was lookin out for you! (YOU!)
Tried to show him just how we do
Put all my shit aside and now I'm through
Figured that I would keep it Crippy this what this real nigga get me
Locked up for like a century while you get chances of a Bentley
Fuck, my old bitches while I beat my dick plenty
My shootin figure itchy, but I hope somebody get him

Cuz got me hot, better get his ass popped
Can't get over how we was, tough as leather

Devil's in the eyes, babies always cry
Poppa never home, fuck it we all alone
Tryin to get rich yeah that talkin right
Grab me the beaker I'll measure the white
Heat up the water, drop it in pot

[ScHoolboy Q]
Satan in your soul, let it take control
Oxycontin fiends, keep the foil low
Let the pill burn, inhale exhale it slow
Let your heart explode, drop you to the flo'
I gets the dough, I hustle hard
Ace Hood ain't got shit on moi
Green beans, 80's for sure
They like what I'm talkin bout
You know what I'm talkin bout?
No syringes or nothin just heroins cousin smoke mufflers out

[Chorus 1 + Chorus 2]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Only Lords knows, and only time'll tell

Music in my mind, vibratin down my spine

Now I get bread for my audio
(Call me your pusher these bars that I'm pushin)
You know I ain't talkin a Xanny bro

Loosin my brain while recordin on

[Outro]
[laughter]
Q! [3X]
Ooh-ooh! [3X]
Yeahhhhh, Q!!


[Verse 1]
They say the gangsters back, kid got a heart attack
Straight out insomniac, let's get this fucker live
Loadin up pistols while gettin high
45 nine, we smoking sitting in nickels and dimes
My little nigga 12 said he with it, yeah
Gave him a sherm stick and watched him while he hit it
Soon as he lit it cause was finished, now cock back the gat
Little mask and gloves, let's get to buisiness
But they worry about Osama
Killed a bitch nigga and get his family manana
Didn't get a coma nor a cent for the karma
Just an imaginary stripe so he can hold his head in honor
Zombie land a bunch of dead men walkin
Livin abortion they oughta raise the price on coffins
Fucking make a killing but I ain't dying up in prison
Fully loaded clip my brain up to the ceiling

[Hook]
Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know
Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled
Fear around here, I smell death around here
Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here

[Verse 2]
They say 2012 the world gon end
Shit it been over since Raymond recruited soldiers
1969 evolution of devils time
Ain't walking up in no shrine shit I'm living a life of crime
Pops never gave a chance my mom crying
She can see it in my eyes, I lost my mind
Sneakin out the window with angel dust in my endo
Keys to her ignition new mission ya betta limbo
Fire pits let to eject I hardly miss
Nigga ditch sleep on my dog ain't that a bitch?
And I ain't on my Odd Future tip
But snatch a nigga intestines from his nose and tell his ass to shit
But they worry about Osama
Blood and Crip niggas lifetime of Jeffery Dhamers
Flashy for the moment I'm on it I pop your collar
Suicidal ain't fucking with these young connivers, we rivals

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Didn't learn to much in school
But out I learned some shit, 36 a kilo 28 grams a zip
Pot brownies and white cookies
Cops'll pat me down but won't touch on my girls tooshi
Fuck they sent the lady cop they tryna book me
All else fails balloon packs tampon that pussy
Back to the set to laugh about it and get it off
Lobster tails and butter sauce same clothes still a boss
On a mothafuckin' robbing spree
Probably be televised, bitch I want the world to see
Now you dumb fuckas heard of him
Sickest nigga out I found out that blood's burgundy
But they worry about Osama
9/11 passengers ain't seen this type of drama
Vietnam wars I'm sending copper galore
Bodies hit the floor god knows I'm playing lord for sure

[Hook]

[Outro]
Make money, make money-money-money
Take money, take money-money-money
Make money, steal money-money-money
Kill money, my money-money-money


[Verse 1]
Gloomy on sunny days
Shadows no house or trees
Prayers now close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see
Hoodies and weaponry
NaÃ¯ve to being free
Locked up, we chasing keys
How ya eyes investigate us
While we look up to entertainers, ball players, pistol bangers
Big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger
The burn fuckin burn
Every step to getting deeper
Survival my main concern
Marinating in satanâs sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping god still keep me blessed
With a dark shield for my armor

[Verse 2]
Promises man I promised
None of them goals accomplished
Promises man I promised
To be loyal and honest
Promises man I promised
Lied on separate occasions
Promises man I promised
My promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like
Feeling like superman
I might crip tonight
I bring loss to life
A gruesome site
Look who done got involved
Its no different from wars, its kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking Iâve gone too far
Ask god for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rest your sins with pray
But Iâve done did some things I donât think I could ever wash away


[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, I'm started up. Let's go
Dippin' through your solar system
Hopefully steal your heart, you be the victim
No I wouldn't share
Hey, I did the crime, now close your eyes
Let me ease your mind, I won't steer you blind
Came right on time, just keep behind
Let me guide the way, It's your lucky day
Let's fornicate, play the way that grown ups play
Teach you how to drive a stick baby girl it'll be okay
First gear, second gear, third gear, hell yeah
Panties droppin' I can treat her proper
Poke my [?] in your [?] let me be your doctor
I can please you right, let me give you live
Little CPR, Can I use your car?
Metal to the floor, see you drive me hard
You's a superstar let me be your bodyguard
Wetter than tsunami, lord, Let me dive in
Through your tidal wave

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q & Jhene Aiko]
Scorpio, sex drive
Gemini, sex drive (Pisces)
Sex drive (Virgo)
Sex drive (Aquarius)
Sex drive (Saggitarius)
Let me be your sex drive
Satisfaction fills me up inside
Can you turn me on?
Be my sex right only if your sex is right
Can you cut me on?

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
As the world spins, we gain power
You stay on wet, you a stormy shower
Mind fuck you girl, undress you we can fuck for hours
Day and night, no rubbers we love this, no covers
Freak you with my tongue, you also go down where I'm hung
Open up, a chapter begun, we can build like a factory hun
[?] sits right on the sun
Solar eclipse as soon as I cum, soon as we cum
[?]
We cruise, you done won my heart over, how can we lose
From a fantasy to real life, you I choose
Came a long way from fuckin' friends we was due
Just me and you, ooh, just me and you
Never scared of commitment, see you my boo
We can get ghost, get lost, and the bond is true
Flying through the city, clouds, [?]
Saying vows, fuck around and have a child

[Repeat Hook]

[Bridge: Jhene x2]
Break me down and build me up again
Love me 'til the sun comes up and then
We can fuck and fuck and fuck again

[Hook x2]


[Verse 1:]
Ain't got no jewelry on still I'm shinin' hard
Ain't got no bodyguard walkin' solo through the mall
Bitches and the hoes know they see me they like: "There he go!"
They be like: "There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!"
Cheifin' like a muthafuckin' Seminole
Here we go, off probation probably go to Me-hi-co
Furthermore, can't find this in the store, this shit ain't for the low
Got my daughter swaggin' like her muthafuckin' daddy though
The patio, what a muthafuckin' view
Nappy chin hairs, bitch I'm muthafuckin' Q
Uhhh, muthafucka', muthafucka' yeah
Fuckin' is my favorite word, reason why I'm fuckin' her
She swallow my dick and balls, whatever occur
Purr, I love that kitty cat
Ass fat, throw it back, I can't believe you wifing that
Deepthroat, seven or eleven, she's a double gulp
My pistol drawn, her boyfriend got me paranoid
Nigga try sneakin' up on me and I'm makin' noise
But what I failed to understand
I'm the muthafuckin' man, ran into him, he's a fan
Goddamn...

[Hook:]
I'm shinin' hard, they be like: "There he go!"
No bodyguard, they be like: "There he go!"
Up in your broad, they be like: "There he go!"
They be like: "There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!"
HiiiPoweR bitch, they be like: "There he go!"
Black Hippy shit, they be like: "There he go!"
Magnificent, they be like: "There he go!"
They be like: "There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!"

[Verse 2:]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No, it be this nigga here just lookin' at you lames
With my niggas, yo we bettin' on the Laker game
Even though my niggas lost another iTunes check to Dame
Garcia Vegas, yeah, that bitch be burnin' slow
'Quip a four, now the blunts go back around like merry-go
Uh, fo' sho', ain't no need for niggas out here frontin' do'
Metapho', how I come with it? I don't fuckin' know
Y'all actin' like that TDE don't run L.A
Coast ain't been this hard since Pac, Death Row, and Dr. Dre
Word to Dr. Dre, Detox is like a mix away
So go ahead and let the grown-ups work and go somewhere and play
Worldwide Holocaust, cuh we murder shit
Without a gun or knife, it's just a fuckin' hit
Pussy drips, raining in her cervix, I'm a fuckin' pimp
Saggin' low, crack a nigga bitch just like pistachio

Uh, pull your panties down from under you
Beat that pussy up, make you wanna holla Q
Drunk' than a bitch, high on that Mary Jane
Pussy in my mouth, pussy on my pinky ring
Nasty, make me do it in the backseat
Swear this marijuana keep it cracking
Lights, camera, action, I ain't doing nothing to the cash
Money, money, money, weed, fashion
Draped up and dripped out, keep the trees passing
Girl twerk that thing up, fuck me, fuck rapping
Days of our lives so clap, clap that cake
Spreading your thighs I pump, pump your brakes, aye

[Tinashe:]
Just give me the trees
And we can smoke it ya
Just give me the drink
And we can pour it ya
And my enemies they see me living now
And if you're on with me then you'll be winning now

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Most of these niggas shouldn't be next to us
We keep our distance from those, those acting like hoes
Zany imposed, weed in my clothes, cubics is gold
Your wig'll get told, put the realest niggas
Niggas, product of cap pillers, gangbangers, and dealers
Streets keep watching, aye, click boom the ghetto bird get shot down
Straight to the top now, they want a third strike on my background
But nah homie, put the mask on when I slide on 'em
Put the cash in the safe and here's a extra slug 'fore I shake
You smoke faster than me with a eighth
Or better yet a wet break on a plate
Burning your faith, all your senses covered in tape
Fuckin' with them boys in blue, chill out before I send them rags at you
You running to the cops saying, "How we do?"
Saying it's just rap and them lines ain't true
So I just do Q, fuck it, a mÃ©nage Ã  two, or maybe trois
Baby girl need a papa, I be her dada
Coochie smacking, give praise to Allah
Get blazed in my car, with Oxymoron, Rock

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Rock got it, Rock came from rock bottom
Sparked the flames, still remain as a top shotta
I ain't no backpack rapper, I ain't no lyricist
And if we ain't talking to you, mind your business then
Cold with it, Black Hippy, yeah, we cold niggas
All the girlies love us, get a whiff of us
They bones quiver, heard some clown throwing stones at us
Holding boulders champ once you hear that "YAWK," watching domes shatter
It's Top Dawg we runnin' rap, whack rappers, feline
Reason why we don't run with cats
Nine double O five nine, where my family at
Pull up in that family van holding tools like the handyman
And to be real not with all this rapping politickin'
Rapper competition, wrapped up my position
'Til I'm finished, 'til I make a couple tickets
Then I'm outtie on them islands with my crimmies chillin'
Hide your feelings, now can I live?
Look I gotta keep my feet on top of the dirt
Cause everywhere I go they like "When you dropping some work?"
Been a threat since birth
The rap game's pallbearer when I'm droppin' the hearse
I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Industry's nightmare, red strings in my Nike Airs
Yeah, the white pair, I'm Jay Rock, America's most wanted
My charges? Killing MC's without warning
Rock!

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
It's Ab-Soul, gimme the loot, I'm the skinny Biggie
In New York City with Puffy, puffing a sticky
All odds against me, still even the score
Probably why I'm always OT on tour
TDE, believe me we want war
I don't even know what piece I like most no more
Two fingers, two triggers, what's the difference?
We all gon' die one day, until then I'm gettin' paid
My grandma watching so I ain't gon' curse
Still gifted like a Wale verse, backwood full of OG
Bobby Johnson medicine in my soul to trynna dodge the coffin
And these days are so bittersweet
I guess it's just a balance we battle naturally
And y'all still trippin' off of Jay-Z tweets
I still got laps to run when me and Jay-Z meet
Peep, Soul brother number two
The first one used to make beats for CL Smooth
Top got the S550 but the CL smooth
And rolling weed is the only time I see L's move
Soul!

[Verse 4: Isaiah Rashad]
I think I found my second home
Sunny California and it's your little nigga brother
You ain't meant for corners, it's what they told me
So I never looked back, I got a shell in the bag
Fat as elephant ass, so we flirt in the path
Passing propellers I tell her, tell her we flying just listen
See we diamond just shining and they gon' find us glistening
Brought sand to the beach and we left with your bitch
For the record in Guinness I'm a hecklin' menace
Where is Robin, I'm Given', fuckin' minding my business
He a regular victim, of some regular in women
Regular niggas, you always cater to sluts
You always wasting my time, you always faking the funk
I put your motherfuckin' dream in your face
You keep lookin' for some women to be all in your face
That deep dussy reach niggas, keep dussy
That Tennessee dussy make a nigga be dussy
You can never rap better than me, cause you ain't dedicated
You ain't underrated, you ain't underlooked
You ain't overbooked, you just undercooked
It's supposed to be me and my niggas in the record book
Now they got me out here by myself still fresh as fuck

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
I hate y'all, I'd do anything to replace y'all, shout out to Face Mob
A ghetto boy 'til I'm unemployed with a day job
And kicking boxes, I kick ass and then kick knowledge
I'm way more polished than 99% of the scholars you thought had graduated
I'm the master that masturbated on your favorite emcee
Until the industry had wanted me assassinated
You either corny or an opportunist
I let you eat, now go back to church and steal crackers at communion
What I been doing? I'm about to crack the Da Vinci Code
Yeah, and nothing's been the same since they dropped Control
And tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes
Ha-ha, joke's on you, high-five
I'm bulletproof, your shots'll never penetrate
Pin a tail on a donkey, boy, you been a fake
I got my thumb on Hip Hop, and my foot in the back of your ass
Aftermath get the last laugh
I serve niggas like master Geoffrey
Jump on the curb, turn a shotty to a verb if you let me
You know I'm a killer, I'm on your head, you know I'm a killer
The West Coast Cosa Nostra under oath 'til it's over
You over owe us, so what the fuck?
I fuck you niggas up, I fuck you niggas up, she suck and fuck
I fuckin' duck you fuckin' niggas like when I want
You go at us, you going fuckin' nuts
Acting irrational, pop you then pop an Adderall
Know the drill like a lateral, nigga
I'm more Pappy Mason than Pastor Mason
Pacing back and forth, racing my thoughts on embracing Daytons
I spilled blood on my apron cooking this shit up
I feel like some of y'all is hating
Quite frankly your bitch booty should thank me for grabbing it
Turn these hoodrats to actresses, what a magic trick?
Accidents never happen when murder's involved
Emaculate tactics so follow me, if you need me just call on me
I say "Hold up, wait a minute
Your career ain't shit unless you got some Kendrick in it!"
Your pussy ain't shit, ain't no room is left on my dick
Unless you look like Jordin Sparks, make my mark on the clitoris, muah
Hollywood's been good to me, lil' hood nigga used to pawn mom's jewelry
Family jewels big as fuck and I got the balls to say it
Balls deep, ballin' out 'til Spalding need a replacement
I'm outchea, the West in your mouth, chea
Invest in the vests of Vietnam vets when you out near
The white court building spilling its Merlot
Fillin' women, a Virgo, pimp the industry
Remember these Stacy Adams and furcoats
Shook, you're scared to death, you're scared to look
In the mirror when Kendrick is near you
King, Kendrick

Unravel the backwoods and crumble up the trees
Nigga, please, your skull missing now homie feel the breeze
These bullets burning gon' be hard for you to breathe
These bullets burning damn near possible to bleed
Off that alcohol, that nozzle flammable
Beef I prey on my preyer react like animal
Pussy, I split you like camel toe, my shoelaces matching my flannel
We be loading up ammo, y'all be making them channels
Yellow tape by them candles, gang members with killing sprees
On our agendas, real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Facial expressions say surrender

Access denied nigga, refrigerate Ziploc

Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now the pressure creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a bust out in the 80's but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs

What's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!

Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6: 45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some wood for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Wise night, but that's my life
Prescription drugs

What's wrong you tired? You mad? OK I love you daddy

[Hook:]
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
O-X-Y, a moron
O-X-Y, a moron

[Verse 1:]
Crazy, got my stash somewhere in her Mercedes
80's, get these off new shoes for my baby
Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi
What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta re-up 50 times just to get a rack off, ungh
I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only re-up'd one time
Where the sun barely shine and it rain for about
Nine months out the year, man it's something right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers, when I look up at y'all city like lookin' in the mirror
Damn near had a career, just might shed a tear, ungh
Man, this shit right here for my niggas who ain't make it home
Sitting on a tear, got a dap to a nigga bright in here, feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes, I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like clear, ungh
Big body cold like a Polar Bear, ungh
I done sold more shit than hookers, expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Vanity slave, got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same, even if I got life, I ain't saying a name

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Oh wee, cops bringing dogs so they don't sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50, you can get one for 30 if you let me hook this titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr.J
I prescribe you I'm your doctor kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroine
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit so I don't listen
In fact "we livin' to die" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

[Hook]

Snowflakes keep falling on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at 10 tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And everyday is full of jokers like a deck of cards
So, I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome-piece
But, I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfucking Minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
Cause we out here winning, brought my dogs from out the reservoir
And I'mma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscious so weak I need to split it up in 7 parts
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amare's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the V-M-A's, told a joke - he never laughed
The rap diablo, free your mind my motto
And we all gonna be good if TreeJ ever hit the lotto
So arigato
So, shit you know I'm world famous
And R. Kelly been told me I'm the world's greatest
But still to fall in love is like an orgasm
Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, getting shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it
Thank God that I made it
Ask Q where Dave is
He'll probably tell you that he's rolling midnights out in Vegas
When I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we're going to the banquet
And Jimmy got the burner, but he don't wanna murder
And clockwork somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
(Husband, isn't this your language?)
That man must be a alien
I really can't explain it, shit
It's just a little cocaine sniff
But the lines is longer than parades is
I think it's time to give me all your praises
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit
And if you wanna legal battle - send your ass to David (that's my lawyer)
I'm half man-half amazing
Probably half God, but that don't fit my calculations
I know the planet Earth is about to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it
We only grow from anguish

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
Yea, Miller Mac
(Miller Mac)
Miller Mac, Mac Miller
(Miller Mac)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes falling on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this Game of Thrones, it is known
I got the 4G, L-T-E connection boards
No Control, fuck Ken Lamar (Fuck you Kendrick!)
I don't vote, I never registered
But I'm a magnet for them zeros call me Edward Sharpe
I wake up feeling dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember
Smiled as I saw Jerm, nerding out with Josh Berg
Talking in (?), and drinking Arnold Palmer
Any other room, watching C-Span with E. Dan
Land out the baseline, doing drums with his freehand
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though, man
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit
Driving through the hood she did not have a reaction
With a 6 year old she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like fuck those cops
God damn, it just don't stop
I know my father probably wish I would just smoke pot
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yea, I've had the same outfit for 6 days straight
And Still all these bitches will get in position because
I got their pussies all dripping in pain
Somehow, I'm making this music it's just to relate to
And I got the life-raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection, I broke the mirror
It's only for protection, shit keep getting weirder
Now I can't see a thing but, things never been clearer
Call the Mothman its Richard Gere (Its Richard Mother Fuckin' Gere!)
This is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere
And looking down like
We come in peace
I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]


[Verse 1 - The Weeknd:]
I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young God
That pussy kill be so vicious
My God white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

[Hook - The Weeknd:]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 2 - Schoolboy Q:]
Often, often, girl I do this often
In that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune
Awesome, 100 plus, can't this from the auction
Need a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking
Show that pussy, work that pussy
Who that pussy, that's my pussy
Wet that pussy, stroke that pussy
Ooh! I twist the weed
You on your phone texting your friend to come fuck
I wonder if it's the druggies with hoes or the millions of bucks
But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know

[Hook:]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross:]
Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'

[Hook:]
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often


I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it
She got a [*censored*] tattoo and you ain't even know it
We about to form a little groupie and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 70 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup

It's a groovy nigga, that's all day, Backwood hold three grams
Got a six-shooter, that revolver spinning, shell stuck inside, but won't jam
This hoody here about two stacks, hell yeah that bitch could gon' go ham
Molly in her drink, but she asked me to and oh yeah I got this on cam
Gangsta nigga, no trap beats, bet I still sound like that new shit
Originality in my blueprint, still Figg side, Figuero pimp
Her big ass where my palm hit, pull my dick out, she gon' balm it
Swag surfin' all through the world, slide through the sea on a comet
O-X-Y for these morons, that be that new shit I'm pushin'
Raise off of them pockets, bring more of them coffins
These niggas ain't popping, tell them old niggas to move on
Aw damn I done said it, all them can beheaded

She ain't single but she solo, you ain't even know it
Unsigned with sold out shows, you ain't even know it
My lips black but they ain't chapped, she ain't even know that
Let's have sex, she said, "Yes", you know she ain't "no" that
Seed of life on my chest, my head next to her breast
My mind all in the clouds, just bought an ounce of the best
No talking when I'm off that loud
I came quick so she pissed
You know I'm good for another round
But it's hard when everybody on your dick
Know real niggas that's crips, I know real niggas that's bloods
Know real niggas that's thugging like you ain't know what's up
Got codeine in my cup, got a couple checks that need cashing
And you could take that to the bank, what's life without a balance?
You ain't even know it, nigga I be everywhere you ain't even going
I thought it was snowing, but I'm just the coldest nigga out here flowin'
Sick of all that bullshit y'all been promoting, but
Carson in the motherfucking house
Del Amo, watch your motherfucking mouth
I took the game by storm, just to X men out
I'm crazy out my mind, I put my life on the line
The tortoise only makes progress when his neck sticks out
Just a little token of gold if you ain't know it, though

Respect, I get the utmost
I'm so dope I'm a walking kilo
36 Os, you don't even know I'm gettin' cheese like Cheetos
You mad that we BMFing, bitch-ass niggas steady PMSing
I never show my hands, can't know my plans
Gotta keep them guessing
Rock, I was off the scene
Now a nigga back like a four and a half
Shooting up the set like Spielberg
See the big picture when them hammers flash
I don't post a lot on Instagram
That's the quickest way they'll get you man
Leave that shit for the bitches man
Alphabet boys, they'll get your ass
IRS, they was on a nigga
Cashed them out, not I'm scot-free
Got my passport in my JanSport, now I'm overseas
You don't even know it
Rock been killin' this shit, no gloves, no mask on me
Just 100 thousand cash on me
Back then, I was doing bad, homie
All my bitches bad now
My old hoes try to keep tabs on me
Safe to say I'm the man now
Fuck ass nigga just stand down
'Fore the shots go up and it's man down
Hands down, still popping
No prescription, I'm flexing
Suplex a pussy, I've been off the edge
Too late to push me, nigga I ain't fell off
Used to move Frosted Flakes like Kellogg's
Pull up to the bank, count paper like tellers
Top Dawg, Money Gang, bitch, we've been on
Clothesline the beat, nigga, John Cena
Been having stripes, can't walk in my Adidas
Kicked in the door, hand on the Nina
Black Hippy shit, rock gon' bleed 'em

I'm turned up every day, you don't even know it
Got your bitch with me right now, you don't even know it
We turn up in the club, you don't even know it
Got a hundred bottles comin', you don't even know it
We came up from nothin', you don't even know it
Drive a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
Got a bitch that speak no English, she don't even know it
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes, you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean, you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from the bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don't even know it


Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch

Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like he bodying it
Ziplock full of J's, closet full of J's walking on my crib and he's Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like it's already in it
Murder with the ink, I'm Gotti in it
Don't get too popped if yo ass 2 Pac
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain't never holly that but I got a Maserati in it
That's my new addition, nobody in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas' ass, shit we money team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out
Same stacks on, bring the bands out, nigga should be workin on they money skeme
Back to the convers, kill em with one verse
Converse with the worst til one of our gun burst
Callin Archurelli, tell him niggas in one hearse
'Cus Compton ain't like the city of commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas love them choppas like we flyin in black cars
But you with the roost, thinkin a nigga was black though
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit em with numerous shots from the 4-4

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Pray for me, I'll make 30
Desert Eagle, my nails dirty

Made a mill, you ain't even know it
Tell Iluminati I'm down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga

Fuck the world on earth day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I've been paid
I'm a real nigga, you's arcade
Had a switch blade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama's couch
Now I'm going big, I can buy the house
You sell water down, I sell low for ounce
See this for adults who say where you from
If those hoes who gonna make me cum
With them fuck niggas we don't fuck with them
And fuck niggas gonna lose a lot
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drama
If the bed low I'mma stack the crown
Up the contraband in-between my gun
Before smoking dope I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G's, nigga pretty please
Condos, where it's sun and trees
10 keys with my 80's
Hoover hats like the star of David
Pull on shots unless kidney faded
Rent a pony, might go with Emmett
Move out the set but the set I'm banging

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round

Look, a young nigga really try'na stunt, fuck it
West side neighbors and I ain't budging
Independent niggas with no budget
If it ain't about a dollar gotta change subjects
Rap ass niggas ain't seen nothing
This flow here, niggas can't touch it
Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket
Shots going off in the streets
10 hut, big squads are with me
See niggas 12 ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me, now quit talkin to me
Can I vet? All you niggas sound retarded to me
Killin these niggas, I'm a general nigga
Turn yo head to target for free
Now I'm on, look at me
Started, started with them pesos and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood niggas gotta know that that's all me
See the set catch rap

Move to back to Compton shit, we are too

Livin down the street where BIG got shot, I hunt you

It's how we live our life, surrounded by Che, pause

Where the angels fly, city of angels' I will never let you down
Kill anything approaching my crown
Still undefeated
That's why I got my kids building sand castles on the beaches
But don't get it confused, said he still got moves
Where the wrong colors niggas end up on the news like Sal
Like Durant in a dream then I'm right back down Compton avenue in a Buick
If you had the hot niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king would you do it?

Our experience to where we have parents in our lives that were showing us everything, like didn't nobody walk us, our hand and show love like you do this and don't do that. It wasn't like that coming up in our mothafuckin' community. We grew up off of cigarillos... we grew up off of second row, acting like them. A worldwide blade, a real strength....

Yeah that's on the regular
Smokin' the gas on the regular, man
Word
Sippin' on Hen, that's the regular

Pissy sofas, sharin' food with roaches, uh
I'm gangsta, Crip, my poppa was a bitch
Left me where hopeless don't exist
And every neighbor got a fence
With bars and windows, my mom's slavin' for the rent
Throwin' dices, GT dyno pool
Where you hang, we shootin'
You slip, we stiffin'
Creative Crippin', uh
Bitches stoppin' traffic
This the type of shit that make the MAC a classic
Reason I'm a pussy magnet
She learned to carry package
Been the best at rappin', uh
Am I this Vegas?
Your favorite rapper broke, he don't get this paper
But claim he got a kilo, been born in '93 though
He tryna fool the people
Maaaaaan

[Kendrick Lamar:]
The joke's on you, mothafucka
The loc is on you, mothafucka
I warned you, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma
Black thoughts and marijuana, it's karma

Ain't nothin' changed but the change
Let's put our brains away from gangs
Crips and Bloods the old and new slaves
Shit we even changed our names
Trying something, new shame while we bang
But yo, y'all ain't hearin' me
My homie facin' life, told me that my pride my biggest enemy
But... you keep your eyes in that dark
Your mind, it greys your heart
I wrote these rhymes days apart
Most of us caught before we can expand our thoughts
How your grandmother see your corpse?
How your big homie make your life a book?
Left you for dead cause he ain't need you, right
But I'm gon' fade him, right
Let's put the rags down and raise our kids
Let's put the guns down and blaze a spliff
Let's do it now, ain't no buts or ifs
It took a Blood to get me Pringle chips
You can learn to fly or take the ladder
Real nigga shit, all lives matter, both sides
Man

Exactly what I'mma have when the cops come
Body languages, the same as when the shots rung
Hole in a thirty-eight and a shotgun
Real nigga, we all know you are not one, nah
Running with the rebels, it's a three-man weave
With the Lord and the devil
Really all I need is a pitchfork and a shovel
If I can't proceed then I resort to the metal (Blank face)
Getting high watching NBA League Pass (Who with?)

Came from the dirt to the carrots
Getting dirty dollars
Fuck different baby mommas
Dope between the speakers
So fuck you mister teacher
Cause the paper, I ace it
Lead, they tried to erase it
But I'm still standing
They mad at everything
Nothing given, I'mma take it first
On the trees like a hammock
Flip the work behind the campus
Young Ruby, turn your hood into a movie (into a movie...)
Gang bang it, don't slang it
GTA-ing, shoot the whole club up
Fuck tryna sneak the K in
On the road to riches
Thank you Mister Reagan
You helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that hooked up the family
That shit that you was smokin'
I was pushin' residue like on the cushion
I'mma blame it on your ass cause I ain't gettin' whoopings
And your proof is in the pudding
I'm his grandma's baby, Eddie Kane

Standing in the white light and we on
And we on
And is there any other smokers in here?

And don't be blind to see my love is the punch you shouldn't fear
Say words can't express what you do for me when you appear
And don't be blind to see my love is the punch you shouldn't fear

And I can't afford to lose
Say girl jump in my bank account
So I can deposit you
I'm goin' through withdraws
And I can't afford to lose

Plasma my TV screen
Hope I go out like BB King
The front row, they cheer for God

Thinkin' 'bout you in the worst way
I need your cake like it's your birthday
I'm tryna be in front the TIME page
Yeah she rockin' with the big dog

Little lettuce, slice of cheese, sucka please

[Swizz Beatz:]
Preacher told me don't set trip on a Sunday
Knowin' damn well that there'll get you laid Monday

Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Na-na-na na-na na-na

Never, ever ever get caught tellin' on my niggas
I'm a gangbanger, deadbeat father and drug dealer
When the money and fame gone, tell me who stayin' with you
Runnin' from God's creation
Shakin' these broken hands and meetin' with blank faces
Snake eyes keepin' my back achin'
Dirty habits of rappin' and bein' savage
Still hangin' with niggas that can't do nothin' but cause damage
Guess I'm bein' a real nigga like I'm 'posed to be
But bein' real never once bought the groceries and
Top told me keep rappin', you'll make it hopefully
And hope was all that I needed, dreamin' myself to work
This workin' affair was better than bullet holes in my shirt
The demons hate when you make it and stay alive
They'd rather see me down under than see me fly
Lord have mercy!

[Swizz Beatz:]
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy
Lord have mercy
Please Heaven's mercy

They say I was a wanted man, a wanted man
Runnin' with my gun in hand, gun in hand
They don't wanna see the wanted man, the wanted man
Comin' through with the gun in hand, the gun in hand
Damn
Lord have mercy


Hoes ain't callin'
The cocaine rock
World keep spinnin'
The block stay hot
The block stay hot
The block stay hot
World keep spinnin'

Thank God for the game
My TV screen off the chain
My bitch, she off the chain
I came from the grain
The sidewalk chalk
The block stay hot
Paranoid, the cop that keep my gear in park
Pull me out the car to give me black thought
But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player
This shit my mama flavor
This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now & Laters
Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor
Grew up just like your daddy
Packin' baggies in alleys
To where the streets is your family
Gettin' blurred by the same cop
Go to jail for a year and come home
Two of your niggas dropped
You know how that feelin' feel
What to feel when it's gettin' real
More bullets to go around
Come jump in this water, nigga
You still with your mama livin'
30 with no ambition
Your kid got no pot to piss in
You sayin' some nigga fake
You're selfish and sad, nigga
You're lame
And go on...
You hatin' on another man's success
Because the nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse
You got the game all twisted
You're leechin' worse than these ladies
Your inner nigga ain't aging
Reason the hood stay shady

[SZA:]
Who you do when you want?
Boy think you got this
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Hoes ain't callin' like you want
Only ones you got passed
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?

Hoes ain't callin'
The cocaine rock
World keep spinnin'
The block stay hot

Really with it forreal
We fuckin' hoes forreal
Gettin' paper forreal, nigga
I play for the bills, nigga
I really sold pills
Smokin' weed for my ills
Breakin' weed in my whip
Just got an ounch on a bitch
Still our motive be commas
And still my life isn't promised
Still nervous as drivers
You see them lights get behind us
They pull me out for my priors
Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire
You say that footage a liar
They want my flow in the dryer
I'm at the top aimin' higher
My lawyers stay on retainer
When white folks point the finger
Place my neck on that hanger
Shit, no wonder we riot
Niggas still killin' niggas
Child support killin' niggas
Cops enslavin' us niggas
Little girls killin' mothers
They treat their kid like a brotha
Fathers stuck with them lifers
Kept it real with his niggas
But left his kid for the sucks
Shit no wonder we bang
Damn shame, mane, some things will never change

[SZA:]
Who you do when you want?
Boy think you got this
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?
Hoes ain't callin' like you want
Only ones you got passed
No one here, on your own
Stuck in the same spot
What do you do? What do you do?

Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper like
Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah I'm baller like
Bitch I think I'm Dolamite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist
You said this is overnight, album four is really like
Crippin' on my minibike
Either hoop or sellin' white
Brillo pad, the smoker's pipe
My pistol cocked, you tryna fight?
Say he wanna be a cuz, put his brains to the right
Bruh, this ain't the eighties, mane
Niggas shootin' everything, everything
You know the gang we represent
Specialize in pistol grips
Shootin' out my momma's whip
Always got an empty clip
Top Dawg in this bitch
Nigga's puttin' dicks inside your baby momma's momma's lips
Shootin' all the witnesses, it ain't no fuckin' murder scene
Crips don't fuck with Crips oh now it's jeans that look like the rival team
Wrong hat and shoes, put your ass on the forever dream
Heatin' up the summer 'til the winter fall, spring clean

Ride out, big smoke
Re-up, big dope
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, big smoke
Re-up, big dope
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper like

You said this was overnight, me and Vince, we crackin' like
Crippin' in our afterlife

[Vince Staples:]
Yeah, cause at Ramona Park we beef with everybody
Light or dark I'll spark, don't fuck with narcs
So don't be talkin' 'bout me
My big homie made me get 'em, kill 'em
Cause if I got 'em I'ma kill 'em, I ain't playin' with 'em
I'm from the bottom, that's the top of the town
We on the [?] so they clip us up for knockin' 'em down
My burner tucked, I learned from Chuck so I ain't turnin' it down
Get to bussin', know you bluffed it, nigga
If that bitch can't make me rich then ain't no need in fuckin' with her
Turn around and fuck her sister
Heard that bitch, got EBT
Long Beach ain't seen shit like me
Since Tracy D and DPG I went and got a burner
On the day they murdered Baby D
That ain't murder baby, heat
I'm in that Benz with Lil Boy
So lil boy don't play with me

I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street, my knuckles full of teeth
Try to creep on me, you're dyin' in your homie's seat
Keep to my gun and reach
Filet the beef, clip reach from Fig side to Norfolk Beach
In a stolen Expedition, in your hood cause you the mission
Been a mathematician, load nine, subtracted eight
I'm keepin' one for just in case, don't cover face but I ain't trippin'
Blunt was laced, niggas know I'm 'round the way
So ain't no liquor stores today

Ride out, big smoke
Re-up, big dope
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed
Ride out, big smoke
Re-up, big dope
Gs up, hoes blow
Freeze up, eyes closed

Young nigga and I'm proper like

Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride
Ride, ride, ride, ride


Figured that I gotta sell dope, or the money won't grow
Figured I was Too Short, and I could never turn pro
You could tell I never had shit, but bet I get that 80 grand wrist
Told me we could never get rich
Now watch me ride the Chevy hit the switch
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Aye, riding through the city on chrome
Ghetto nigga out the sunroof, hey, foreign keys bitch please
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Flossin' in the mind, stuntin' like the first, shufflin' the work
Uh, I done came from the dirt
Now the engine make the tire go skrrt
Used to sleep with roaches cracky uncle and all
Now a hundred thousand just a hour involved
So easy how I make a mill' flip
Snoop ain't the only rich crip, nigga
From sleepin' on Tops couch to multiple bank accounts
To havin' me a mall for house
They tried to slim my chances as kid though
They always said I'd never make it big though
Straight ballin' like a bitch

[Jesse Rankins and ScHoolboy Q:]
Picture me rollin', ooh
Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Picture me rollin', ooh, yea
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high
Yeah, so high, so high

Straight ballin' like a bitch

So high
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Straight ballin' like a bitch

Aye, wait, waitin' on my turn to get paid
Nigga trying to make a mill' a day
Put that rental on in the interstate
Since a youngin' I was gifted
Momma bought me some things for the bitches
Bruh, I go through some things you gotta witness
Stomach get to mumblin' at night
Watchin' every car that drive by, lookin' every driver in the eye
52nd enterprise, marchin' in these Chucks like they boots
Money make a pussy get the juice
Money make the copper give a pass
Money make me cop a bigger roof
Money got me skippin' every class
Tryna kill 'em for the summer
The teachers ain't teachin', the judge taught us numbers
We was raised by single mothers
Pop once took us undercover
Through the streets we learned colors
Hiding from the reaper tryna' dodge the cage
This shit I've done to rhyme on this stage
I went from king of the corner
To breaking down weed on my diploma
Straight ballin' like a bitch

[Jesse Rankins and ScHoolboy Q:]
Picture me rollin', ooh
Straight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky
Straight ballin' like a bitch
Picture me rollin', ooh, yea
I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high

Gang, gang bangin' that Crip shit

Niggas said cause in the first grade
In the shade where the cops can't see us
Eighteen, tryna dodge the cage
It was cool 'til that gang sweep
Now I'm in the back of a van
And my wrists got a band
Got a number for a name
No name on the Visa, no card get accepted
Now I'm forced to a man
Murder raps, where you from?
Put the nigga on his pockets
Watch the COs, they be watchin'
County news for the hustle
County spread for the muscle
Couple marks on my knuckles
Put niggas on bum status
Shoulda been with the bitch ass
Now he on a mattress, double bench press
PC, get the Fruit Loops
Keep tellin' on niggas
Why I fuck with that nigga?
Nigga made bail but I'm still at rage
Should I thank God for the hell I raised?
Cause the nigga that snitch is gonna feel that grave
Ain't nothin' to a locc, huh?
Went missin' to his folks, I ain't in, I ain't know, huh?
They ain't show up to the court, huh?
But then charges gotta go, huh?
A young nigga back on Fig
H-crown on wig
Shoe strings say where I'm from
On probation and got my gun
Other side goin' for that thumb
Motherfucker I'm gangbanging

Getting it in and movin' it out
Getting it in and movin' it out

Fiends keep comin', this shit don't stop
When it's war time, niggas get popped
We might die for this shit off tops

Money got niggas lookin' at me all odd
Punk ass niggas better go get a job

[ScHoolboy Q + Anderson .Paak:]
Blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face
Blank face, blank face, blank face, blank face
Blank face, blank face
I'll trade the noise for a piece of divine
Uh!

This that "Fuck the blogs"
The afterbell, we hang in halls
Underage, smokin' weed and alcohol
Grandma sweeped shells out the driveway
One of the homies got slayed so we bang at the King parade
I can take you spots where gangsters walk
The real damus and locs, Boyz N the Hood wasn't even close
Where the girls' kitten show, hit the dope and the pussy soaked
Now she get you for your change, Captain Save-A-Hoe, mane
I ain't been right since out the cervix
I know a M can make it perfect
It came through more than the one I worship
You I never lie, the truth be told, the dope, it gettin' sold
He got the runny nose
Summertime, we don't trust niggas in winter clothes
I swear the hood low, as the burner get rolls I follow the city codes
My money short
Missin' the days of honey oats
Dollar bills in mama's coat
Cartoons and bubble soap
This be the realest shit I wrote
This be that ride that hunnid spoke
Red and blue from head to toe

Who needs a mothafuckin' friend?
You see them mothafuckin' rims
Met the devil in disguise
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes

[Anderson .Paak:]
Look at my eyes, look at my block
Look at my shit, cold
Bustin' these nines, true to my life
Word to my pen so
Take what you want, get what you like
Open that window
That shit raw
Ain't it? That shit raw
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes
Vision impaired by the high
No cares on my mind
Couple dares, that is fine

This shit from 'round the back house
More baggies bagged and that roach
In granny's plastic suede couch
Best play cat and that mouse
A minor pitchin' in major
Stay servin' dope but we cater
Take you back to my sega
Slammin' bones on that table
Runnin' errands for grams, the paramedics at Tam's
Forced to grow to a man
Before L.A. had them Rams
Went to school for the bitches, where scorin' drugs was the goal
Lungs black as a crow, got banned from every hood store
My haters came for the better and money came for the loads
Concrete where we rose, you wasn't built from this mold
Fucked up the game with many flow
I've been a loc since Henry O
I'm ten toes, you movie role
I do this shit for lifers way before
Jehri curls, cut Dickies and sherm smoke
Got so many bodies the world knows, shit
Don't worry 'bout no witness, your homies go under oath
But our dreams were big, homie
The world done flipped on me, took my soul then clicked on me

Who needs a mothafuckin' friend?
You see them mothafuckin' rims
Met the devil in disguise
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes

[Anderson .Paak:]
Look at my eyes, look at my block
Look at my shit, cold
Bustin' these nines, true to my life
Word to my pen so
Take what you want, get what you like
Open that window
That shit raw
Ain't it? That shit raw
Look through my mothafuckin' eyes
Vision impaired by the high
No cares on my mind
Couple dares, that is fine

My picture was in full frame
But my vision had distort
My memory is okay
But my feelings on point
I could be here all day if you let me go, go, go, go
Oh lord!
You don't know the half of what I had to hold, hold, hold, hold
No lord!
I see faces at my window
My patience growin' short
I had no one to lend on
That's why that chip is so cold
Kinda like the cool king on my fallen bros
Oh lord!
Guess that's my curtain call, my last go
Ain't this shit what you wanted to see?
Ain't this shit what you wanted to see?


[Candice Pillay + ScHoolboy Q:]
Now it's time to make our mind, oh babe
I don't feel a thing
You got the right one, 2 step
Can I rock with ya? Can I smoke with ya?

Tryna give you an upgrade
Cherry bottles to your shapes
Take my debit and go cray
Spend, spend every dollar, all way
Turn your closet to a driveway
Your old nigga was the old days
Broke times in a broke place
Teary eyed with the pout face
You can get it how you want it, my love
Small shoppin', hope a hundred thousand enough
Benz, Benz, want the rims on the truck
Girl you livin' a no, stay in the goat
Whatever you want

[ScHoolboy Q + Candice Pillay:]
Hey! Cribbo in the Hills
Table full of bills
Dollar dollar bills

Fly around the world, girl you livin' or not?
We used to run from the cops, now we buyin' the blocks
Started ballin' like I said I would
Came up in the game I love
If you backed it you must get cuffed
So cold with the cobra love
Now I'm never in the hood enough
Had to get up off my ass to get it
Want it, pick it, tag, clip it, yeah

[Candice Pillay:]
West coast, Cali love, you can have it all
Palm trees, bomb weed, whatever you want
Middle age millionaire, you can have it all
Sleeve gold, bankroll, whatever you want

[ScHoolboy Q + Candice Pillay:]

Diamonds last forever, baby
Look at what we got
I don't want your money, darling
I just want your love


[SchoolBoy Q - Verse 1]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with them instead
Turn it up and here the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but ima shoota'
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised
Yeah kudos
Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez

Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[SchoolBoy Q - Verse 2]
Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl said she feeling lone
I can't tell its over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah shoot ya'
Get a couple wipps, yeah kunta
Schoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas turn to shark over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys, yeah nigga birds and the beez

Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

[Kendrick Lamar]
Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living lime light
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga I would sacrifice my self to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set but its hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death, like a cracker would like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck

Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids

My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love but that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat, know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red bill, choose now, birds or the beez

Birds or the beez
Birds or the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

Count my change
Count my change


[Intro:]

I said Run dum dum, keep it bussin' every day yo

[Verse 1:]
Four Four with the nose leakin', still workin
Back up in this bitch like a lab surgeon
Fired up, leave a snitch nigga wide if he wired up
Yeah, huh, Jaw shut
Pool butts
Ran to the bread but only got crusts
So me grindin' with that iron is a real must
And it will bust, trust
So hush little boy hush
It's a man's world
You can go and keep it jerkin do your dance girl
I'm a cold nigga
Street entrepreneur trying to gain figures
Huh, plus I heard you was a lame nigga
Nah nigga, no need to explain nigga
First off see you never did your thing nigga
Looked up in the year book and seen you was the same nigga
Take you back to as a child
Where you was runnin from the same niggas that is bustas now
So you drink to sterilize your pain
And you never sober, should of been a soldier

[Hook:]
Up jumps the boogie to the bang bang boogie not another nigga fuckin' with me
I go upside your head, leave a mother fucker dead and I dare an eye witness to see
I got me something and it do somethin' sweet
Acting retarded nigga my cup of tea

[Verse 2:]
Bang Pop niggas sling rocks like a sling shot
Call my bitch China White, all she do is bang cock
Still with the same Glock, like I never heard cops
Fuck police tattoo's
50 niggas serve got
Beanie down, Blacked up
Every niggas strapped up
And we all tryna prove somethin'
Move somethin'
Fool nothin' all you niggas dead frontin'
Be politicking' never beyond dumbin'
Straight gunnin'
Huh? Yeah, So whats crackalackin'?
Look into a nigga eyes you know whats 'bout to happen
Back in action, flip the money like gymnastics
Wrapped in plastic, Fantastic
Yeah
Make the soda pop you niggas smell the odor
Coca cola, heard it's cheaper in the Nolia
So do the Nolia Clap
Where them birds at?
Just know I'm here for business though
See I serve rats
Yeah, make sure nigga heard that
Seen as he hit the back his ass getting whacked (BLAT)
Yeah, and it's on to the next one
Gone to the next onw
Flyer than a Jetson
You knowin' Ima get it in
Playin with the heat you should have gave it to your niggas then
Shots jump, roping out the Glock
Smoking like a double dutch
Too much

[Hook]


[ScHoolboy Q]
Hold and shoot till he drop
We'll be waiting for you around the corner, nigga

Only twelve and a half, and already ducking them jabs
Fighting back, just hoping that he last, he on his ass
Huffing and puffing, getting tagged
See what this nigga feel would only make them niggas laugh
He felt the discomfort, didn't trust him right away
Saw the Devil in they eyes, his homie looking straight
But something was different in him, not the same from yesterday
Shit, his whole demeanor changed, even his smile was strange, his childhood never came
But dude was always gutter, he got it from his brother
From his brother, from his brother, brought pain onto his mother
Once was elementary homies, but now we attack each other
Shit, set love aside, tuck his pride, shit, he had to ride
Threw on his hood and then he fired, fired and fired
Fired and fired, the tires screech
Spirit up out of reach
A young nigga swallowing yeast, trapped in the belly of the beast, sheesh

[Chorus 2X]
I know niggas that kill niggas, that kill niggas
that kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues
The cycle continues (kill nigga, kill nigga)

[ScHoolboy Q]
He only seventeen, his homies was his motive
He only seventeen, his mama never noticed
Too busy paying bills, tryna provide a meal
Pay the rent and steal, her child live for a thrill
Fulfill his niggas' wishes, no more hugs or kisses
No more 'how you been?', no more tucking in
He with them other men, poppa never came
So his cousin then would pretend, imitating if they was him
Got the pistol on him loaded, loaded off of gin
Feels like niggas on him, so he look for them
First nigga wrong, hack! Blam blam to him
Paranoia kills, kill or be killed
Let alone all them thugs, let alone all them drugs
Treat is kinda like a bud, let's see how karma does
Let's see how much he loves shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up, bam, bam

[Chorus 2X]

[ScHoolboy Q]
This nigga twenty-one, he feel like he the man
This nigga twenty-one, his mom said be a man
Love to sag his pants, pistol in his hand
Feel he too advanced, him slipping out his chance
Think he at his best, he hit the set, he making orders
Got them lil' niggas busting shots and flipping quarters
An ounce a half, double up, shit, what you order?
Even dimes think with a corrupted mind
Adapted to the crime, living with regrets
In order to survive gotta get high
Cautious with time, paranoia all through his body
Trying love for a hobby, you know gangsters come with kids
Teaching them wasn't his
EBT, the corner store, he go to fill up the fridge
Approached by a little nigga, hoodie over his lid
Looked down the barrel of a burner tucked, aimed at his wig
Let him fire, then he fired, fired

[Chorus 2X]


[V1 - Schoolboy:]
Got the baddest hoes
Got the finest weed
Everywhere I goes
They know who I be
Now take a picture
Now let me be
Let me do me, let me be a fiend
I'm shootin' up, everyday I'm tryna ball
With my little China doll, got my back like spinal cord
That pistol on me, yeah that .45
Nigga feelin' do or die, fuck tryna be unified
She over there
Wanna be over here
So I pull her hair, fuck her from the rear until she there
How are you?
Shit, I go by Q
Heyyy hoooo, now what it do?
Got a king size and it's built for 2
I been meaning, to be leaning up in that pussy like promethazine and she took the semen my willy beamin'
On any given Sunday that pussy a runway she did it the fun way
Smash it like, Ticante
She did me hombre no need for nombre
We screamin' olÃ© and olÃ© we scored no goalie, she's just a groupie
And group-a, gave top like toupÃ©e, bum rushed that coochie
Her pussy lukewarm like long lay, her head be Bombay
Like gin and OJ, took a shot, and I won like gameday
Yes I'm the sensei, comprende?
Got a ticket, one way
Oh you don't really see it that I'm gone?
Pass the baton, black
Real rap, spit to the break of the dawn, nigga we all that
We all that, see that's the shit that we be on
Nigga this Black Hippy, nothing else
Beat so bake I'm 'bout to melt
All my shit be prison felt, TDE we got the belt
Hold it down if nothing else
Swear to god, on my life
Where it's at? Shit on sight
Down to ride, fuck a bike
If I'm locked then fly a kite
Keep a strap on like a dyke
TDE we got the belt
Hold it down if nothing else

[V2 - Ab-Soul:]
Quincy where the weed at? You know I really need that
You know we go back, memba when I had you smokin' Blacks?
In the back when Top was gone now Top is back
That mean we in Juice garage
You know you my brethren, we superstars
Still mobbin' the 7/11, fuck a car
Top Dawg, ya little fists ain't up to par
Got the baddest hoes, burn the finest kush
That means I'm a botanist slash gynecologist
Please hold your apologies for sleepin' it was prophecy
I just need some time to have these demons climb up out of me
You know the ones that got me sippin' these mickeys till I'm numb
Having your Mrs' tongue missing from her mouth, in around my nuts
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of dust bunnies
This hip hop ain't done none for me
Knew I was to be a star when I had a cubby, watching Ferngully
Now everything I puff fluffy and I'm so comfy
Watch the company I keep place they come for me
All these bitches in your dreams drinking cum from me
This blue dream steaming the lungs of me
Oh buddy
Soul!


We can have a rendezvous
Butter on your crip legs, dinner for two
I know you're used to niggas running game
But I ain't playing games
Trying to introduce you to my last name
Let's get acquainted
Let me be your fiend, you be my nicotine
I'm about to take a hit, shit
Damn, start a fam
Take you to the crib, show you how I live
Need you by my side, you could be my rib
Your friends messy, baby, I could be your bib
Fool for your love, my pretty angel, you came from above
My little ghetto dove
Hold me down and I could take us up

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
You that nigga
You that nigga
Real go-getter
And I'm that bitch, so you better come get her
[2x]

She wonder where we're going next
Want a rider if you know what's best
I can be your iron knight and you I will protect
Inhale your love and let our souls connect
Go deep inside
Steal your heart, take away your pride
Can see it in your eyes
The way a gangster got you smiling took you by surprise
Got me smiling too
No waiter, girl, you are the menu
My number one fan, you are the venue
Fuck show money, rather you're my revenue
Smoke a blunt or two
Gaze at the stars, keep us hypnotized
Reach for the sky, I could take you to the top
I hope you do comply

[Hook]

We can have a rendezvous
Butter on your crip legs, dinner for two
Later on, shit, let's see what it do
Been chasing you for a while, let's end the pursuit
Lock you down and throw away the key
My new life the only place for you to be
Glad you chose a G
I can be your dreams and fulfill your fantasy

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
The flow-- is in the pocket like wallets
I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alco-fuck that
Figg get da money, shootin dice what they hittin' for?
Hookers out to sell the pussy
Money trade for intercourse
Every corner, liquor store
Laundromat, liquor store, laundromat, liquor store
EBT accept 'em more
Churches 'cross from motels, Lord knows pussy sells
Churches 'cross from motels, Lord knows pussy sells
Domino's, Pizza Huts, Colt 45 cans, the old heads drunk enough
Dollar after dollar on lottery, that shit be addin' up
Schizos from Vietnam, better yet the drug era that used to be a ball player
See how things evolve later
4 Lokos for the young locos
Niggas cashin' my check for white tees
Don't fuck with Melrose, just Metros--PCS's
You get the message
Good investments in my direction

[Hook]
Figg get da money, yeah! [Repeat 4x]
Rain, sleet, snow, turn July into December, yeah!
Figg get da money, yeah! [Repeat 6x]
Springtime fall turn summer to a winter, yeah!
Figg get da money, yeah! [Repeat 2x]

[Verse 2:]
Uh, it's midnight, where the bitches at (Schoolboy)
See a ho, pimp a ho, put her on the track (Schoolboy)
Put her in the gas station, hiding from the white and black (Schoolboy)
They gotta make a living so they put us on our back (Schoolboy)
But why they gotta judge us when we do it back? (Schoolboy)
Mickey D's and Burger King still make sure that my daughter fat (Schoolboy)
Close to Christmas on November, best believe I got a jack (Schoolboy)
Been coming to this store for years, the cops come behind me 'bout a snack [?]
But thanks Ms. Han, Jackie Chan, Sake bomb (Schoolboy)
Any Catholic differ-an, Wolverine like Michigan (Schoolboy)
Wolver Street know what it be (Be)
Hanging in front of the laundry mat til 2 or 3 (3)
With like 2 or 3 (3)
Uh, everyone asleep so shall we creep
Money to gain up in them streets
Shall I preach about this beat
Puffy ain't got shit on me
Better yet this L.A. heat
Figueroa, figg sa money block

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Uh, Jehoviah coming let me close the blinds
So I can get high, nigga free my mind
Write my niggas doing hella years past time
Ballers got it crackin', crackin' at the crack of dawn
Ice cream truck stop for my mom but me, he won't respond
Gotta read between the lines
Best believe I'm off of crime
This must be the longest line, where they cookin' worse than swine
Lying on their letter signs, but hurry cause they close at 9
But Pices got it jumpin' at the taco stand
Rapping on them corners (Aye!), AM, PM like the Taliban
Camping out, your daddy selling money he can understand
Drizzle riding through the hood, Junkies love the avalanche
Homeless person gotta shuffle cans, take 'em up to the recycle bin
Take his bread to the candyman, but still he eat
Tell me if that ain't hustlin'
Rain, sleet, snow, hell and shit uhhh, Hell!

[Repeat Hook]


[Verse 1:]
Everytime that I wake up, I swear I'm never down
Even when I'm in my dreams, I'm high off self esteem
Blowin' on that Jamaica my niggas love the team, marijuana fiend
Keep your Black N Milds and cigs cuz me no nicotine
I keep my pimpin' mean
Me and Musa as we pulled up on them sixes just to go and bust some bitches
See them motherfuckin' wheels, sex appeal
And if I'm in the backseat with them tints, that Glock concealed
They eye us as we peel like the, orange hat that I be stylin' in
Like a zanny or a klonopin
All your swishers, they be model thin
We plus size, nigga!
Like Tocarra and them, shining like a halogen
So bright, like highbeams, headlights and midnight
That one of Rhode Island's watchtower sights
Yeahh, the world is all I need
But if you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Chorus]
Bet I got some weed
[x2]
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
[x2]
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
[x6]

[Verse 2:]
Let's go chill up on my balcony and feel the breeze
Open up a corona and see who got some weed
If we don't have no trees then let's gather up the fees
Hundred dollars, that's a seventh of the sour D
Make a order it'll be here a quarter to three
Smoke it till we on E
Then we fill up again with another 10
Then we just go run back to the cheese to fill our, family needs
No a rease, smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of 3's
We dyin' up in every plea
So for ya'll my niggas swear to god my heart will bleed
Kick the shit for my lifers and ones who kickin' seas
Even if it's just 5 dollars keep your brain on free
Elevate your mind cuz in due time you wine and dine
Something fine in that
Kush blunts soon be your valentine and my shit be Columbine
My friends is all I need
But If you don't know anything just know I got some weed

[Chorus]
Bet I got some weed
[x2]
You don't know anything? Just know I got some weed
Bet I got some weed
[x2]
Ain't got no money mayne, but bet I got some weed
Hey, who got some weed?
Who got some weed?
[x6]

[shout outs till the end]


[ScHoolboy Q]
As a younger age, never really gave a shit
Just my grandma arms, kept me out of harm
Nigga went to class, my football pass
Kept the burner stashed, they ain't gon' catch my ass
In the Pontiac with the bad speakers
Back then? Shit, I was into sneakers
and fitted caps, side kicks
My same bitch, she a down bitch
Had a little daughter, glad it ain't a boy
Knew she'd bring me joy, so I named her Joy
Kiss her on her head, then I kiss her lips
Then I kiss her cheek, lay her down to sleep
Trials and tribulations helped me through my situations
Little observations stopped the cops from confrontations
And the ghetto bird, and a nigga snitched
But I'm still dipping, shit, I ain't tripping

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q over an incomprehensible sample (BJ the Chicago Kid)]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good...
(I know I'm not perfect
But I'll still make a decision that make my life still worth it, yea-ea-eahhh
And sometimes it may hurt
But I know what you see ain't what it's gon' be, cause I know my worth, yeeeaaahhhh...)

[ScHoolboy Q]
Got a lil' older, nigga seen a lot of shit
Been out in Boston, even got to see the Knicks
I've been to Dallas, slap a five with the bench
Back to the hood where niggas betting on the six
But shit is crazy
Lil' Teisha and Tamika bout to kill they babies
Pregnant at the same time, and they think that shit is cute
Always running from the truth, bigger dream they must pursue
And they babies wasn't in it
Just going bout they business in the club
She off of Guinness, adioses with the lemon
V.I.P. she dreams of, in the club looking for mean buzz
In a dress looking distinctive
[?] got that ass hanging with the biggest baller in the club
Ain't got a dub, but she want some love
Wasn't polite, but she feel it's right
Lay it down, then he dimmed the lights, played it right for the night

[Chorus]

[Punch]
Uh, ignorance is bliss, but to know is pain
No matter what we reap, we still sow the same
The concept of change is second-rate to change
Either way around, the cycle still remains
Out my project window, observing the wannabes blowing endo
Shooting dice on the corner, big homie roll up with his kinfolk
Unfold a stack on 'em like, what they hitting for?
Slamming the doors on his Benzo
He left the engine running, bumping something sounding like
late eighties R&B, trunk full of China white
Type of nigga ladies like, known dope dealer
Money, cash, hoes getter, slash stone cold killer
He can't sleep at night, his victim's eyes piercing through his soul
He wake up every time his eyes close
That's who them young boys aspire to see
Underneath the palm trees, that's who they dying to be
But I'm good

[Chorus]


[Intro:]
Gun me down, I'll gun you down
Trade a body for a body
Nigga kamikaze

[Verse 1:]
Tired of living no healthcare, I ain't fucking with wellfare
But its rap down, Hells near, Sherm on every corner like fountains near
G rock, mountaineer, chunk coats a cop would wear, double up, roca wear
Win or lose, none to spare, black jack safety pair
20 rounds one to the head, whole clip strike the beard
Breaking news fuck the feds, buckle up, simon says
Do the job nothing says, neighbors seen this shit for years
Hopped out, out of range, close up not a stain
Gut shot got him maimed, shit bag potty trained

[Hook:]
No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record
And I'm playing shit for what its gonna be
A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50
And my bitch and she ridin' on E
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze

[Verse 2:]
Nigga welcome to Hell's kitchen, prayers missing
Doing good has no intentions, with the shit that I'm kicking
Heavens too far from forgiving
Stuck on a mission, Choppers by the windows
See the silhouettes, just like I'm heading fishing
Pay your rent or meet your soul's eviction, greet the reaper
Deliver death like serving pizza, dome piece the shell cracked like Sunday Easter
Feel this Ether, the pyromaniac, you niggas keisters
Ain't shit but ass, newest task is getting cash
Smoking hash and let it ash, off a dime like Steve Nash
22 by my lower calf, see a hawk, we sqeeze and blast
(Hahaha) Fucking laugh, shady more than aftermath
Eminem's my limit slim, we ain't the same no synonym
No sin in them, get it in like lucifer, down and dirty emperor
With hell's demons and angels, rat-a-tat-tat-tat sent for ya
I major in your minisher, left his ass holy by the minister
Immortal Kombat finisher

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, a nigga got smoked
The killers name remains silent
Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, there's guns in the streets
I know the governments supplying
Prison wars, race riot, ice pick in the neck, flatline
Another comic grave for man kind
Every step I take a land mine, blowin' up like 9-11, Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor
Afghan hobbies, got me feelin' Kamikaze (KABOOM) blow up the party
Sickest lad-i-dadi,peace on Earth you dont remind me
Dying Honor, Uni-bomber, you pre-madonna, I'm ghetto verson of Gia Connor
Mob bosses, count losses gain profits, same logic
Did it all but still stay silent, keep the gangster grooving in my blood cuz'
50's who I do it for, die for mine and ride on yours

[Hook]


[ScHoolboy Q]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, the ground rising, the sun falling
My day is cool, my night's yawning {yawns}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy, I'm taking flight
Uh, yeah, NASA left behind
I'm so beyond, somewhere with Megatron
I'm super gone, you can't relate to him
and ummm, let me free my mind
Ooooh, I see it all
The galaxy, she want my all
Uh, feel like it's child's play
Dive through a Milky Way, fulfill my destiny
As I cooperate, I record plays
My record spins, nigga whirlwind
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
See you in the morning, take off nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky-high
Going-going-going up there nigga, I'm time-zoning
Tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high, nigga I'm sky high
See you in the morning, going-going-going

[ScHoolboy Q]
The ground rising, the moon falling
My night's cool, my day's yawning {yawns}
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but
move at the speed of light, ayyy
We travel like a comet, supersonic, just watch out when I accelerate
Moving at the speed of light, ain't no thoughts of me using brakes
Uh, inhaling gravity, excelling Hubble
Check my levels, check my levels, turn me up, turn me up
What the fuck? Got your bitch, she on my nuts, on my nuts
all because a nigga cool, man I swear she act a fool
Man you know I keep it real, man for reals
Man you know I'm super-ills, went to Pluto, gave it chills
Man I swear there no appeals, rising from my heels
with no ceiling over ground, probably never coming down
Yeah, I see it all
Become a star, tryna shine through the fall, aw

[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbo boosting, my jet pack cruising
Get jet lag when I come back to these fucking humans
I can put planet Earth in a canister
then continue my crater search with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seeing signs
You hearing signals deciphered from District 9
No fucking rapper cipher when meteors flying
The meters are flying, but I'm way faster
Run away, bet I catch up, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughing in spaceships, it's starships crashing
Hover above the masses, a massive attack when mixing
Kendrick Lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats
Niggas, wanna hope on tracks, bitches, wanna hop on dick, damn!
Is that a fucking blimp? No O-M-G that's him
A shooting star hanging over a new eclipse, hanging over a big dick
When my music flip, nigga I'm sky high, shit

[Chorus]


[Chorus: Alori Joh]
I feel like a phenomenon
Like I'm who these people idolize
And I won't let nothing get in my way
It ain't a thing, we do this all the time

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Got another one, twist another one, off that indo
That's my medicine, need a bigger lung
Fame going to my head, call it wisdom
Now I need racks, yeah, Wimbledon
This chewing gum, always hold ya tongue
Never spit it out, we finna miss like cobras huh
We soldiers huh, you noticed them
As the tales money flip, until the quota's done
Yeah, until my single come, be the Devil's son
Devil's work, getting work, Hallelujah
Hope the Lord alerts, do a soul search
Understand my heart's good, but my daughter's first
Black episode, my down time, needed church
Precious life what my style is worth
Won't gain, let my shit assert
Move on!

[Hook:]
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
All the time

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
And I'm still up, never gave a damn, never gave a fuck
All my real niggas, we gon' stay in touch
Even out of range, nigga do your thang
You know where I'm at, just holla back
Where that cash at? Nigga flashback
Nigga sixteen? A dope sack
A sixteen? Stretch that
Double that, yeah, flip that
Big steps, work hard
Big yards, slanging footballs
Have 'em running back, receivers serving corners
It's taken by the pushers, burners eyes and lookers
Yeah, yeah, yeah, now see we gotta make it
We ain't trying to brick, unless we cop a brick
Accompanied by the razors, you know the shit
I make it easy, ain't this bout a bitch?
Move on!

[Hook:]
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
All the time

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Said I can't lose, nigga gotta win
Future looking bright, Thomas Edison
Here we go again
Music always kept me calm, nigga ritalin
Always got it done, you a middleman
Contraband, yo we get it in
You are inelegant, my niggas looking militant
Dope boys, what you know about it?
You just know about it
A nigga sky high, boy, fuck a pilot
Microwave it fast boy, fuck a pilot
Yeah, hold it silence, keep your mouth closed
The game is to be sold not to be told, you like a ho
Matter like a auction, gave it to the best bidder
Lucky I didn't rob you, why your ass bitter?
I'm that nigga, better ask nigga
You was a phase, I outlast niggas
Move on!

[Hook:]
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
We do this all the time
All the time


[Ab-Soul]
Drugs and girls
Uh, show me some love, my love
Last time I checked, you loved my love
Placed nothing above my love
If you leave, come back, like above your butt
No ifs, ands or buts
Yes I'm fishing, but I still wanna fill you up
"When the love runs high"
Hah, just when you thought enough was enough
I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty

[Kendrick Lamar]
Hoe, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers
All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi
Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
I wanna touch up and down your spine
"When the love runs high"
Hmm, a perfect ten living on cloud nine

[Chorus]
I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time
Anything that can get me out of my mind
I'm a rolling stone who needs another home
especially "when the love runs high"
(Now everybody in the place)
Tote, tote, tote, tote
Tote, tote, tote, tote
(Do it till you can't feel your face)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Everybody in the place)
Tote, tote, tote, tote
Tote, tote, tote, tote
(Do it till you can't feel your face)
Chug, chug, chug, chug
(Now stop, and just groove)

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, faded off life
See the dope man, time to get right
Uh, open up a Bud Light
Don Julio, Coronas, comas
Bad bitches, bad bitches
Calling bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness
Uh, "when the love runs high"
Pfft, whatever that mean
Uh, need a shot, you the vaccine
You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend
Uh, you're the crack
Uh, drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur

[Jay Rock]
Bend you over in a Rover, it's over
Never sober, my cup runneth over
"When the love runs high"
Better know girl, you fucking with a soldier

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Blunts and broads
Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God
Baby tryna grab my drawers
They call me Dozer, I knock down walls
Jose, that's my homie
He'll have you calling Earl in a hallway
"When the love runs high"
I gotta come down just to party
I'm turned up, maxed out
Willie Manchester, blow your back out
Baby girl, my advice, better back out
Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house

[Ab-Soul]
Listen ma, I got a role you can act out
and then like Prince' pants, get yo' ass out
I don't need a princess, I need a mistress
I'll stick a dick in a damsel in distress
'Soul!

[Chorus]


I got bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody fully loaded better watch your step
You keep running your mouth, or I'm hiding where you slept
Bet you be hog-tied and die for fucking with a red
Do this for my niggas, bet they say it's worth it
So I don't leave the studio not until it's perfect
Can't you see I'm grinding, can't you see I'm working
Down to give this motherfuck the life and that's for certain
Sipping on that lean, same color as Easter
This weed Halloween, hi It's nice to meet ya
Checking out my steelo, it's on another
Couple hundred kilo, spend it with my brother

[Hook x2:]
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it'sï»¿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set

I gotï»¿ money in my wallet, money in my pocket
Burner in my hand, so you better watch it
Bitch, I am the man tryna make a profit
Hope you understand, nigga what's ya logic?
Sagging in my jeans because I'm gutta
Fresh as Listerine, and still I'm gutta
Bitch I'm bout my paper, I'm bout that butter
Roll me up a blunt, time for another
Everybody paper chasin', working on a situation
Giving bitches penetration, Houston rocking, got it popping
Niggas like to catch a fade ever seen a nigga drop
Coup the wrap, pollute the block
Cock it back then shoot the cop
Flee the scene then get the cream
Then go split it with my team
Live my life and live it right
Shit I'm the homie with a mic
The homies out here ain't nice
Earn they stripes, serving white
Shaving coke, nigga what you living for?

[Hook x2]

Nigga finally on another page
Glock forty or the gauge (fade)
Hit a nigga with a blade, lay down, blocka
Then go around, blocka
Then another, take cover, black zip covers
Pass the deacon speakin', say the briefing
I know I left that nigga leaking
I know I coulda let him slide
But shit I'd rather slide a nigga
Forty-five a nigga
Shots will dive inside a nigga
Clean and sanitize a nigga
Smooth operator, Under-layer
Fast forward them shots and those who play us
Got love for my haters
And garcia Vegas
I put a dub in that it keeps my mind free of mazes
See my rhymes still amazes
Amazing ass nigga here to lick and pass nigga
Scheme ass on blast nigga
You say you doing bad, nigga what you lying for
Better get your chopper and then turn this bitch to Rambo
Meanwhile

Codeine, Xanax keep me tame but nothings like my mary jane

[Hook]


[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, go hard for the squad like, bam!
Spray with a stain on it (shit)
Flamed out the nozzle, at it full throttle
Acting hyena, black ninas
Uh, it's young niggas heating up Phoenix
Top Dawg familiar, crept with a Dillinger
in my fifth pocket, chump niggas stop it
Say you pressing who? Fuck around and get a tattoo
Have me dumping out the sunroof
Consequences you done ran through
Caught his ass slipping looking pretty in them sandals
Keep the gangster to the streets, you know the shit was handled
Ten speed, handle bar shit, Astro fit
Hopped off with a message in a clip
Inbox read (third verse), hitting till the third
I'll be back up on the curb, what's the word, word, word, word, word?

[Chorus: Ab-Soul (ScHoolboy Q)]
We continue to bring you
nothing but that true gang-
-ster shit you can move to, groove to, ooooh
(What's the word? What's the word? What's the word?)
We continue to bring you
nothing but that true shit, G shit

[Jay Rock]
Never had much, always had heart
Always had guts, I don't give a fuck
I ride like a bus, heavy with my flows
while my niggas in the spot, heavy with the blow
Plenty niggas broke, plenty homicides
Plenty mommas cry, yeah we wonder why
Stress on my thoughts, blowing weed out my jaws
Four-five niggas riding five deep in the car
Choppers in the trunk, choppers in the front
Catch a nigga slipping, then we taking what we want
Gang affiliated, a lot of niggas hating
cause a nigga red, steady beaming like a laser
Product of my environment, can't help where I came from
Watts, California where a nigga got his game from
Name from, what it do? Go ahead and blaze one
Be patient my nigga, we gon' ball when the day come
Disrespect the click, then I guess we gotta take one
Haters throw salt, so I guess we gotta shake something
I guess we gotta shake something
Haters throw salt, so I guess we gotta shake something
So what's the word?

[Chorus]

[ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, young 50, raw central kid
Macks near fucking lose your lip
Probably see me on Figg, 81 bus stop
Liquor stores and, hooker whores and, needle poison
Uh, everybody crooked
Lights out, shooting ranges, shit is dangerous
Keep your shoes tied motherfucker
Shit, it gets live motherfucker, shit's real
Get your ass trampled in the field
Youngin, should have let your muscle build
Broken jaws, and them stars be the evidence
Just another nigga tatted up upon my abdomen
Y'all squabbles, gang meetings, set functions
Have my shit bumping
Mid-central and Wayside stay jumping, we riding out
Middle finger, fuck the law, shoot they momma's house, hahah
That's the word

[Chorus]

[Ab-Soul]
G shit
G shit
G shit
We continue to bring you


[Intro]
Right, uh, same shit every day, homie
Lord please forgive me for all my sins
Yeah, nigga wake up to the same shit everyday, homie
Walking in the valley of the shadow of death
No rules, right

[Bridge]
Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

[Verse 1]
Uh, four corners, cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh, kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The 10 commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests from the cop raid
All can relate, from the streets to the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predictin' a heatwave, forecast your whole body
Heat on, room full of homi's, I just pray that the Lord got me

[Hook]
But if God don't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way
Mic check (La-la, la-la, low-low, la-la, la-la, low)
But if God won't help me, this gun will, I swear I'm gon' find my way

[Verse 2]
Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of Hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
We living to die, oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the ally, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, root for me
Out of shape belly, courtesy of 40
Spoiled only child, baby boy Jody
Same jacket on from back in the day
Praying that the Lord come and take me away

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
It go tuna fish sandwiches bread, dry snaking
Black Lincoln, burgundy Mac, I clap a king-pin
Caught me in the airport gust that I was thinkin'
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you
It's no problem at all, yo, the bunch on the pistol
Cause I'm a suit case king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
No wage bet, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round knife, fork, under the tents, coming to rents
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense
Revenge killers who make the events iller
This is more realer, snatch you right up out of the Benz
The Wu wheelers who huddle up, coupes knows the truth
You know the woopty-woop, solo or group I kill niggas


[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-by's at bedtime
Get down, I earn mine, so one loss they can't sign
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Hook]
So now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank, money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like la-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, now we 'bout to break the bank

[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swingin' for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, 20 year old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around boy
Tell Kendrick move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause Goddamn

[Bridge]
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy

[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doing, long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parlay, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her tempo, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Hook]

[Bridge]


Hop up out the bed, turn my swag on

Bread and butter, bacon eggs

Ca-ca-ca-californication
Cali-for-fornication, fornicating
[x4]

The illest gangsta, no debate, a natural you must concentrate
I came in this unorthodox with two left shoes, no matching socks
But now my Glock will never stop, and now my stomach always show

Come pull it out and kiss it ho, there he go

Rewind back it up no mistake, bitch come right on my hanky pank

And I'm more than a man, I'm a god bitch, touchÃ©, en garde
ToupÃ©e drop and her two tits pop, out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo Doo Doo Doo!" Bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this - I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this, and focus
And slow it down, alright, let me blow this bitch

Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics, poppin' out, you look the weirdest

Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowing, pass the blunt to my mama
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'

Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no it's not the westside
Stick it up your southside (icky icky icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude

Smoking weed and drinking, all the college students loving Q

Cameras in the street, birds in the sky watching
Trees in the blunts, stunt when I run, Groovy

Everything good, everything good gravy

[Hook: ScHoolboy - SZA in background]
Got a sack of marijuana, think I'm 'bout to bend a corner
Ain't no telling who my money for

Super sweet, sell a trick a treat
Hope your lips in shape, cuz you worked yo feet
As you stroll them streets
Beeper checkin', hope no cops arrestin'
Girl, I told you them NARCS be pressin'
Better act you a pedestrian and don't mention my name
My pimpin' is game
Cold limp with my cane, got gold on my chain
Come pinky my ring, it's so blickety bling
On 51st and Fig, grew up about 10 minutes from the real Ricky
Where the shoelaces is orange with "H" hats like we from Houston
Condoms in hoes' purses
With baby wipes for they coochie
You's a ho that's selling booty
No need to be acting bougie
Bitch, I give your ass a noogie
And a chicken nugget and make you watch me at the movies
I'm panoramic, my filming be rated pimping
My mink draggin' with two bitches that go and get it, my hoes get it!

[Verse 2: Suga Free]
Uh huh, yeah watch me go Black Forest ham

And don't let yo Shark Week mouth override yo Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'ma crown too
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my motherfuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yea P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard hed that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday!
Now get em Q
A pimp on foot, go to sleep, call us, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and.. he was pretty stupid
So you know what?
Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world P cuz
That ho only yours as long as she hoin'
But Happy Pimpin' and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cuz that bitch'll run a ho or two off mayn
Pimps only fuck with pimps homie that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due
It's easier to put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't askin', I'm tellin' you

[Hook:]


[Hook:]
Get up out your seat

Ghetto chick, but I love them bamboos
No lean, but I chopped and screwed
She ain't the groupie type but I had to
Champagne pop, I'm about that life
Molly gon' pop, I'm about that life
Backwood toke, I'm about that life
Living good, might not remember this night
World might end, so I'm living my life
Fuck hanging out, I ain't tryna fly kites
Tryna go to Paris? Nigga hit me on the Skype
Tryna do a show? Nigga twenty for the hype
Uh, don't touch me, bitch, I'm famous
Tryna ball, then bang your fingers...
Living large, I'm an entertainer
So cold but I come with flamers
First sex, she up in my closet
Whips drawers while I top the paws...
Girl let me see you stop and pause it
Fuck around, might pay your mortage

[Intro:]
I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun
Fuck punching in, throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli hit the right spot
Bang... Last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy back
When the only fan I had was a fiend
Meet me by the Acura cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy never once been a hoes hero
He get zero, I said nada
Bitch pass the cama (Uh, yeah)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
I'm a product of a real nigga
La-la-la familia, real nigga
Get confronted by a real nigga
Fuck with one of my real niggas
It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball
How'd it feel to be a real nigga
My whole life I've been a real nigga
La-la familia, real nigga
Get confronted by a real nigga
Fuck with one of my, real niggas
It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?

[Beat Change]

[Hook:]
I done jumped off my ass, hit the lick and barely pass
But I quickly got to to ballin
2012 ain't really happen, so I guess it's back to trapping
Eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal, my uncle stole my stereo
My grandma can't control him
But... uh, uh
Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... uh, uh
Click-clack, pow-pow-pow, boom, nigga
But... uh, uh
Meet Glock clock familia

[Verse 1:]
Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt
Gangsta lean help, hoodie on backwards with the eyes cut out
My hate felt, my.45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, Schoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow, higher than Margiela's
Since a young nigga I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday he still get a hit
Whether jacking radio's or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Now let's re-rewind it, answer my church
Times getting harder than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time all you niggas was on purp
My sober ass was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck freeze
Give me the keys, extra Frito's, chili and cheese
Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes before I leave
The cops'll never get the leak, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun was the accessory, 211 sipping plus a robbery
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things that we couldn't afford
The new J's and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why my uncle done sold his Benz
Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors when he around
But anyways, he wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, grandma light a hotter chick every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me Whisky to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to hurry up, he in a rush
I gave it to him then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like "nigga, know who you dealing with"
Them was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone my niggas' brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back, he called us over like "Hey"
YAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like "Damn, nigga"
Then again, YAWK, YAWK! We like "Damn, nigga"
Hearing him say cause turned us to a fan, nigga
Later on he got locked so know we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
This little Piggy went to market, this little Piggy carry chrome

[Hook]


[Hook]
I'm a groovy type nigga, rather two-step with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, rather gangbang with you
Triggers squeeze, throw a palette, throw them thing-things with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Hot degrees, anti-freeze, chilling cool-cool with you
Chilling cool-cool with you
Pants sagging, rag dragging, do my gangbang with you

[Verse 1]
Groovy nigga, jumped off of the peg
Forced by my third leg
Plead the fifth, no L's, no whips, backyard full of Crips
Barbecues and county blues, this Hoover gangster be the shit
It ain't much up on our list, shoot the killer and hit the licks
Get NUT up out the bitch, gangbanging, fuck a clique
Yup, I'm looking for a scrap
See, my cripping done spread around the world
Well, his top be low, his bottom is the reefer

[Bridge]
Looking like the reaper in your driveway
Strays through your living room
Liable to drive-by on a summer day
July 4th will be in June
Block ten block ten block ten bla ba bum
The sound of the drum, the sound that crips and bloods know
Block ten block ten block ten bla ba bum
The sound that the drums seen

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't make me put a lean to a nigga spleen
Shells through a nigga (bariiing-riing-riiing)
Stop a dream in its tracks beam down
Little boy now, dream little boy, dream
Coke go in the pot, arm and hammer body
A$AP.Rocky, want it I could get it
Onion in my pocket like the booty on a midget
Diamond on my rollie teach a nigga how to fridge it
Looking at the time, been winning for a minute
See my neck co-defendant, what's the problem?
Seen the souls long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Tell me more about it in the gutter
Where it started with the cripping
Blue on campus know it happened
Tell me more about it in the gutter
Where it started with the cripping
Then the bloods done got it brackin' (Suwoo!)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I'm just an Eastside nigga
Where them niggas say "Show you what it be like, nigga"
Roll 'em up, light 'em up like a street light, nigga
Follow me, I can show you what these streets like, nigga
Handle bars, ever swing, guns blow like dusty winds
Spend a band, push his wig back when that revolver spins
Toe tag 'em, false flagging like it's all good
Tell niggas tee off like Tiger Woods, where you from?
We never heard of ya, walking with the murderers
Niggas that'll murder ya, steal you like a burglar
Seen the souls long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper

[His & Her Friend Interlude]

You ain't said nothing but a word, smoke something for ya nerve
Home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third, bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow, every once in a while

[Prescription:]

[Verse 1:]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now the pressure creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a bust out in the 80's but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs

[Interlude: Joy]
What's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up!

[Verse 2:]
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6: 45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some wood for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Wise night, but that's my life
Prescription drugs

[Joy:]
What's wrong you tired? You mad? OK I love you daddy

[Oxymoron:]

[Hook:]
I just stopped selling crack today
I just stopped selling crack today
O-X-Y, a moron
O-X-Y, a moron

[Verse 1:]
Crazy, got my sex on wet in her Mercedes
Ladies, get these off new shoes for my baby
Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi
What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta reel 50 times just to get a rack off
Ungh, I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only read it one time, with his son, belly shine
In the rain for about nine months out the year '97 right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers
When I look up at y'all city
Like lookin' in the mirror, damn near had a career
Just might shed a tear
Ungh, yo, man this shit right here
For my niggas who ain't make it home, sitting on a tear
Got a dap to a nigga bright in here
Feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like {clear}
Ungh, big body cold like a Polar Bear
Ungh, I done sold more shit than hookers
Expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Vanity slave, got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same
Even if I got life, I ain't saying a name

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Oh wee, cops bringing dogs so they don't sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50, you can get one for 30 if you let me hook this titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr.J
I prescribe you I'm your doctor kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroine
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit so I don't listen
In fact "we livin' to die" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

[Hook]


I'm your Pusha Man
Time and time I heal again
Always down to lend a hand
Would you tell a friend?
I'm the one that keep the work
Just direct them to the fancy shirt
How you doing love? Ain't no limit pass the sky above
By far your cheapest trip, just a dub
Welcome to the game, promise you won't feel the same
4-1-1 they know my name
I'm your Pusha Man (eh)
Girl, I'm your Pusha Man
Girl, I'm your Pusha Man
Time and time I heal again
How you doing tell a friend?
I'm your Pusha Man
All the things that you adore
How you feeling tell me more?
I'm your Pusha Man

So, I'm just sitting in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment
Shit, my type ain't quite her type
But now this gangsta nigga on it
She can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat
Put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl
I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl
You ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
'Cause you girl, 'cause you girl, girl, 'cause you girl, girl

So, I'mma put this dick up all inside of you

[Intro: Joy, Q's daughter]
My daddy said "Yeah nigga"

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
(Bow, bow!) Coming in for yours
Niggas got them choppers and they knocking at your door
The sirens getting louder when the bodies hit the floor
Why you look confused? Motherfucker, this is war

[Interlude: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
As this G shit begin, put this product placement on your chin
The realest nigga breathing, y'all pretend
Real creepy since I hopped off the swing
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yeah, uh, yeah)
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome
Now nah, I ain't on no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm creeping
Niggas rap about what I'm living, all this false claiming, I'm marring
Doing drive-by's I ain't steering, white funerals, I ain't tearin'
Fuck your bitch in front of your children
Steal your whip side of my building, yeah
Put my dick and nuts in her mouth, bust in her hair
I'm very rare, got my trigger on top of my underwear
Bitch, I'm everywhere and over there
You die here, let of a pair (YAWK, YAWK)

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
House full of kilo's, sold pound to zero's
Cocaine my hero, you in Figg Side, getting Deboed
Always asking for the burner light, young niggas still free load
Heart big as my ego, don't fly around my signal
I'll rearrange your dental, crappy my house shoes
Blue rag disciples, murder I'm liable, you get the Eiffel
Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the strike once
Won't get the strike twice, you niggas half price
Which means you half off, I'm going Adolf
I'm smoking bath salt, two sherm sticks, burn this, ooh
Knock-knock through the condo's, Schoolboy from the five dues
But Hoover respect to you unreg, don't fuck around, get that chin banged
Groove lining, Crip walk the whole mile
Belts, still my pants down, Chuck Taylors, Cortez's, hush puppies
My Glock, yeah, fuck buddy, make money, take money
Earn crack money, drug money, bail money
Heard they got life for me, but how they got life for me
When they took that from me, since I had my nose runny
I was out past sunny, had the strap by my tummy
You can go and ask mommy, grab a body bag, homie, yeah

[Hook]

[Interlude]

[Bridge: Schoolboy Q]
Bust my gun all by myself
Rock cocaine all by myself
Pour propane all on myself
Go so hard might harm myself

Yeah, nigga, uh, yeah, nigga
Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
Yeah, it's Kurupt young motherfucking Gotti
Still rolling in a 6, I don't fuck with the Bugatti
Come up in this motherfucker looking for a bitch
Probably sucked on my dick and then you kissed her on the lips
The [?], South Central setting them
Get roped and choked, poetical tentacles stretch
Get roped and choked and rope-a-doped
Extra overdose of the Oki-doke
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about
They walked 'em in, I walked 'em out
They talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out
Now cock back that Oxy (Pow-pow, pow-pow)
Walk inside, pussy popping, top is popping off
Papadopulos neighborhood, roll with 60 bars
Ghettotropolis, squeezing pussies like octopuses nigga
Show me where the money at, show me where the kush is
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes
This is the reasons why I won't be fucking with pussies like you
Me, Tyler and Schoolboy Q, we told them

[Hook]


[Intro]
This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees, yeah, I got the codeine

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mill and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me, but they should of shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coke
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy want a piggyback
Rock cremation then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating till my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
Till Tito kilos come off that boat

[Hook: Schoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need, tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees, girl I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly, this the shit why I'm high
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want (Tell 'em, tell 'em)

[Bridge: Schoolboy Q]
If you see my watch I might hit it
If you see my check I might hit it
If you see my house I might hit it
This the shit that they want, this the shit that they need
This the shit that's from me
This the shit they gon' want, this the shit that they want
This the shit that they want

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
She want Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice, graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bank roll, nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po' lights
When I was poor with no lights, when I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches, oh lord she in Christians
All gold on my Adventist, pull it down and she kiss it
All gold where my wrists is, God there's just no convincing
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word round town I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say "que pasa with the pesos?"
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (TRU!)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
100k in my trunk, keep that bitch with that dunk
She gon' pop in them heels, she must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills, just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq, this that make you climax
This that shit you just bought, this that Q go damn hard
This that car that won't park, pedal to the floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop, Oxymoron in stores
Come in kids, lock the door, knock knock knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top, could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill, get them slugs off for real
This that crow with the jail, we go in, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell, leave that punani killed
All them hoes want the Q, spit that truth, make the loot
Expensive whips we hotbox, spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock, this that make me pop shot
This that filthy convo, this that must be Figg Road

[Hook]

[Bridge]


[Hook]
Had pistols in my hands, had pockets full of Ox
Whole life I been a G, had bitches on the block
Had strippers on the pole, had cocaine in the pot
Got fiends at the do' so I turned that to a rock
That yay yay
That yay yay

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
I'm a drug dealin' nigga, cause them grades ain't get me paid
My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid
See my daughter need some shoes and my mom work overtime
So I'm standin' by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that hero'n, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty something, so three hours late aiight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street

[Bridge]
Figg get it, get it yeah
Drug dealin' nigga
Yawk yawk yawk

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
I'm a drug dealin' nigga, roll my cyc' on Hoover's street
Just a year after Pac died we all bump Suga Free
Didn't know what he was sayin' til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slangin' hoes and every car door need a key
Charge them smokers day through night, sellin' pies who need a slice
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack itâs Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like itâs the bay, rock a chain Iâm Kunta K
Out in Texas whatâs the word, keep them packs and thatâs for sure
Slang to him and slang to her, ask a fiend they will concur

[Bridge]


[Hook:]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater

About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
A 92 but 91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And If I crash in the woods then I'ma follow with this
Like I'm tryna get stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is a M
Might get that X6 end don't follow exit him
Might take back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on your neck thats his precious gems
Now AMG it's in boy I will eat him Benz
New engine you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratchin rims again

[Hook:]
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater

Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, cause you drive me wild

Girl I get a rush
When we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much
And you can feel the wind in my heart
Girl I get a rush
When we're speeding in my car
Sometimes it's too much

I know some dudes that would find you
That carry rugers and shottas
And fucking shoot at your Honda
Then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonalds
Boy I'm a king and I ain't lying boy hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm
Cashing so many checks there calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo Okonma but oh nada
Probably September...
Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mask of the timberwolves
State park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
Cause I kill the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in(beep)
Give it till he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it

Back when left brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk (Skate!)

[Girl:] Can you roll my window up?
[Tyler:] The fuck you turn my music down for man?
[Girl:] Can you roll my window up?
[Tyler:] Why? Damn!
[Girl:] Cause it's windy
[Tyler:] But I love it when your hair...

Blows, when it blows, when it blows
When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows, when it blows
Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows
When it blows, when it blows, when your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches

You can say you don't want to take that drive
But your hair, it blows
I know we'll have a good time
You just gotta stop being scared
Just roll
Just come and roll with me
It's all good

[Erroll:] Yeah, man,what's good man, you good? I've been chilling, man. I've been doing some push-ups and shit

[Lionel:] Yeah, she is
[Erroll:] God dammit! I'd still fuck!


I don't want you thinking I love you cause I stay
Girl I really like you and happy we got laid
I think about your windows like two times in a day
I'm a pervert with a purpose, like priest who just got saved
Kissing, kissing, I'm on a mission of licking
The holy grail of your body, when you be kissin', Mrs
This is a kid from Africa, you, you are a kitchen
I come quicker than pitches from Sammy Sosa
You hoping I'm joking, but first

[Hook x2:]
I'ma eat your pussy til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it
Grab my camera
Nine months later with a Tyler baby
But that won't happen til I blow my load

Your pussy tighter than door hinges
I munch you like sandwiches
But not any more cause I'm on tour, so
Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hard, shit
I might need an ice pack on my wrist
Fucking, I'm pumping
You know it's coming, bust in a couple of seconds
I'm sweating, I leave you slump
In the back of my truck, butt naked
Suck it out of me
I leave you with nothing, get it?
This is what you wanted, this is what you came for

[Hook]

You blow me away
With your cherry
(Can't breathe)

That was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film
Be caller eight to win tickets to the triple feature Moon Theatres tonight
Three back to back to back movies at the Moon Theatres tonight
Be the eighth caller, only on Golf Radio
G-O-L-F, G-O-L-F, it's Golf Radio


(Yeah... You feel alright?)

God, goodness gracious
I can't wait to see the look on y'all niggas faces
That boy T not surprised his thoughts and chasten
Fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word faggot with book
And all them books is pissed off and at they page in a bunch
Fuckin' attitude switch is like a book with a strife
But, I'm a fraud I pray to God when it's six triple book bashin' while
Me and my favorite archive lips tickle
Peter Parker pickle pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fuckin' kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kiddin' keep the Tommy on me bitch, I'm Ms.Pickles
Said I seem off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'preme off
Should've bought some stock in it (Yo it's fucked up, I get it. 
It's shocking as fuck! They ain't get it)
Not Golf when the little homies don't, wait
Lets weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, That bought some attention
Give none to Hopsin
And dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad, it's the slave in me
It's Facts boy i'm back like Rosa Parks in their favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T'
While y'all niggas watchin' the throne, the throne be watching me

If you fuck this up
There are so many fuckin' kids right now, listenin' to this guy
Get those wings flapping motherfucker!
Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly

Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigger nigger on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, guys shootin' basketballs
Tyler the DARKskin, arrested in AUStin
Cops know who I was cause kids said the show was AWEsome

Tyler, Tyler, I swear to, I swear to fuck! If you fucking...
Do NOT fuck this up!
You have the whole world in your fucking hands

How many leaders in the house?
Well can't somebody bring the mirrors out, I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies, the snaps make it obvious
That everybody on this fucking planet lackin' confidence
How many leaders in the house? (Do not fuck this up!)
Well can't somebody bring the camera out so I can film me
See a great director nigga's vision must be blurry
Boy I give them epic shots like jaywalkin' in Missouri
Wait...
How many leaders in the house?
Well can't somebody bring my album out so I can hear one
Pour me a drink, shit I don't know what to think
Cause all these niggas leaning like they Forest Whitaker's blink
Wait...
How many leaders in the house?
See why nobody got they hands up, see that's the issue


I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know how to perform it

Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out his flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a god, no, I don't pray to society
All you other niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
What weak niggas see me?
Nigga, Young creators will scream with me
Nigga, you ain't got drivers to just beep-beep .
They wanna talk shit from the back seat
Come and light,my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Float in the air
It's cherry bomb

You muthafuckas want war, then come get it
You muthafuckas want war, I don't want war
(Muthafuckas!)Just take me to the gun store
I don't got enough time for your rolex nigga
I choke your dad, hit your mom, cuz I don't know that nigga
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga, I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off, let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Strangled in the air
It's cherry bomb

You muthafuckas want war?!
Fuck that like "this that cherry bomb"
They're like "this that cherry bomb"

I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control

GOLF 191, Okaga
Play classic hits


Um, excuse me mister but can you please turn down the lights
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga

I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego here so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school
And you will never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named the album Cherry Bomber cause Greatest Hits sounded boring

I don't like to follow the rules, she said that I must
I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk who's in charge of this Golf shit
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant"
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, yellin' out "unpark it"
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick
It's young T

I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand

And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand

Better pose for that camera
Better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action

Now you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life

Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp

Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips half on my tongue
Moonwalk through your hair
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
(Lights, and the camera, and the action)
You should be mine in a way tonight
(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)


Find your wings (s'possed to fly)
Find your wings (find your wings)
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta
Find your wings (fly)
Find your wings (find your wings)

My lil nigga, the world is yours, birdy

We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low
You're a bird
You're supposed to fly away
The way you stand there
Don't let your wings go to waste (go to waste)
The sky is your home, be free
Be free


[FUCKING YOUNG]

The day that I met you girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck I can't sing whatever look)
We met through mutual friends
And this is where the story and confusion begin
Cause I was in a problem but I had to pretend that I wasn't

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

A six year difference
Is a ten year sentence
And with the pigment on my skin, I don't want to be another statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

There go the police man knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat
Or do I answer real confused like "I don't know"
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man I'm so paranoid

Girl you're perfect, but you're too fucking young for me
And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
This is more than a crush, I just might be in love

When you're 35, I'll be 41
And when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo this is dumb
You should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention
Span, it's gonna suck your shit
Hits that kitchen fan
It splattered on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck
(But you're too fucking young)
I really like you
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this, I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie
(But you're too young, but you're too young, but you're too young)

[PERFECT]

[Kali Uchis:]
Boy I know that we could be more than just friends
But you're scared
Boy I know
That we could be more than just friends
But you're scared
I know
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I exit and wait a while
(Just say the word)
See the answers are all there
(But I'm just too blind to see)
You and I are cut from different fabric
(I wonder why, I wonder why girl)
Don't be too material to see
(But I'm just too blind to see)
This world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby it's just you and me

[Tyler:]
But you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts
It fuckin hurts
Fuck
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts
It fuckin' hurts
Cause you're too fuckin' young
And girl I know that you're the one
That you're the one
For me
Cause you're too fuckin young
And girl I know that you're the one for me
Yeah
(I rock)
(I rock)
(I rock)


[Hook:]
Got the whips, got the hoes
Got the ice, got the clothes
Niggas know that keys open doors
Half price nigga keep the o's
Keep the o's, nigga keep the o's
Know they call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
Keep the o's, (nigga) keep the o's
Know they know me by treat your nose

[Verse 1 - Pharrell Williams:]
Look, UFO, bow, land
Skrr landed on the ass and
Adidas leaf in the grassland
My finger got a yellow Pac-Man
Blow your purple
Go in circles
(So inertia)
Go reverse it
No rehearsin'
Gold is perfect
Open curtain, flow inversion
Golden person
Yeah I'm nerdy, yeah I'm swerving
Yeah you heard me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2 - Tyler, The Creator:]
My garden's full from breaking these hoes
A hand full of green and a couple of stones
Your lawnmower's foreign, you rent you a home
But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise, I know my accomplishments
Fuck your compliments, bitch I got confidence
I don't need your approval, my nigga you suck
I do not have to adjust
You stuck, I'm talking
So shut the fuck up
Speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You convene with that circle of demons youâre hoping them niggasâll see it
Results may vary
Chains got too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than crash in that Bugatti
Back to the garden
Niggas gon' do dirty
Y'all already saw it
Killing your flowers
This thingâs impossible
It's the new slave apocalypse
Isnât that obvious
All you stupid niggas got the whips

[Hook]

Keep da o's
You gotta keep the o's
Cause you never know when it's over
You want the doors that go up
You want the girls with the big butts
You want the diamonds, you want the stones
You gotta stunt on these niggas
Stunt on these niggas one time

Find your wings
Find your wings
Find your wings
And fly
You'll find your wings
(You'll find your wings)
Learn how to fly
(Learn how to fly)

What I want you to do
(What I want you to do)

You'll find your wings
Learn how to fly
(Learn)

I'm rapping about diamonds, and cars, and money now
What the fuck has gotten into me, man


[Verse 1 - Tyler, The Creator:]
Let's just run away from here (cause it's not, cause it's not)
Working out on Earth, my dear (cause It's not, cause it's not)
What you really want girl (ooh)
My heart stops pumping blood, when I see you (I see you, when I see you)
But try to play it cool because (I like you, I really like you)

[Hook - Tyler, The Creator:]
Girl, you're so special
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me

[Verse 2 - Tyler, The Creator:]
Let's move to California
Right now (pack your bags, go pack your bags)
I have wings on my back, so we don't (take the plane, have to take the plane)
Girl, I know you ready, I can see it in your eyes
(Boy, I know you're not, I can tell you're terrified)
Oh, nobody has to know and if they did, they wouldn't care
(When you rub my hands switching fifth gear)
Forget about it baby, let's not waste our afternoon (forget about it baby)
Cause we're gonna go fly to the moon (we're gonna go fly to the moon)
Yeah, but anyway (Pack your bags, need you pack your bags)
Leave your crew, bring your coat, cause it's cold (leave your crew, bring your coat)

[Hook - Tyler, The Creator:]
Girl, you're so special
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me
To me, to me (ohh)

[Verse 3 - Alice Smith (Leon Ware):]
(Don't you wanna go back)
(Let's go, let's go)
(Right now)
I think I believe you (Let me show you how girl)
It's nice that I need to
The earth is so rough I'm not calling your bluff
What, what, what (She would love that)
I think I believe you
Take me higher
Let's make our way over
To the Okaga cave
Today (today)
There we will stay, play it cool now
X-Y-Z her
Welcome me in
Then we'll begin

[Verse 4 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Suckin' on my ears, fingers rubbing through your hair
Fastwind, slowwind, fuck yeah, we behaving bad, uh
Probably couldn't tell but I be blushing when you with me
When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy, oh
Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Laying on my arm, it's dead
From the pressure of your head
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, but you meant it
Like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sippin on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now
Cause we're fleeing to the moon
Fuck Earth, man we sick of y'all
Wings on my backs and we ain't gotta cop a ticket, nah, nah, nah

[Coda - Leon Ware:]
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah (Let's go!)
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah, let's go to the moon!
(Watch this) Let's go to the moon!
Oh yeah
(Favorite director)
(Gonna be good)
Come on, baby
What you wanna do?
(I'll be okay)
(I really like you)

[Alice Smith (Leon Ware):]
Take me away
Fuck what they say
To another place
Another day
We in outer space
We'll waste our days
Sade, Sade, Sade
Oh, right now
Yes!
Let's go to the moon (Yes!)
(It's about to start)


Fly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when?
On a scale from nine to ten
You taking L's baby, 
Hold my hand and feel the wind, uh
Now fasten your seatbelt and turn everything off
I got your attention, muthafucka I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
Brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga you ain't high enough to save me
Don't talk to me til I fuckin' embarrass you
Now sit your ass down you do it three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up

I'm so far ahead you niggas I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you
You niggas know what I'm sayin'
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fuckin' pilot, your role is to be the stewardess
I'm the fuckin' bomb like I would stuff my shoe in it
If anything happens it's one door
If I see a building, motherfucker we're done for
I'mma hit a couple of 'em up cause it's Parkour
Then I call your family and get your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless

I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash, I don't wanna crash anymore
I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til there's nothing left in the gas tank
I don't wanna crash

I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach

I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be
With no alphabet dictatin' where to stand at
You could buy a car, you could buy many things
You could buy happiness but you can't buy wings
You could buy a parachute, you could buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings that will dynamic
Stay cloud level

That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach

I don't wanna


[Chaz Bundick:]
Fuck you running for nigga?
Aye nigga, come here nigga
Let me try that hat on
I told you come over here stupid bitch
Come over here with that weak ass hat

All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out
In the car called life, took the lame route
Going nowhere fast but you think that you not
Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop
At his drop top, took another lame out
Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?
Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga
Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
And make sure that your mama cry the pain out
Now the gang is out
To get you but you stuck in the same house
Nigga never came out, wow, it's a shame how
You got sucked in that life, but hey man at least you got a name now
They say you a real nigga cause you kill niggas
Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out
For they approval boy, you can't even hang out
That light you hit
It was the light I held
That's why you never ever see me with my chains out
I don't need to
Truth they don't feed you
Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you
They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you
Better look the other way if he ever see you
And run as fast as you can
Nigga

[Chaz Bundick:]
That's the shit I be talkin' bout, though
We ain't try'na hear that shit, my nigga
Cuz, stay preachy cuz

Yeah, we all black, who give a fuck, cuz?
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Whatchu mean?


[Tyler, The Creator:]
For your boy
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks
With the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna' cop the new McLaren
With the vertical doors, nigga

Money, money, money, money
Money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not impo'tant
I'm focused (2, 3, 4)
Bring in the horns
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkin's a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suck him at your neck like a hickey, boy, I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' wit me
I got banned from New Zealand, Whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, goddammit, I couldn't believe in it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigga
I clearly don't give a fuck so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack and fuck your Snapchat
Cherry Bomb
The greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop
Just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raisin' the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

[Kanye West:]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan
Scottie Pippen at my weddin'
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin a bite or somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?"
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they tell they white daughters
"Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon
You can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck, hold up
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
Had a drink with Fear, and I was textin' God
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"

[Tyler, The Creator:]
For your boy
I'm tryna' cop the new McLaren
With the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks
Got a trampoline in my room, damn

(2, 3, 4)
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted
I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin losers

[Lil Wayne:]
Hold your fuckin' ponies my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely
I eat pussy like Shoney's (Yeah)
It's Tunechi, homie, master of ceremonies
I knock 'em down, domino effect, no pepperoni
I swear

[Tyler the Creator (Lil Wayne):]
This them Golf boys, like them Hot Boy$
For the nine-nine and two-thousand
But its the two-thou'
And the one-four

Yo, what up Wayne?

'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
Cuz nigga I'm a god, a divine one
Tune

[Lil Wayne:]
My trigger finger wise
But my 9 dumb (yeah)
Middle finger blind
So it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son
A hundred ways to die son
I'm starin' at a tramp-on-lean
Make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks
Wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rolie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness

[Tyler, the Creator:]
Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy' buddy
Ye, we hittin' models
Like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel
(Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy, lets get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas
I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin
Cause I'm tryna' hang like I'm Mr. Cooper
Or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon, was
Fuck us
Maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys
Cuz I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, uhh..

[Lil Wayne:]
Son you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef
Like zucchini
I know; it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Nah faggot, it's Golf Wang
(2, 3, 4)


Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
Anything that'll piss you muthafuckas off
I don't even smoke and I'm a level up of all of y'all
Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card

I'm special, nigga
Who the fuck are you?!
I'm special, nigga

They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm runnin' shit, that's why you never see me wearin' joggers
Lead by example, how?
All y'all is my son and I ain't never had a fuckin' father
Boy, I'mma bring the noise
I got my own beat and we all got drums
What these weapons about? We're just flexin' about
You on your grind who the one that got the wep at their house?
Bitch, I do this on purpose, you niggas don't got a purpose
This nigga call me a clown, nigga I own the circus
Stack is sittin' in my pocket folded up like a papaya
You know I golf bitch like I been sleepin' with Tiger
Woody woody, my mob, mob is goodie we Oddkast
We o-K-K-K just like the clan
Hoodie golf shit packet, rip it out the fuckin' package
In that all pink fit lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even know
I'm about to tear the shit out this goddamn house
I think I'm about to blow my muthafuckin' brains out
Tyler, take a chill pill, nigga


[Part 6 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Oh, you the motherfucking man, huh?
Oh, you be fucking bitches, counting all the bands, huh?
Oh, you be trapping out the bando selling grams, huh?
Oh, you be smoking, drinking lean, and popping Xans, huh?
You see, that's the bullshit that I don't need
I'm telling y'all niggas, y'all ain't fucking with me
See, I look in the mirror and he said, "You are the man"
And I said, "Hey man, I agree"

[Part 7 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow
Boy, I hit the block, like I hate Legos
They know they got thirty seconds, Jared Leto
Before they see some halos, and I reload the ammo
Boy is Golf Wang-o, and that's the squad I bang-o
Until my fucking brain go, now let's reload the aim-o

[Part 8 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Can't a nigga get some fucking chaos in hurr?
I'm the truth and the dare
And you can get your ass beat like a kick and a snare
ScHoolboy's my niggy, you know I'm good in the 50s
That boy's not that bad, enh, it's no biggy
It's the G-O, the L-F, we go-go, no homo
We black out, and go hard like JoJo and fuckin' Diggy
No ship in this series, since I pissed off Iggy man
We been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Catch me in some vans like one of them soccer mamas
And them bitches blue like that family went to the Dodgers
Solve em (Oh no!) you can't bitch, I'm a problem
You get fucked up like the thoughts inside of my noggin
Going harder than the quidditch in Harry Potter
All my shows got one black in it like Larry David
And I'm that nigga, meaning I'm two niggas, I'm schizo
Brent Lowe, my motherfucking bingo
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow

[Part 9 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Don't get offended, love being darkskinned
23 with the crib and I don't got no tenants
And I don't like sports, but the court got a tennis
Is that diamonds on your neck? Stay the fuck out my business
See, that's the cherry bomb, get my burr on
That's McLaren, '91 out the Chevron
Motors Flog Gnaw, Vans on, fuck your Jordans
Went from throwing up to throwing carnivals (Yeah, nigga!)

[Part 10 - Tyler, the Creator:]
Boy, I'm a sicko, flaco nigga, but kinda macho
Boy, I got some vatos and shout out to ScHooly, he kinda loco
Pack a de la pistol, we splitting nachos, then for that cheese
Boy, he was using some shells just like a taco, so grab your goggles
Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
(Man, he really took the store)

[Part 11 - ScHoolboy Q:]
Crack a cracker with a barrel uh (Yeah)
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag (Rag)
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy (Uh, sup cop)
Pants heavy, sag to the left
With the belt strapped, no face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried bout no niggas (Nigga)
Grieve over suckers (Sucker), gunpowder on my knuckles (Knuckle)
Call the ambulance (Ambulance), I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?

[Part 12 - ScHoolboy Q:]
Cuz is wack when he raps, and what he rap, he ain't done
Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussy boy you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel
You want to smoke that kil'
Well who am I?


Now when I first saw you
I could tell you was the one
That I've been searchin' for
I needed somethin' that was like the Sun
Now all my flowers grow
Right now my life, it blooms, baby

You're my favorite color, my favorite color
My favorite color's you
It's like the endless summer, endless summer
Whenever I'm with you
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow


[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, I come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscious
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that
But that's where the money came from

[Hook x2: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 phoners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shits getting harder
The only thing you wanna bump her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep, and the seashore ain't soil
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess youâre accustomed to what youâre used to
So you bought two, nigga
They are coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and itâs all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shootin' up, itâs my fault,
You can blame me motherfucker, for killin' your aunties and uncles,
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger,
And a little chain tuck, didnât realize this game fucked, up some lives
âOh howâs ma?â my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that Iâm fine I got a little money in my pocket.

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I sold that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, Iâm sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, Iâm sorry
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, Iâm sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I canât see the shore, I'm sorry

[Outro: Nas]
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever
And next thing you know youâre in too deep, way too deep
Scare the shit out of you, you wind up with so much work
That you'll be scared to death
It's important for us to realize, man
We gotta get out of that, man
Ya know, dudes is buying choppers
To shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins
Ya known what I mean?


[Hook 1: Tyler]
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer [x4]
Because when I call
I hope you pick up your phone
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
Dad isn't your name, see Faggot's a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he, gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But, sucks you ain't give a fuck and consider a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I ain't just being passive, nigga.
You're a fucking faggot, nigga.
Got a show on Monday, guess who ain't getting no passes, nigga?
But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga
And call him...

[Hook: Tyler (Syd)]
I hope you answer [x4]
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up)
I'd like to talk to you
I hope you answer

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck,
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone until November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I'd like to tell my grandma, but she's just nostalgia
I'll call her number
But she won't answer

[Hook: Tyler (Syd)]
I hope you answer [x4]
Because when I call (When I call, baby)
I hope you pick up your phone
(I'd like to talk to you)
I hope you answer

[Verse 3: Tyler]
You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on an island in Thailand and I was wildin'
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a churches
But, I'mma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer.

[Outro: Tyler]
That last verse was about this girl. Haha.


[Verse 1]
I was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker yeah I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greeting
And your eyes the same color shit that jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first offical date so I was stuck like
It was past curfew, and we was at the grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grabbed my hand, talking about trying to get home safe
All I remember, was your motherfucking face, your face

[Hook]
I play in your hair
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like Iâm floating in air
Can't you believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a ziplock bag

[Verse 2]
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever Iâm holding your hand
And making eye can-tact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
Iâm insecure then I start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I could own em or lease it or clone it
Because holding your fingertips is golden.
I fucking love you, I treat my problems like a bowling ball &
I grip and keep holding on
Girl?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You got a nigga sprung
Wait, don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I havenât talked to you in a couple of days,
I got too comfortable and started to think we were really a couple
But hey at least it was time spent.
But by the time you will hear this you will know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize its awkward your names still my password
So Iâm always fuckin' reminded

[Outro: Tyler & Frank Ocean]
You're my Girlfriend.. you're my Girl (Whether you like it or not!)
You're my girl.. you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl Girlfriend
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my Girl (Shit I know that you're my)
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my Girl
You're my girlfriend


Went to Six Flags
Six fags came up and said "Ayo can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh it's Wolf Gang, Yonkers, Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, fuck, I don't want to be an asshole
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed because I missed Goliath
Cause some kid said I was there then they caused a riot
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarentee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo, I'm going fucking loco
"Hey Tyler can I..." No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard Radicals, the last part got to me.
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a pop condom
In school I was the one thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're in inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who like just cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking about the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song Bastard right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself fuck is he speaking to me
See me and you we go together like snare in a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see me forearm
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green miniramp that I built in my backyard (that's weird)
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy (uhhhh)
Tyler, I love you, I want to be just like you (alright)
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (no homo)
Wish I had a basement mitt for me to hide you
We could play X-Box and listen to 'In Search Of...' and eat donuts
Over conversating about what church does
Come up with weird ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead (uhhh, that's weird)
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't either
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (what the fuck)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbin
I know it seems like just I'm slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I'm lossing my fucking noggin (yeah you are)
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
Cause (thanks for the support) I love you man (alright)
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees, I like pants thats cut
I like words like fuck, I got your pics on my wall
With the mouth cut out, now paper cuts on my balls
Cause your dicks in my jaw (what the fuck)
And I hit on twitter about 10 minutes a day
And I'm bitter cause you don't even respond with a hey (sorry)
And my boys think I'm gay cause I play VCR
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
Alright my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on colossus, rhyme this slow as molasses
(Tyler listen) no nigga I see you are loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so its awkward, now I'm grouchy like oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige dockers
Yonkers and yonkers (I love that song)
Sick of hearing about yonkers
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and conquered
"Yeah whatever but I fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
And when I say sagan lockhart
And when you came out to Sandwiches
That's when my fucking boycrush got started"
Just take this fucking picture man, shit...


[Verse 1:]
Knock-knock, mothafuck it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

[Hook:]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 2:]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

[Skit]
Dr. TC: Hey
Wolf: Bitch
Dr. TC: I'm right here
Wolf: Yo, who's that?
Sam: That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?


Swag, 2011
Young Nigga

Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me half way, bitch I'm going all in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet
(No homo. Too soon.)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Wait a God damn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(Wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

Cut it out! I said I didn't want no goddamn lettuce.
I don't want that shit! I don't want your goddamn lettuce. He-he


[Tyler, The Creator:]
I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no goddamn meaning
Sorry -- I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight

[Pharrell (Tyler):]
C'mon baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love (I know)
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look. I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love
(Spend the rest of my life, looking for air)
(so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me)
(Fuck, look)
I'm in love (Love)

[Tyler, The Creator:]
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you
But I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah

[Tyler, The Creator as Wolf and Salem:]
Wolf: "Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
Salem: "He isn't such a badass actually.
He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home.
He's actually a dweeb"
Wolf: "Yo, what happened?"


[Verse 1 â Tyler, the Creator]
Papa ain't call even though he saw me on Tv, it's all good (fuck you)
But now my balls, balls deep in this broads jaws, swallow girl, it's just nutt'
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Floggnaw nigga you can tell by the badge
(pass me my inhaler)
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animals, Noah's arking, often just rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?"
Get shit popping like Peter's pores during puberty
And take bets on how quickly Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch

[Hook â Tyler, the Creator]
Shut em' down!
Nigga shut em' down!
Shut em' down!

[Verse 2 â Hodgy Beats]
I tumble crush on hudgy sluts, give money up then nutty, but
Professor Nutty Buddy Clumpkin's petty when you touch his lunch
Like "What the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck," turn the fucking music up
So I can hear these stupid fucks, talk no walk, like you discussed
You talking too much, "Who the fuck are you to us, uterus?"
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up, I'm shooting up
You and her, crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the ho in the bitch flocking 'round my crew to flirt
It's on your shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse, I'm ill I use this earth, to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to skip to my lou
Get hip to the pew, you can drink piss and eat a dick in a few
The sickening view, a visual woose, I eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids afterschool and give 'em drugs 'cause it's cool (fucker)

[Hook â Tyler, the Creator]
Shut em' down!
Nigga shut him down!
Shut em' down!

[Verse 3 â Tyler, the Creator]
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green, a little purple and pink
Get some swisher sweets, about three up, four more, then leave it be
I got a eigth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape I can taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You can smell us in places when we walk
And our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts and "What the fuck is this?"
I think this mary is laced, my heart is beating at paces
that Pacquiao can relate I'm fucking faded like gradient
Shit I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist.
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, this shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana is very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel pass the sherm
Let's use this Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit

[Domo Genesis]
C'mon my nigga you don't even smoke, you weak as fuck my nigga
You do not smoke, no tux my nigga, you're as weak as.. F- your butt my nigga...
Oh mark ass nigga, G- Oh my god bro,
Here comes that weak ass nigga Samuel.


[Dr. TC:]
So, what's going on Wolf? Talk to me man... 
People worry, we hear stories about you getting into fights 
and all this unnecessary bullshit. What's on your mind? Talk to me I'm here.

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Domo roll another one, I'm just fuckin' with you I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds
Momma got the Rover with the Range
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again
And I put that on my dead grandmother's name...too soon

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
My nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is reppin' like I been fuckin' with Kony
Nigga Phillip and Kobe, to my niggas that know me
Ya boy seem happy as fuck but truthfully ya boy lonely
Niggas a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target without bothering customers bothering
Asking me for a picture, then I talk to their sister
Naw nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God I wanna quit, but I can't, cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
4 stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And tourings' paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Lifes' a bitch bruh but from the third floor which is gorgeous
A year ago I was broke, now how can I afford this
I started off with disposables now I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now the frame is a pain in the ass to get it in
Without a scratch or stain on the glass
But that's not important, just as long as it's printed
And I hinted it is, and when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy bitch
Shit I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-ature
I'll even tell you the film I used in the aperture

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Grandmother died, didn't cry not a tear
I got a lot of fuckin wind no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup it left your boy stuck
Cause when my mom dipped out she was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom callin' and callin', I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she cryin' sayin' Sadie is dyin'
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck, nah this is really awkward for me bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Gettin' there, family sittin' center chair
Awkard in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there, there's a room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, hello
Our conversations brief, couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strife
I sat there 20 minutes tops, hopin' it was just a fuckin' plea that she could cop
She died that night

[Dr. TC:] Oh that's heavy man, I'm sorry for your loss

[Tyler:] Yeah whatever, don't worry about it..

[Dr. TC:] Last time I seen Sammy he was lookin' for you

[Tyler:] Fuck that nigga Sammy

[Dr. TC:] Uhh... Have you seen him?

[Tyler:] Nah but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed 'em


[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than tigger,
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger, (Uhh),
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block,
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em, (Uhh),
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill And let's pretend like,
I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers, (Uhm),
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck,
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor, (Uhh)
Pink haired Mrs, I'm her mister, sipping slurpees, bag of chips,
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture, (Uhh),
OF is popping like a blister, need some listerine,
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister, (Uhh),
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out of ten flasks,
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner, and hopefully I get her,
If I don't, Fuck it then, see I never simp son, pull the opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

[Hook: Casey Veggies & Tyler, the Creator]
Until the ozone leaves and the Earth is hot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
The moon not working and the stars align,
I stay golden, y'all thought I was out my mind,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot,
Loiter Squad lurking in the parking lot

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
(Somebody told me...)
I had a decline in the buzz, not a shocker bruh, I had the stun gun in my bum,
And when I drop shit you better have a towel and a sponge,
And ask why bitch, I eat a ton bucket of chum,
In Bikini Bottom, I am the biggest problem,
This shit fishy niggas dip like we were set in Harlem,
Eaters turn them into nuggets like Carmelo Anthon(y),
We just sit and burn shit just like my fucking anthem

[Verse 3: Mike G]
I'm like goals, those is something you have to stand to reach,
My campaign speech elect me, Commander in Chief,
Respect to me is ever minor, appearances cause mass hysteria,
But I'm still uncomparable, I'm like the face of America,
I'm the ambassador from a land made of gold,
I'm a fuckin' centerfold, I'm somethin' to behold,
I can kill a hundred shows, take on for the road,
I'm results of putting persistent pressure on coals

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tyler, the Creator]
It's a dog eat dog world, don't get bit bruh,
A son of a bitch I am, yup, I'm a sick pup,
(I thought that you were nice)
Yeah I am slut,
I'm also half ass a racist who hates niggas, Yep I'm a mixed mutt
Preme is the top bunk, green is the pillow case,
Golf is the bedsheets, (Hat and my T-shirt),
TrashWang sticker on that Chima Ferguson,
I'm real with the box, and I murder with the pen,
It's Bimmer Boy's boy never swerving in the Benz,
I'm listening to Dead Sam demos on the ten,
Can I get a medium with cheese and bacon?

It's Loiter Squad nigga...
Fucking Loiter Squad...

Sam's after you
Sam's after who?
You!
For what? What the fuck?
He found out that you and Salem are hanging out, he said he gonna kill you
Kill me? What the fuck you mean kill me?
Slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean he gonna kill me?
I don't know, he just said he gonna kill you
Not if I get to him first


[PartyIsntOver]

[Verse 1 x2: Tyler, The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We can still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we can still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fucking take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[Campfire]

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, uhm
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Mother fuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my flog gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer

[Verse 2: LÃ¦titia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, the tragical
Transformations, cease to be mindless
Create your sweetness
and the wave float onnnn

[Tyler, The Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, hehe
Who ate all the fuckin chocolate?
Oh that's Domo's fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't tryin to go home, really

[Bimmer]

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame impala
(And it's dark outside)
And I'm sharing slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
(Oooooooo)
You're fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don't know, I think you're chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm, It'll get dark outside soon (ride for it)
Where the streetlights sing (ride for it)
You don't have to lie girl to kick it its cool
We moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler, The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I'm trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro]
Where you been man?
I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey you've seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is.
Fuck that nigga man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake.
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some.
I got a can of these baked beans too.


[Verse 1:]
Geek, fag, stupid loser find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck.. Hated by everyone thats the way it seems
I don't know whats shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
Because none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression on the stalk again
My best friend is an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing Oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Because he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see
I know better then to show my face around them
But the day I do it will be everywhere
When I share these feelings Finally they gon' fucking care

[Hook]
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd future hooligans causing up a ruckus
Its Us. Nigga.
I said its us, nigga.

[Verse 2:]
Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... "uh" with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bully bitch who ain't gone trouble you
Well I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind umm
"Who are you again?" I'm Sammy and thats Tyler
And we came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking whats packin in these trench coats!
But just know if you start acting I'm grabbin for these trench coats!
My step-father called me a fag, I'll show him a fag
I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently them assholes that be fuckin' with me in class.
So I'mma keep them motherfuckers there and make sure they pass Huh.
My prom date, she distance my offer
So I'mma [?] and toss her in the principles office
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend? 
(Yeah but my parents) 
Oh don't worry you will probably never see them again

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Bum bum bo bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum
Bum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead its just four of us
We come in peace we mean no harm and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours

[Verse 3:]
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they missin'
I didn't mean to hurt anybody I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the army
I'm hardly ever angry, roger rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made see?
I don't wanna go to jail I just wanna go home
And I want those fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters make them dip
I'm fucking reloaded I told you all that I ain't takin' shit
You better backup before this mac starts to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them is being happy


[Intro]
I'm saying, you know, like
All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down
You know, like, you know, grow up!
Don't grow down, grow out
You go from being a kid, doing your thing, hanging out with friends
Months later you're world famous
You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it
You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler
Fuck you Tyler!

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
Watch me get this money nigga, tired of being hungry nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'mma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch
I'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad, its thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, [?] twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

[Hook x2: Domo Genesis]
Nigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
In a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylist, it's cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (Diddy Riese)
Na'kel Smith. Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
I'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens
See y'all niggas trippin' man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd. That shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an athiest that just worships Satan,
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Over and over, shit, who gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time. I'mma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering.
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)
I'm seeing it's a drop in my occular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff.
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot).
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you).
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!).
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
(Oh, shut the fuck up!).
[Gunshot]

[Outro: Sam]
Samuel's here!
Where's Wolf?
Fucking faggot.
Salem was mine, bitch!
Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?


[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb,
Bunny hop, zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D,
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs,
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums, niggas who pushing tons
Tons of drugs, Foul flow dirty mouth like kissing bums
Momma done made her one, a witty son
With no respect for women so-so, show me your titties hun
"You eighteen?", Me? I'm twenty something
Okay I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he cum?"
I'mma wax that like the chapstick in my backpack, for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, Mac and Cheese
New Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics, (How's your dick?), "Shit, How's your knees?"
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
Came up with "Rella", ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than, Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, "Aye!", getting TU, OF NB
We was missing Sweatshirt like, where's the hooded sleeve
Okay, nevermind, we found him

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyler, the Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in,
I stopped rapping and started asking "Where my fucking passion is?",
Probably where that faggot went (Who?), Tyler talking father problems,
Shocky shit he spit to popping topics in a gossip column,
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom,
Thought that roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom,
Now Ye's PJ sippin leche, Chips Ahoy! boy, listening to Cowboy,
Aye boy, land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy (Aye!),
AUS was AWES, I enjoyed, boy, y'all niggas played as a tot's toy,
Have a good day as I annoy, oi.

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyler, the Creator]
Cameras with panorama's views
My shoes have seen more vans than Mexicanas with crackers in Alabama
G-O-to the-L-F, this O-F, I open a store so I don't stress
But nigga I, (What?), mosh in gardens, jazz punk shit
Playing chords, making up shit, pardon my Dolly Parton's
And I keep sharting, hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten

[Interlude: Frank Ocean, Tyler, the Creator]
My bitch was on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch was on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind

My bitch was on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch was on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
My cool summer never ends

Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater

[Frank Ocean]
Oh my god.. I guess you're a cool guy
You're talking to a fucking bike, loser
(haha)
Oh... Fuck.


[Intro - Tallulah]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!

[Verse 1 - Tyler, The Creator:]
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? (Umm)
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nigga
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I'm calling your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned

[Hook - Tallulah and Tyler, The Creator:]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 2 - Tyler, The Creator:]
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48", motherfucka I'm great
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike tire
Never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now!"

[Hook - Tallulah and Tyler, The Creator:]
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 3 - Tyler, The Creator:]
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch Suck Dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, Iâm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, Iâm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos

[Hook 2 - Tallulah & Tyler, The Creator:]
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na na na na na na na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na na na na na na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
Can't agree? Bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

[Verse 4 - Tyler, The Creator:]
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
Shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me
Up and down, the friction makes a squeaky sound, the shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing like...

[Outro:]
[Wolf:] Oh, shit, aw fuck
[Clancy:] What the fuck!
[Wolf:] Aw, I'm sorry
[Clancy:] Is that my shirt?
[Wolf:] Yeah, sorry, I needed something
[Clancy:] Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!


[Na'kel, Tyler, The Creator, Lee Spielman:]
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes--
Hold on, hold on, hold on, run that shit back!
(This is a DJ Stankdady exclusive!)

Trashwang! Woah!
Illegal CIV!
Trashwang! Yo!

[Nakel:]

Big dog, cup full of egg nog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes
They just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow
Pusha Georgia trip, bitch I got it poppin'

Hoes see the board be a lotta boxes
Bitches see the boy and they mouth be frothing
Chain is glossing

[Tyler the Creator:]
Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, yeah, them niggas is swell
Tighter than a straight nigga going to jail
Locked in a box, nigga, off them socks
I can finally afford the bail
My bitch isn't bad
She's pretty normal looking with a real nice ass
Now hop off my dick, what it be
Bitch, Mob, Task, Force, Lil, B, nigga
Speaking of the devil
Y'all niggas cornier than kettle
Y'all couldn't smoke crack or heroin
In a Black Ops plane and reach my level
Ate some bugs and I made some carats
Fuck y'all niggas' bullshit, y'all cherish
I'm 21, I threw a party butâ¦
Difference is, y'all didn't have a Ferris
Wheel

[Jasper:]
55 grams in that blunt, nigga

Get chipped like that nigga from Stomp The Yard
Don't fuck with Jasper

[Tyler the Creator:]
Might fuck around and be a goat named Felicia
Sorry, got a little excited

You should call me

You should call me, oh
911
Call me
911

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemon, ayy, I need a BeyoncÃ©
Can't see straight, these shades are CÃ©line Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that 911

[Steve Lacy:] Call me some time
[Kilo Kish:] Ring, ring, ring
[Steve Lacy:] Please bling my line, you know I'll answer

[Frank Ocean:]
Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the burbs, burbs
With the the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial 9

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgunnin' the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancin' to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911

["Lonely":]

[ScHoolboy Q:] I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
[Tyler, The Creator:]
Old lonely ass nigga... need to go and get some bitches or something
[ScHoolboy Q:] I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
[Tyler, The Creator:] Weird ass nigga
[ScHoolboy Q:]
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
I can't even lie, I've been
[Tyler, The Creator:] Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (it's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like a 'Lardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call it charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really sorry, call me auto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been feelin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Goin' backdoors and at door
My partner is a chateau
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I can find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that 911

Oh! Damn! Damn!


[Rex Orange County & Corinne Bailey:]
When you're having fun, fun

Cause boredom got a new best friend
Boredom got a new best friend
Na na na...

(Find some time, oh)

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boredom, boredom, boredom, boredom
Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to dry wall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored."

[Rex Orange County & Anna of the North:]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something
Find some time
Find some time to do something

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Bored and getting desperate as hell
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
Cause I havenât seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
(Morning, oh, what the fuck?)
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
And sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' going
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
(Damn, gotta get outta here)

[Rex Orange County, Anna of the North & Tyler, The Creator:]
Find some time
Find some time to do something
(Hey, can y'all help me right quick?)
Find some time

Gonna find some, find some time

[Shane Powers:]
"Ride's over, we got some tickets to see s.."


[Lil Wayne:]
Moolah!
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my sea
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' C's like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties, if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know sticky fingaz
Some dropped science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler, named the song flower
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down

[Tyler, The Creator & Lil Wayne:]
Droppin' seeds on these niggas
They can't fuck with the boy (Mula!)
Droppin' seeds on these bitches
For the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden
Flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker
Weezy Baby the boy! Yugh!


[Tyler, The Creator:]
How many cars can I buy 'til I run out of drive?
How much drive can I have 'til I run out of road?
How much road can they pave 'til they run out of land?
How much land can there be until I run in the ocean?
You niggas go with the motions and all the plans
Sea I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows and posies
Falling outta my pocket, but ya'll want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until I turn on the AC?
If the AC blows, well then I'm TNT, I'm gone

[Rex Orange County:]
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Shout out to the girls that I lead on
For occasional head and always keeping my bed warm
And trying their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keeping me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be 'til them Black lives matter?
Niggas click clack splatter, pew, pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm driving is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if those ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in

[Rex Orange County:]
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? (Baby, then I'll know)
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know


[Estelle:]
Don't kill the rose
Boy, it could move
Love every flower
Out the cocoon

[Tyler, The Creator:]
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah

[Estelle & Tyler, The Creator:]
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed

[Estelle:]
Don't kill the rose
Boy, it could move
Love every flower
Out the cocoon

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garÃ§ons
Them feelings I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the base 10
Polka dot knows, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies when I float
I was always like eh
Barely interested, but I bag just to brag to my boys like bruh
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder
Tryna grab the rings of Saturn
I'm a plant it by the time you hear this
Chittin' chatter, 'bout to heat it
It will not fuckin' matter


Da na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind (How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends

Firework, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I'm, I feel like glitter
You're the one that I wanna give my life
You're the one that I need to give my time

Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
Then bill me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner got the heat like wait
Got the shit, its all up on that head
I use it on myself on the day you dipped
Got that 4-5-7 track, 8 for me
Babydoll, I hope you agree
Because you light my

Firework, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
(How you feel?) You're the one that I wanna give my life
(How you feel?) You're the one that I needed in my life
Cause I love having you around (I love)
Cause I love having you around

Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo got it, memo
Your pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
'Cause when I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't (how ya feel?)
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me

(Please don't save me, yeah)
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
(Scum Fuck Flower Boy)

Who the fuck you talkin' to motherfucka?
Boy I ain't got tiiiime for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Had these hoes in this bitch lookin' for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, muthafuckin boy?
Boy I ain't got time

How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it

Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First... (Happy birthday!!!)
You bitch ass nigga yep, I'm thirstay
The little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with you bitch ass in the first place

I ain't got tiiiime for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, lookin' like a seminar
Who the fuck you talkin' to motherfucka?
Boy I ain't got tiiiime for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Had these hoes in this bitch lookin' for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, muthafuckin boy?
Boy I ain't got time

Nat Turner would be so proud of me
Cause all these (motherfuckers!) got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they'll bow to me
But, you a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
Cuz' you already know how slow my shit grow

Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
...

Been the man with a bigger plan
Niggas know the deal
When I set upon, bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line, I'll have em' like woah
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One need to See three Ms
Four, five, six years ago
Suck selling figure
Conversations with Converse finalized, 'cause Vans fucked up
I'mma be common, so you gon' need commas
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'mma keep sporting
All Smiles Over Here
Shout out to The Garden
(Tick tock)
And, I just handle all my business like a chess board
(Tick tock, tick tock)
And them golf boys, that's my muthafuckin' set boy
Hard to swallow like some thick soda
Walk wit' it, 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
Do the Skywalker, riding round' sola
And the kid skin sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from the ball like some big shoulders
Til' I bust like that 9 in your heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And I bred orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to (shhh) they gave a big loafa
Green bread, I be chilling like a clean sofa
It's that thick odor
Young money T
Young fuckers, black boy, oh silly me
(I ain't got time!)

Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a little flood, nigga pipe down
A lil uzi, lil boosie way I wipe down
(Boy I ain't got time!)
To be sittin' here right now
'Cause niggas dying every day
And I ain't light brown
And I-D ain't wanna give a nigga no pose
So I went and did a 12 page spread in Vogue
(Nigga I ain't got time!)

Listen man I'm dat boy
All you lil niggas clones, boy I feel dat boy
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them figures and that gap tooth
Tick tock
Tick tock
Tick tock
"Fuck... Hello"


Say some more, never want to talk about it
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah
Feel a way, woah...

Take me back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

What if Clancy fuckin' me over?
What if 'Who Dat Boy' is rhetorical and this shit is over?
What if I'm hustling backwards?
What if my accountant ain't payin' my taxes?
Fillin' his pockets and IRS show up asking me questions
I couldn't answer 'cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day ones turn to three, fours cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across the Bank of America
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year in total, I put out two verses
But five seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh is it really? Oh is it really? Bitch you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars so whats they ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer '06, I remember the...
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last?
Let me pull over, quick!

And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, wassup
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the Winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup

My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November was performing with Lil Wayne
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when my brother took me to first concert ever...
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014 Miami 43rd Street, everyday was November

Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
"My November is right now"

I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
I consider my heart rate has slowed down at the ending
Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance, the lyrics
Matter of fact, I'mma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback

Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone...


[Tyler, The Creator:]
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues, like how I ain't notice that?
(How I ain't see that?) Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuff in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck (skrrt)
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awk..
-Ward, and I heard through some words that you off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared 'cause y'all threw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga

[Jaden Smith & Tyler, The Creator:]
I had to switch the gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch the gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I draw my piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
All I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga

[Jaden Smith & Tyler, The Creator:]
I had to switch the gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mir' on 'em (skrrrrrt!)
I had to switch the gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes


[Tyler, The Creator:]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, oh

You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Anytime I count sheep
That's the only time we make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
I don't wanna wake up

[Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis:]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, I
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
I don't know if I'ma see you again
(Uh, switch it up)

[Tyler, The Creator:]
I said, okay, okay, okay, okie dokie, my infatuation
Is translatin' to another form of what you call it? â Love
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'fore I stop the chasing, like a alcoholic
You don't understand me, what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose tinted cheeks, yeah it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Yeugh!

[Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis:]
20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways
When you cross my mind, I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my day dreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
(So)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Oh, forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war (Go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to)
I don't know if I'ma see you again

[Tyler, The Creator & Kali Uchis:]
Okay, okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay, oh
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la la
One more time?


Sometimes, I sit in my room

"It's Golf Radio, you're on the air with Shane Powers
Taking requests... What's uh... What's your name?
Hello? Um, okay, well, since, you want to be Mr. Fucking Secret Agent, what song you wanna hear?"

The one about me


[Tyler, The Creator:]
Ayo
Let take it back to them day
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga, California

[Frank Ocean:]
I ride through California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp-Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Vro we off this world
(Yeah, yeah)

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I grow
(Let's go!)

Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold (Man, look at this ice)
Shit weighs a ton, water your garden, my nigga
(Stunt on these niggas)
Tell these black kids they can be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall gup with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man, it feels like I'm winning
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car

[Frank Ocean:]
I ride through California
These frog oval goggles
I'm leaning out the window
OJ shining on me
Simp Sun shining on me
Slick circles floating
Vro we off this world
(Yeah, yeah)
Run it, run it, run it, yea

[Tyler, The Creator:]
I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (What you say?), I bloom, I glow (I glow)
I rock, I roll (Let 'em know), I bloom, I grow (I grow)
I rock, I roll (One more time), I bloom, I...
(Let's go!)

Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloom into a tree
Took a little while, nigga making leaves
Keep it in my branches family could eat
Favorite color green, energy is strong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Dropping them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk

Ah, shit!

Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run it


[Tyler, The Creator:]
Yo, who dat boy? Who him is?
Him that nig-ga, I swear
Stand up guy, him don't need no chair
Well, where the fuck him at?
'Cause nigga, I'm right here
I don't shop at the mall, all y'all just
Dumb mothafucka
I'm a goddamn artist
You can give me some markers and I'll draw you a closet
And you know that it's GOLF
Bitch gon' and make the deposit
Nigga fresh to death like he got dressed in a coffin
Cons, overalls, and a striped shirt
The boy drip swag like a broken faucet
It's runnin', nigga, I'm runnin'
Shit, that cherry be the bomb like he ran in Boston
Won't stop 'til the cops surround him
One nigga jiggy and the other awesome
With his fuckin' face blown off, that's how they found him
It's Young T

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
[A$AP Rocky:]
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
Mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air like that?
Nigga who dem boys?

Who dem is? Nigga, who dem is?
Who else step in this bitch this jig?
Who else your bitch say got a bick this big?
Who else came through with a wrist this flick?
Nigga, Guess my pants, do my dance
Spin around, bitch, you can kiss my ass
Never seen your nigga in this much Raf
Still doin' math when I miss my class
Was it Summertime '06, had the number 9
Nigga, never mind, wasn't none but time before Vince
Had the Gucci gold tips with the letterman
Nigga, dollar sign was my favorite number at the time
Fresh freshmen 'til they skipped my ass
Senior citizen, don't forget my pass
Been that nigga and you knew that there
Make the dick disappear, how she do that there?

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dat boy? Who him is?
Nigga, who dat boy? Who him is?
Who dem boys? Nigga, who dem is, nigga?
[A$AP Rocky:]
Why you niggas feel like that?
Mad 'cause a nigga's neck chill like that
Mad 'cause a nigga push wheel like that?
Why you puttin' bad vibes in the air?

[Tyler, The Creator:]
Fuck the rap, I'm tryna own a planet
From my other fuckin' business ventures
[A$AP Rocky:]
These niggas these days
Actin' like some bitches, like they're fuckin' with ya (yeah)
Teeth is glistenin', Jesus, Christmas
He just shittin', she exquisite, bitches be expensive (oh, no, nigga)
And I don't even need attention
WANG$AP on the bumper sticker, fuck you niggas
[Tyler, The Creator:]
Fuck global warming, my neck is so frio
I'm currently lookin' for '95 Leo
My mom say she worried because I'm so I'll
I should stay in bed, but got too much bread
To make, she said watch my weight
So I stayed home and start eatin' some meals
Get out of my way, way
Boy that's McLaren, that's 0 to 60 in 2 point nueve, I'm gone

Fuck


[Hook]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby Ñould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 1: Hodgy Beats]
I'm give it to her, she wants that summer time
I'm give it like no other cause she knows I'm hers
Damn right she's mine, we both know it
So when we separate everything fine, her phone ringin' in her purse
Damn right it's me, I'm her nigga, nigga
Comformizing summer time I'm where's that drink, nigga
Catch us where the beach at, she wanna go shopping
Sun down after club cause she like to get it popping
Sangria on my feet mom, cause she likes to get it popping
No ecstasy for her but she wanna get it popping
Drop topping, I measure her pleasure
Then drop in when she get out of place I quantinize
She is my concubine, I am her porcupine
I poke her face her throat for taste, give me head like I'm on her mind
I know her analyzation so when she try to fake it
Summer time in the boat of love, meet me by the lake

[Hook]
I can grab the fireworks, the soda, all the cookies we can eat
Make you nauseous but be cautious, this is not Dawson's Creek
We could sneak away, fuck it, you could bring an eighth
I'm not gon' smoke but I'm just asking baby Ñould you meet me by the lake?
Said bring a towel, well baby meet me by the lake
Bathing suit is going down, shit just meet me by the lake
We could count the shooting stars, well could you meet me by the lake?
Summer never has to end with me

[Verse 2: Tyler]
I packed a couple sandwiches inside that basket
And brought some extra towels if anyone was asking
We should take a dip in that lake quick and then split
Then do something that's beyond what we both can imagine

[Outro]
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, grab a drink
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, look in the sky
Watch the sunset, we can watch the sunset, we never have to leave
Watch the sunset (There goes the rainbow)


[Intro:]
Awww shit (swag)
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future doin' some crazy shit (bitch)
By the way, we do punch bitches

[Verse 1: Jasper]
I'm swagging bitch, I'm iced out
Oh you mad bitch cause I'm laying on the couch
Smoke a blunt, fuck a bitch, in the butt, I'm bossing
Don't give a fuck, I'm never rolling Slauson
I'm fly bitch, I should poke you in your eyelid
Got the burner bitch, bow-bow
You dead bitch, I'm hot as fuck
I ain't never cold, but I'm icy bitch

[Hook x4:]
My bitch suck dick, like she suck dick

[Verse 2: Tyler]
Got the bops in the house, socking bitches in they mouth
See my neck iced the fuck out, we getting money nigga
At the fucking mall, 40 bitches on my nutsack
I pulled up on a mothafucking unicorn (We on our ponies nigga)
Wolf Gang nigga scream that to the mothafucka show me deaf
Golf Wang nigga, Free Earl better show some motherfuckin' respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head make your bitch massage my shoulders

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: Taco]
Shut up bitch, suck my dick
You fuckin' bop, you better swallow it
I got a chain with a fuckin' platinum plaque on it
Is that a hundred dollar bill? I'll shit on it
I'm all the fucking well, cause I'm ballin'
Your bitch work for me, she my dish washer
Swag on my dick, 30 thousand million, nigga

[Hook x3]

[Verse 4: Jasper]
You boppin' bitch, you like this dick?
We all know why, cause you's a boppin' bitch
I got a burner, I pop you in your lip
Zoom-zoom, yeah, I'm going fast bitch
I'm loud as fuck, I'm ignorant
Beat your bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurkin' bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy bitch, don't look at my wrist
Because if you do, I might blind you bitch
Mount Everest ain't fuckin' with my fuckin' wrist
Fuck global warming, this the ice age bitch

[Outro:]
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
[x8]


[Hook]
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch [x4]
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch [x4]

[Verse 1]
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than a mother slut fucks for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked her too, yeah sheâs a comeback
Fill her with a bunch of shit I purchased at the drug store
Four more door looking sluts let me explore
Till my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

[Hook]
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch [x4]
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She's a boppin' bitch [x4]

[Verse 2]
This little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasnât feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

[Bridge]
Now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we canât fuck with this bitch? (That bitch is boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what does she be doin'? (She boppin')

[Outro]
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'mma kill this bitch
She's a boppin' bitch [x3]


[Verse 1]
Nigga this is my cup, drink the cyanide up
Dope as fuck so I would really shoot a group of guys up
Deep thought, I'm often lost (Fuck it) put me next to awesome
Still can't tell the difference, just like Asians with their eyes shut
Butt fuck a couple rocks, in the Wendy's parking lot
Barking at the sight of light from my bright sparkling
Cock-a-doodle, eatin' toaster strudel at a nude beach in Rome
In a black-pink spaghetti strap, made of Roman noodles
My bitch is bad, mixed with a thicky ass
Get my dicky rocky this will end up in a sticky blast
Chrissy Brown, mask on my face, now I'm kicking ass
Life's a bitch, fuck college, mommy I am ditching class
I rather be happy then fucking forty
So fuck the teacher's lecture I'm having Sydney record me
For the 2Dope.. (They didn't like it)
Oh well, let's get XXL to write us a fucking story

[Hook: Hodgy]
It's sitting right in my lap I see it, scribbled across the lines I read it
I'm the fucking poet who knows it, you know it, you bogus
Comprehend the language, you scared of war?
I'm all anxious, we got the Angus if you want beef
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Slice the onions)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Put on the cheese)
Now that's a burger for ya ass nigga (Where's the barbeque sauce?)
Now have that burger eat it fast nigga

[Verse 2]
Fucking all, get you some, obviously intended pun
Same time it took, Jason Dill to get the stitching done
Custom made, one of one, sold out Roxy for some months
Ski mask color of a pickle just to perform Sandwitches
Started back in fucking London cracker children wanted something
They could bump and punch a bunch and fuck a face stumble
Now, moshing pits to breaking arms, Zombie Circus not a carn
Evil wolfs is on the farm and were all evil harmed?
Any sheep creep, quiet tendered sleep
Make a peep, fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking Greek
God, Bastard was the shit, explains why it never leaked
I am coming of my age with my Memphis Bleek
Shooting from the sky, the only problem is the missing beak
(Once I have my wings and my motherfucking chain)
Oh that's the black talking in me, let me down a couple cups of bleach

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, lick a couple pimple covered clits
From some stripping lesbian dikes that fight niggas
That like to rap about those dikes that fight niggas
Alright, enough with this shit, let's talk business
Acquire more currency, disregard bitches
Go to Shake house and plant Goblins in his kitchen
Then force him and his mom to listen to track six then
If he doesn't like it I'll just slice his fucking dick and
Put it in the cabinet where the fucking cookies and chips is
Take a bunch of pictures then post them on my Twitters and
Go to Jimmy Fallon like faggot when we perfomin'
Then a bunch of Golf Wang niggas start stormin' on the stage
In a rage that will scare Zack Rocha
Better get ya tanks before this wolf wars over
History repeats itself, I'm a O.F. soldier


[Verse 1]
Slip it in her drink and in the blink
Of an eye I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, cause last time
I attempted this shit the judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with a link, intended her to meet me
At the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skatin' rink
We be uniquely in sync, already fuckin' and we only met last week
We're both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was workin' for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
Well, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep that
Neighbors by the creek say that my house stinks
It reeks of a street girl, streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which makes meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up,thoughts plot and rethink
Now I get daughters and time in the clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up, too fit, my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go

[Verse 2]
Bitches runnin' round down pussy take a trip
Make you strip, got my dick harder than the unzipped
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips poppin' on that cannon, bustin' odd mind cannons
On the pill, is he real? Gaza strippin'
In my livin' room, Wolf Gang full moon
I'm assumin' mushrooms, I'm a necrolampoon
Not of Charles Mansoon, this fuck is endin' soon, because I'm ejaculatin'

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
Now I'd like to take this time of day to thank the Mother Earth
Letting the sun shine down on the lake while I fish the waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters, hell hide grandmama too
Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool, he on the loose, yeah

[Outro]
Gotta wash you down, all this gold is fuckin' bathing
Wait 'til you see semenâs swimming, baby please not pass on all these great wolves
Your body's near the coral reef, once upon a time came home with me
Then the next chapter left her upon my teeth
Fill your gills with goo, going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion makes this hammerhead puke
Gotta wear a wetsuit, canât get seasick
I love when you wear fishnets, you want me to eat you
Youâre fucking wet, fish


You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone
You don't even have the balls to begin with
What you need is me, someone to talk to
Uh, it's been a while since our last session
So, tell me what's been going on

I'm not a fucking role model (I know this)
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm supposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)
LA to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in the air, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pockets, so now I could go buy
A couple hot pockets and grandmom could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressures on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?

Made a couple thou and I just don't know what to buy yet

The Preme shit is free, and I don't drink so fuck a wine set
Nigga fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research
I'm the star of the group
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
(Bastard was good tho.) What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make Parade or Inglorious
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they feel the flavor

People excited thinking shit is so tight (for what?)
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic
And start jacksing him off until his cack blasting off?
Fuck that, these niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the immortal of tech of the nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead that real hip hop
That's bull of the sheet but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it, (they dont, its not made for them) cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset, that same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him

Therapist been sinnin' and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me, cause I do not fuck with religion
You see that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear
Someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed his AK-47 at 47 kids
I don't wanna see my name mentioned

College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
For the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since 8
I can afford to get something my mother on her birthday

They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons nigga throw them at pedestrians

I, still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
Then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die (no you dont)
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee


[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler you obviously have some fucking problems
And this is the end of this session, let's anything else you've gotta say?

[Verse 1]
Mom is getting jealous I see my manager more
Than I see her before, I go on tour and it hurts
I miss the days when this was fun but now it turned into work
They getting legal, so now I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forget about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids that copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my mothafuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man
F*ck, I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing the new album, I'm missing my only friend

[Interlude]
When I say Odd, y'all say Future
Odd.. uh-uh, that shit's corny as fuck
(Tyler, you have a cult following)
To these white kids?

[Verse 2]
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nashes with the Nazis but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a lot tee
So while my wallet's piling with some symbolic colored paper
I lace her, cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy winning schizophrenic fucking orphan
Oops I meant bastard, a skinny ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about, taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard
Start a fuckin cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fuckin' shitty article in Thrasher

[Interlude]
I'm not crazy, I'm a fucking table, I'm a fucking table!

[Verse 3]
I'mma grab the Nina and find a nice arena
Cause I canât even choose between Ortega or Suprema
And Iâm not even human, Iâm a body shaped demon
With some semen in my sack and some problems in the back
And a life thatâs full of crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat thatâs filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse and the parents of the one
Thatâs getting married has a curse and itâs made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait it gets worse
All the guests thatâs in the church, all decided to disperse
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse
So they tied the knot, now itâs too late to reverse
This arrangement (Yes it is) and the nurse is amazed at the hurt
That he was painting but it was obvious in all the photos
He was paining, now a bunch of whispering immerse

[Outro]
And then the nurse blurts
(What the fuck is his problem, here, we have two doses to give him, here)
Why didnât anybody ask him first?
(Iâve been asking you this whole time)
Because nobody gave a fuck
(Someone gave a fuck Tyler
And, uh, the person that gave a fuck was me
See, youâre not, going crazy, itâs me, Iâm your best friend Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
Youâve been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends, theyâre just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC, see Tyler, Iâm your conscience
Iâm Tron Cat, Iâm Ace, Iâm Wolf Haley, Iâm..)
Me


(It's this girl)
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text, I get pissed when I get no reply

(It's this girl)
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating richard up 
The mental images her face looked
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on facebook

(This girl)
Video chats are so exciting,
Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible, and I just wanna take it like a pirate (aargh)

(This girl)
I see her in class
Not really two doors down, but any time that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, aw my shit's getting hard
Some thoughts of dating this bitch

(It's this girl)
Her name is my password (...fuck)

(This girl)
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches, they fuck
Are known as bitches and sluts
But she's special, I know to ya'll I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation, I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharin' straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holdin' hands walkin' home
I look past that, the fact she's fucking guys that I hate
But...

(This girl)
Things are looking great, cut copy
Last time that we talked, she said her relationship was rocky
Now that Mr. Fag is gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy

(This girl)
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in a cut at wendy's, but she's not alone
Who's that guy, wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her?
Come to find out she got back with her... nigga...
(Damn)
Damn...
Fuck...

(It's this girl) [x2]
She's so pretty, fuck self pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage, but if she replied
Or say anything, I'mma smile, I know

What do I do with myself? sit in my room for some days
Play xbox with piles full of wet socks, fuck that

(This girl)

My nigga asked "ace, what happened to such and such?"
I could slander her name, and then, tell em' I probably fucked 
Or I could tell em the truth and say she didn't like me much
But instead I lie and say she moved to nebraska...

(It's this girl...)


[Intro]
So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off

[Verse 1]
My only problem is death
F*ck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing her neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's off the Glock's cock
My hand's shriveled, my finger's slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she sad now, her son is dead

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 2]
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of the Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop but I listen like death drones
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
I know again I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, I'm kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, defend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mo Unique Parker, but a little darker, I'll see you in a couple

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Interlude]
Tyler, here's some water man
You seem a little tense.. how is Thebe?

[Verse 3]
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're shitty parents, face it, suck it up
That's what you shoulda did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bro
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm Poe-in' up
But I never had a drink, "Sydney, Tyler's throwing up!"
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feeling I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that I'm
As emotionally strained as Travis when he's.. (Tyler, calm down)
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5" about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit
Cause I don't know how to.. (Whoa)
All I want is her support, whenever the fight's at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis pad with a backpack
For the whole week full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like this house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends at
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, now I already want my life back

[Hook]
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fear
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems

[Verse 4]
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm blowin' them flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause you all know that
We at the fuckin' dirty lifer's laundry (Tyler, calm down) nigga get off me

[Outro]
Fuck off me man, fuck (What's got into you?)
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not (Yeah, you..)
As though I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man (Yeah, what's this?)
I don't fucking know, man (What's this person named then, Tyler, huh?)
He tells me to do this shit that I don't wanna fucking do (What's his name?)
Tron Cat


[Intro]
Random disclaimer
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay? It's fuckin' fiction
If anything happens, don't fuckin' blame me, white America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
4, 3, 2, 1

[Verse 1]
What the fuck I look like sayin' I'm sorry
To a bunch of fuckin' fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fuckin' Wolves that'll guard me
They skate hard brash black hoodies, try somethin'
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tie 'em up in a shoestring
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Hook]
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fuckin' radical, nigga
Left, right, left, right

[Verse 2]
Fuck cops, I'm a fuckin' rock star
Rebel and defiance makes my muthafuckin' cock hard
Fuck pigs, fuck guards, they all so fuckin' retard
Fuck school, I'mma fuck up, fuck Harvard
I ain't got no fuckin' money, hey mom
I ain't got no muthafuckin' daddy, he ain't teach me shit
Child support ain't come that faggot still ain't bought me anything
Fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Fuck your traditions, fuck your positions
Fuck your religion, fuck your decisions
See they're not mine so you gotta let 'em go
We can be ourselves, but you gotta let us know


[Intro: Tyler]
Nigga had the fucking nerve to call me immature
Fuck you think I made Odd Future for?
To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?
Fuck that nigga, Wolf Gang

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy and a blog because his music sucks? (I did!)
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts (Sorry)
Full of shit, like I ate that John
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 41k's, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen Degeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taked the nasty dick inside her alley you
The Golf Wang hooligans, is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

[Hook]
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, it's the Wolf Gang
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
It's the Wolf Gang, Golf Wang
Wolf Gang kill them

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you mommy, you could ride in hearses
I'm sick in the brain dumb bitch, can you nurse this?
You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
It was hilarious, well it ain't fucking funny now
I'll push this fucking pregnant clown into a hydrant stuck in the ground
I step through the stomach, replace the baby with some fucking pounds
"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks
I'm right back in it dead yummy and her mildew stank

[Tyler]
Free Earl, that's the fucking shit
And if you disagree, suck a couple pimple-covered dicks
Um, Wolf Gang, that's the fucking clique
Golf Wang kill them all nigga, triple six
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, all them niggas bitches
We don't need y'all, The Fader's who we really fucking with, bitch

[Outro]
And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box


[Tyler, The Creator:]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets (denim pockets)
On my waist, there's a black Glock (black Glock)
New girl moved on the block (on the block)
She been plottin' on my brown cock (brown cock)
Last night I slept over hers (over hers)
During sex, I overheard (I overheard)
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed then shot back, pa-pa
Blood on the sheets probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja with the blade and the mask
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nutbust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

[Frank Ocean:]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, swag, he's at your window

[Tyler, The Creator:]
The night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that sips on the punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We as including I and yourself, making three
Little ones drums beating pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

[Frank Ocean:]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window

[Tyler, The Creator:]
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous

Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with you cunt

I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place
I just wanna talk, and conversate
'Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place cunt

[Frank Ocean:]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
But check your window, he's at your window

The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in your bed
He's at your window

[Tyler, The Creator:]
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous


Rollin' in a golden Tacoma, the shit's stolen
If that bitch tell on me, I'ma do a fuckin' drive-by in her colon
With my meat, gotta keep it obsolete
Like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat
Fuck Jeeves ask me for advice, if I'm not reading advice
I'm squatting down, picking cracker bitches scalp for some lice
Everything that I write is dope because the pipe
And nope you can't have a hit unless you gimme the light
We be burnin' dirty rocks with a light switch
Bitch nigga, you about as hard as a dikes clit
I'm goin' as hard as Bishop Eddie Longs John
After I bought a Sidekick and sent that fag some nice pics
They say I try too goddamn hard
No shit, I want a Grammy you damn retard
You can't be great when you settle for flea bargain
Unless you're a thrift hipster bitch in a leotard
Painless, Hodgy lost his motherfucking mind because the brain left
Wolf Gang got the ink on me now it's banged out
Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out
Congress, ah yes, I'm fuckin' with the best blondes
Um yes, I am now beating off to mom sex
Raquel is wrestling a prom dress
While me and Ray Charles have a fucking staring contest
To all the step dads in here
Triple six kids got you motherfuck scared
Could be worse, nigga that's absurd
Nigga I am at Pharrell's tryna butt fuck nerds
This just in, Tyler the Creator and Justin Bieber
Was just in the room flippin' Selena Gomez
Go 'head, give some, pucker up
I'll fuck her up until the kids come in, umm
After Tron Cat I got the rat shook and I ain't even have a hook
For the white kids to sing along
I don't wanna sing a song, fuck that
Now cyber bully sissies on my little sister's MacBook
I got you niggas nervous like a pop
Tryna ask a virgin how a vegan daughter where the cock goes
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Rosco's
Head back to the studio and munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' in
Now I'm coming quicker than the shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around so Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Bead on my Johnson till my cock swole
Stop sayin' sick shit it's kinda old
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma you're a common cold
Have you heard my brother verse on Llama?
When that nigga's home, me, him and Hodgy gonna take the game and
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body
In a choke hold, uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' is all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black well
Malcolm X would be proud this white bitch is getting black mailed
Blue wide cracker named Ginny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fucking pennies at him
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth got some dick off my swole cock
Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old box
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on
Probably cause I'm goin harder than erect cock dick through a botox
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck thats left here
That's my ex bitch, heard she's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass
It's gonna be mid stage Coachella
Shake faggot ass keep hatin'
But I work hard for the shit that I got
So I still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth
All associates can suck cock


[Intro:]
Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Free Earl, uh

[Verse 1:]
Goddamn I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick dancing to John Lennon
With the red sweater jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don't shine
Bitch don't mind me, shake your hiney
The only motherfucking Wolf here, I spit venom
You're a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Ms. Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what's that? The cock of a black dude
Mad 'cause to start her, got the swag of a vacuum (Aww, fuck it)
I'll take her to the back room, dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cum will be bleeding but that's not from the time signature of the month, umm

[Hook:]
It's because I'm Dracula bitch
Don't got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
So I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
It's because I'm Dracula bitch
Don't got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
Til she decides to take Dracula's dick

[Verse 2:]
Goddamn I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes
Cooking, cleaning, grant my wishes
Make me and the Wolf Gang Sandwitches
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that'll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for
Is that four trunks comfy? (Fuck you!) Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy
That little bitch keeps trying to hump me
Jumping over dicks what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I'm allergic (I like your cape)
Oh this baby ape cape?
Bitch I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood target
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can't eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts
Then there's blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitches ain't hard to handle, I don't want a bride I just want bone marrow

[Hook:]
It's because I'm Dracula bitch
Don't got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
So I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
It's because I'm Dracula bitch
Don't got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
Til she decides to take Dracula's dick

[Outro:]
Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It's a full moon tonight and these hoes ain't acting right
It's because I'm Dracula bitch, swag, swag, swag
It's because, Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang


Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper nor a rapist nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our category
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours
(Umbrella) I hate this, screaming fuck patience
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary-Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler the Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yep
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
(I hate you!) Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border (arriba!)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
(Fuck Mary) I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga's sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

[Dr. TC:]
What the fuck?
I... I'm speechless, that was... fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a... fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?


[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you

[Verse 1: Domo]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gonna make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 2: Frank]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself and cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was great, all was great, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell, I was going through
And had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?

[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright mike, if your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we working, premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world

[Verse 4: Mike]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world

[Interlude: Tyler]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?

[Verse 5: Tyler]
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet but when I do
Clancy and Dave are to take a percentages that
Could pay the whole city's fucking mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot porn from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout (Can we get backstage man?)
No, faggot, it's sold out (Come on why you holding out
I though we was boys, without me, you wouldn't be Tyler the Creator
You're from the Derby, I can tell whenever you perform
A leopard can't change it's spots) But I'm a fucking unicorn
(Whatever man) Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams, and have fun"
(Hereâs some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none) How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
And they fear it when they hear it when that little fucker's reciting my lyrics
Yeah rebel nigga cheer it, dead parents everywhere
It's smelling like teen spirit.. okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building


Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

[Verse 1:]
I'm a fucking walking paradox â no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fucking triceratops, Reptar
Rapping as I'm mocking deaf rock stars
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper trying to get grown
About 5'7" of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'mma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is telling me that she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up) Here's the number to my therapist
(Shit) You tell him all your problems, he's fucking awesome with listening

[Verse 2:]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitching, this isn't a fucking hotline
For a fucking shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fucking working, I think I'm wasting my damn time
I'm clocking three past six and going postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nines
This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fucking broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?) Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing 'em
I'll crash that fucking airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver?
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need them
But where the fat ones at? I got something to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fucking leaves
It's been a couple months, and Tina still ain't perm her fucking weave, damn

[Verse 3:]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbing any blogging faggot hipster with a Pitchfork
Still suicidal I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fucking knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fucking hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved the cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just want to know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' Goblin
(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead


Uhh, addicts arise, when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag bag slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side, bitch
Reach for the door, get your access denied

I'm not an asshole I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screamin' "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf to me you're just a minor fox
Red ridin' is gettin' some of this wolfly odder cock

We the niggas you scared of, like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and Cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch, ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit

Your whole gang will be diminished, Bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape a tenants daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it

Face it, me and Ace's is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetary to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard

Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner

Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feedin' on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop! Will he though? Probably not
Silly hos lick my balls like FIFA lollipops

Get the certain tingle, eatin' Haagen Dazs
With some soccer moms while they like to fuckin' sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel

Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend a Snicker dick in a vanilly chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I preordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit

Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a hummer while I rape her and I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her

No narcissists, sippin' on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barkin' keep you up like car alarms and shit

Over the edge, yeah I had in a potato sack
Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fuckin' Traq
I'm the type to put you down and bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut

The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbin' your women friends, like a gentlemen
Then dippin' with the fuckin' pen to go sin again

White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doin' drive by's on a fuckin' fixie bike
Fuck it moron, snortin' oxycontin, wearin' cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playin' sissy dykes

This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes with, bullshit to stop, ho
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showin'

I hate gays, gangbangers and fuckin' jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers: that's fuckin' jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Wu-Tang bangin' in your system
Probably banging in your sister with my children swimmin' in her system
Let me say this shit in slow-mo, homo
You don't fuckin' skate, take off that Box Logo


This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought some food for death, go 'head and fuckin' eat
My father's dead well I don't know, we'll never fuckin' meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so posessed
This meetin' just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckas
Are much important I'm gettin' angrier while recordin'
I'm feelin' like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up on they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck 'em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album packs enough evil
That you can't fit inside a jansport, go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside of fuckin' week
Wakin' up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitchin' about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honour classes
By those slow as molasses, take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father like a fuckin' stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecomin', demons runnin'
Inside my head tellin' me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothin' but nightmares I caught, go to sleep

I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, some how the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is evil
My fuckin' samples are too illegal, play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or a fuckin' father
He died, no bitch, don't even fuckin' bother
I wanted a brother my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin' situation
That's havin' our brains racin' like Dayton, wearin' some fuckin' heelies

I know you fuckin' feel me, I want to fuckin' kill me
But times I'm so serious you think I'm silly
I'm doin' Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven. What's religion nigga? I am Legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talkin' 'bout Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin' their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad I'mma toss it eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's somethin' I inherit
My mom's all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Malonda decide to fuckin' share
This confused boy, I wanna hug all ya, Iâm bad for you kids to listen to
Soy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Drippin' cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fuckin name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fuckin', if I'm kissin'
But I'm sittin' here downin' beers simply just wishin'
With tear they try to tell me but I never listen
Cause I don't give a shit like sittin' down pissin'
Eighteen, still talkin' to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail


If this was a game
I already know that I would come out winner
And I'm not braggin', I'mma be in her
But this bitch really think that I'm 'bout to buy her dinner
My steak good, I got a good cut like splinter
Juicy and hot such a black bitch temper
Now she wanna talk and chop it up like a blender
But I don't give a fuck and keep her list'in like Schindler
She's cute but her forehead's big
Got stretch marks like she got four kids
Her legs can't close like the four door hinge Bronco
That O.J. killed the white hos with
A wealthy white girl without the facelift
Lure her with expensive dinners and a nice bracelet
Leave the bitch breathless, what the bitch don't know is that
I'm a muthafuckin' sellout and a rapist

Baby, you're an angel
How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow

If this was a game
I would be considered a muthafuckin' legend
And I ain't tryna gas you up like Chevron
But I'm high as fuck bitch, you really need to get on my leverage
Now we're in the cabin, in the middle of uhh
Tryna find ways to really stuff you in my cabinet
Dreamy little bastard, I done ran outta luck so now
It's time for a bloody foot you little rabbit
You're very attractive, and notice that
My hat is always the color of cactus
And I hang with wolves cause I'm an evil Bastard
Pictures of you on my wall no glue, no tape but just cum plastered
Met you at my school, departed at my house
Ended at your panties, started at your blouse
Pushed you down stairs, I took a nap up on the couch
If you wanted a date, don't come
Now you gotta make it easy for me don't run
You call this shit kids, well I call these kids cum
And you call this shit rape but I think that rape's fun
Wait now it's about eight somethin
It's late and you stuck in my base-one
Come downstairs with nothin' but a shoe string
Yeah bitch this date's done

Baby, you're an angel
How 'bout we turn this into a fable of some sort?
You already know you're dead
Ironic cause your lipstick is red, of course
I stuff you in the trunk, drunk
Cause all I really wanna do is fuck and snort blow

I like my girls how I like my drugs, white
Lord, you're so pretty, lyin' in my arms
I just got one request, stop breathin'


Got all the black bitches mad cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome I always X 'em
Like Wolverine steps on attackin' a deadly weapon
I'm openin' a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass.. ha-ha.. yo
I'm fuckin' Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three bear house eatin' their muthafuckin' porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy special effect erect bitches we bangin'
And please never disrespect my set with Canons
Hangin' from our necks like it's a muthafuckin' circus

You little niggas better check my French
You gettin' money better check my French
Ahh, what time is it, huh? Check my French
If you got my shit you better check my French
I make it move check my French
I speak English but check my French
Your ho be on my penis she check my French, bitch

I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard, cause every girl I'm diggin'
When I'm diggin' in her pussy, I'm never usin' a rubber
But fuck it I guess I gotta stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it drippin' green and red like double cheese buggers
Chewin' on cum like bubble gum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp, yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffin' blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that's silly ho
The most that they can do is find me, I'm hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
Oh no, Mister Stokes, I don't like misters, no
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go

You little niggas better check my French
You gettin' money better check my French
Ahh, what time is it, huh? Check my French
If you got my shit you better check my French
I make it move check my French
I speak English but check my French
Your ho be on my penis she check my French, bitch

Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all stars and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in their music and create the face
Of the picture punchline figured out, ahh I get you
No you don't nigga so why don't you go figure
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type of dude that choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump and the pressure is us
Bitches havin' eargasms and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo you better than us?
Digest what I'm sayin'? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
The Odd niggas are beginnin' to spill these pink hoes
We think sorta odd so we think so

Crusin' in my go kart at Walmart sellin' cupcakes
Go 'head admit it faggot, this shit is tighter then butt rape
That involve Ballpark franks and silver duct tape
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco you're probably drinkin' Cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watchin' Zorro, you homos.. O.F


My father died the day I came outta my mother's hole
And left the burden on my soul until I was old enough
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt
Bringin' pops to school today for twelve years I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring that dude to life then he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the weather like the fuck am I thinking
Birthdays, Christmas my only fucking wishlish was CD's
And a new fitted instead I got some CD's
I hated, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper cause I didn't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't go be shit
Well I guess I had one because nigga I'm it
You smell that? That's the odor of success bitch

I know I'm not the only bastard, in America
So I'm gonna need some help, on this next part, scream it with me niggas

Fuck you (I'm good)
Fuck you (I graduated)
Without you (I'm good)
Fuck you (I'm good)
Nigga eighteen (I'm good)
Fuck you (I'm good)
Got a car nigga (Fuck you)
Eat a dick nigga, bitch

Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts
Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
Now my momma mentioned the day before she would like
Cause she's playin' both roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon, I looked up to the Hugo's and Dixon's
The niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen
Pushin' keys like them niggas that were bangin' on the Keynes
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me hoodie a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up the years and the tears
And the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes
You fuckin' dicked out, I swear to God if I see you
I'mma get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out
Cause in 16 years, you let your kid down the existence, none
I don't give a fuck either like father like son I'm done

He ain't give a fuck about me
He ain't give a fuck about you
He ain't give a fuck about we
So what the fuck we gon' do?

Fuck you (I'm good)
Fuck you (I graduated)
Without you (I'm good)
Fuck you (I'm good)
Nigga eighteen (I'm good)
Fuck you (I'm good)
Got a car nigga (Fuck you)
Eat a dick nigga, bitch

The cold is nice, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather
The skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called
He said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck
Without them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up
Take it to the shop, then what?
Fuck it, mommas proud of her asmatic thin fuck
Luck on my brim Supreme keeps me warm
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white neos who's nero stays frio
Now this consulor is tryna tell me that I'm emo, she don't give a fuck
D-low where's the trigger, I'll let this bullet play hero


They don't paint pictures, they just trace me

Odd Future, I'm your muthafuckin' sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price
No bargin', nigga that's a bargain
Cow print t-shirt like muthafuckin' dog
On the muthafuckin' farm with cockadoodle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the freetime, I'm tossin' bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flyin' to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, baby, Milo so dope
The cocaine flow, niggas spit heat, propane
Niggas get the picture, I see, why?
(They don't paint pictures, they just trace me)

My nigga, no hook
No hook, fuck a hook

Yo, beside me, nobody likes me
Mainly because I am not a fuckin' HypeBeast
I think Supreme suck, we gnarly all our Nikes
I can wear some Wranglers, with a fuckin' White T
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag
In fact, my hat is in tact with the Fubu poor over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fuckin' rapper without a chain
With a four finger ring like I can't spell my fuckin' name
And I go to Obama rallies screamin' out "McCain!"
Them ignorant thrashin' muthafuckers is my gang
And the dirty Ladera I can't forget where I came from
Nigga, you don't claim none, fan I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a muthafuckin' zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter

My nigga, no hook
No hook, fuck a hook

(It's gold) The gold is in the back
(It's gold) The pixels in the front
(It's gold) The beat's a fuckin' bully
(Go home) The lyric's just a punk, man
(Gold) The pink is in the sky
(That shit's gold) The gold is in my mind
(It's gold) The mind is in my gold
The beat is turnin' old, so go

Synthesizer, I'm the muthafuckin' master
Nigga, I'm a bastard, I fuck with chord keys
Cause the sound lasts longer, bass drummer song
And a hi-hat made of plastic, nigga's sound is elastic
Nigga, you can bite this, unless you wanna bite back
I didn't take my fuckin' Ritalin, this is a hype track
HypeTrack that and send it, nigga it's a sack shit
I had you motherfuckers eatin' salad like a fat bitch

Drop it, Ace the Creator, O.F.N, bangin' on your FM
Ace the Creator, drop the drums, nigga, thank you to HypeBeast


Hello, the Hype is so Mellow
Bitch I'm dope and my pipe is so yellow
The blue polka dots, pink stripes and it's pink on the title
Nigga fuck your role model bitch, I'm my own idol and
If you can't face it my nigga, you can ass it
My accessorize accessories bring out my assets
Nigga they sound on acid, tablets
Stussyâs G-Shock with my custom pair of 3D glasses
I suffer from ADHD
I should win a fuckin' award for bein' me
Beat bangin' the tom-toms
My producer selection is fresh nigga, fuck Vons
Ace the Underdog, thrown 'em on the back bender
Cause I change my outfit more than transsexuals change gender
Eating Belgium waffles with Italian biscotts
I sold my soul to the devil for thirty percent off
And to you emo kids who walk around pissed off
Step one: pull your panties down and start to piss off
Step two: run to your radio, turn this shit off
Nigga didn't bother, so my father didn't help
So when my mom would beat my ass, she would always hit me
With Gucci belts, Gucci imprint from leather welts

I'm so dapper man, funky fresh dapper dan
I'm your favorite rapper fan, it's an honor to shake my hand
On the wall, tall on excursions, I'm a virgin of swap meets
I'm so pure, so sick it's no cure
I'm dope, where the fiends at? Aight, where the jeans at?
They had the cooler t-shirt at Supreme

And they see me they play pictionary
I got a good way with words like a dictionary
And in that dictionary my name is Bob Fresh
They at the same spot they making no progress
Becoming a good rapper ain't that easy
Of a process, eargasms they have 'em
The hotels we stayin' in twelve star
Tyler say "Yo Casey just write a twelve bar"
If I'm with twelve people, I'm with twelve stars
You haters what up, you Gods
They against us, oh no
Red and white diamonds, Supreme box logo


Odd (I'm a young man)
Future (I'm a little boy)
Wolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)
Gang (Let's parade in gold)

Welcome to the euphoria of cocaine without able
I can make music that makes sense, but not meant to be stable
Eighteen with the whole world in front of me
Odd Future teenagers, nobody can fuck with we

Odd (I'm a young man)
Future (I'm a little boy)
Wolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)
Gang (Let's parade in gold)

I scream and jump around on couches while you sit and talk
I skip to places, smilin' faces, while you fuckin' walk
My TV stays on Cartoon Network, fuck that Twilight shit
You have highlights about your life, I have half of my high life bitch
Go to college, get a job, marry, have a kid
Watch them grow and then you die? No, nigga fuck the system

Odd (I'm a young man)
Future (I'm a little boy)
Wolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)
Gang (Let's parade in gold)

Good kids make bad grown ups
Stay gold, stray old, maturin' means that your life sucks
In my wolf suit, I roam where the wild things at
Still growin', still learnin', not knowin' that I'm Matt
I don't wanna grow up, I know that shit for a fact, nigga eighteen

Odd (I'm a young man)
Future (I'm a little boy)
Wolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)
Gang (Let's parade in gold)

They say I'm immature, I say that they depressed
I talk to unicorns, I'm wearin' a uniform
Of a nigga that don't give a fuck about time
You live your life all serious while I'm enjoyin' mine


I was taught to act my shoe-size, never my age
I always judge a book by the cover, never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
That he felt when he dealt with physological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of posession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection

The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I wanna go outside
I gotta make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes

I bet you've never seen a pig fly, no
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven then we woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But If so, I'll take the scorn and indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet

Fatherless kids orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit

The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I wanna go outside
I gotta make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes

And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight
Don't go home tonight, chill, don't go home tonight)
And my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight, chill
Please stay, don't go home tonight, don't go home tonight)

I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hell, oh would my mama wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like Food for Thought was my father but I ain't had the hunger
My self esteem is like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall
I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves
But I wear mine on my head, Supreme


I like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? (Nigga hell no)
Fuck (Shit) and another one, there goes another one

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss

Maybe? (No)
Maybe? (I'm sorry)
Maybe? (I got a date)
Maybe? (Where's your dad?)

I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went

- Tyler, what you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm..
- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head

But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake how we eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious (I love you) I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah

Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss

Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe, but fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck, your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me? What did you want from me?


I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat, pro-abortion anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that minnie, blastin' "You're a jerk"
In some fuckin' yellow skinnies lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Bouncin' round the house tryna find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda poptart, when I bite into 'em red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by GB, if you got a fuckin' problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like a tiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watchin' the Berrics gettin' head from someone's parent
Blind fuckin' hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharin' in the force with the cyclops starin'
I'm flyin' on the beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no muthafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shitlist said that I'm nutty such cashew
Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit you can mention me if anybody ask you
Care to juggle with the cash news?
You didn't see me here if someone ask you

I wanna feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try to relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa

We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, themed when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
Ain't she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that we call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they fly


I'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxin' at Happy Camper
It's the fuckin' financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxin', I'm taxin'
"Fuck 'em all!" I'm chantin', don't complain I'm just rantin'
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in "Liar, Liar"
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, Cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some nazis, black nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, huddled and slightly tacky
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Endotherms and jaguars, drug dealers and crackers
Able students and slackers
I'm backwards like Jermaine Dupri in '93
Escaping from concentration camps with a fucking girl born in a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker Frannie
White, red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dyno like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck you bunches here, never disrespect my family
Thatâs for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fuckin' youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot

I guess I gotta be a fuckin' hand-me-down rapper
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fuckin' landing
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight, shout out to Hype Track
Them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fuckin' hip hop bloggers to start feelin' me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fuckin' skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfuckin' millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and cigaweed
Jerk with my friends like it's some motherfuckin' little league
No I ain't no fucking hipster, mister
No I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies, yo, yo

I'm drivin' in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fuckin' drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
(Shut the fuck up!) Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanish, I'll manage
Hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwitch
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot (Fuckin' Bastard)

Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didnât mean to offend anyone, alright, I'm lying, OF


We come through throbbin' like thunder storms
Make them feets get wet and funky up in they under arms
I'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwin' bombs
With the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on
Niggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms
Suck a dick, eat salam gettin' they nails done in salons
Hodgy Beats is like limp balm
If you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms
I got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms
Haters must be starvin' nowadays I make California Vietnam
And I'm goin' to embalm my creativity
Into a CD-rom, so you can feel this shit up on

Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, yeah
Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, oh my God
Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?
Could you bring the keys? Yeah
Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?
Drop the drums

=Pink chinchilla, cause I'm like Thrilla
My t-shirts are bathin', a bathin' gorilla
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda
But I ate that whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eatin' donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Makin' shit come like I'm go-go gadget
I'm mental, it's instrumental
Make your future therapist ask for dental records
And I hope this record have you stabbin' niggas with colored pencils

Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, yeah
Turn it up, where's the bass?
Bring the keys, oh my God
Turn it up nigga, where's the bass?
Could you bring the keys? Yeah
Turn it up, nigga where's the bass?
Drop the drums

Yo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces
You're feelin' life, I'll mug your teachers
I've got Muslims crawlin' on Jesus
I fucked Kelly, where is Regis?
Found Alicia, now she keyless
Cold as ice, and now I'm creamless
Murdered every bod from my squad
So technically, now I'm teamless, O.F. is so prestigious


Niggas at the fuckin' mall, niggas where my fuckin' drawers?
Think I'm happy? Think I'm sad? Bitch you fuckin' know my dad
He wears his pants up in his ass, touch his ass, grab his dick
You's a fag, you like that shit, O.F. is the fuckin' clique
I'm goin' off the top of the brain
Nigga don't know how to rap but I'm in the game
Fuck that shit, I don't give a fuck
I'm back up in the fuckin' club, niggas know I'm at the mall
Eatin' chips with my drawers, how you doing? How you fall?

Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina perm your fuckin' weave

Eat my ass, lick my balls
Bitch I'm in the fuckin' mall, with my niggas eatin' ham
Bitch I got that fuckin' swag, you don't know my fuckin' dad
I don't know my fuckin' dad, what is this a fuckin' purse?
I ain't fuckin' Mexican, but we can have sex again
With your sister with no rubber (Alexis' real name is Alex)
What the fuck? That's your fuckin' brother? I ain't with that jerkin' shit
Unless it's Steve Harvey's buff sister tryna jerk my dick

Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina perm your fuckin' weave

I'm with your girlfriend eatin' chips
Mmm, stop the beat, bitch..
Alright, yeah, nigga, I was in the mall
With my niggas bustin' triggers, yeah, swag

Swag, swag, swag, swag
Tina perm your fuckin' weave

Bitches, hoes, weaves, leather jackets
Bitches, weaves, hoes, leather jackets
Bitches, weaves, hoes, swag


I don't wanna play you, I just wanna tape you undress
And then I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore, if it's horror
Pop the pop corn, the thought to rape you really turns me on

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,

You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die hard fan, can't stop with the tapings
Sorta like a psycho when I can't stop with the raping
Of the VHS especially during sex baby

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,

Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slowmo, I don't wanna bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
You're dream movie, I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
Cause I'll kill if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch

Press my buttons baby, Press my fuckin' buttons baby,
STOP!

Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let me try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We can kick it on the couch, blunt to you, roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really wanna feel the room
I just wanna kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We can count the stars on the hood in your father's car
He's a buster anyway, I can take it him day
Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a just kiss?

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um

We both teenagers with the same mind state
How 'bout some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waitin' for that raw fish I can't wait, get it?

Can I sleep over, and wake up next to you?
I wanna feel you near, just let me whisper in your ear, um


Yo, I've seen a lot of niggas
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended
I get it, they try to keep a image,
but look a little closer at the pictures and you see that they chameleons
How you doin'?
You in the motherfucking building?
Nigga, I'm an architect, got another crane and I don't know if Imma park it yet,
you ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?
Is it cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?
I think people love to be mad
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion
Still trying to come out
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out
Probably cause I like to be in places where the sun out
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out
Thought y'all nudist, but y'all clothes
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt till the end
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with my friends
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen
Freedom of speech? My freedom was breached
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately
For shit I said when I was a virgin repeatedly
Posting on Hypebeast cause nobody would listen to me
My child is product of me, very honest
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards
Diverse and loud, so they ignore us
You put your life in a child that everybody hates
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one
(Kids?) Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating
Almost ate my spirit til the children cheered along
Watching them sing the songs
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong
That's why I rode the Mclaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer
"Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva
Nigga preaching and smiling, nigga wilden' and breathing
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him
But fuck that!, We want:
Cats cats daddy problems
Kickflip fuck fuck, cupcakes buttrape
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad"
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production
Saying you the plug, get your chords up
I was writing string sections on my tour bus
They adore me, my little birds
Be free flap your wings, I encourage it
I wish I had fucking xanax problem
So y'all talk about how I deep I am
Man-child in the flesh bitch I'm Peter Pan
You captain tier hook muthafuckas won't ever be the man
I got a muthafucking vision I don't need your plans
So shut your muthafucking mouth when I be speaking man
T the only sober nigga that be tweaking fam

I don't like rapping like that


Next time on Poppy Street
Good mornin', hope you had a good time last night
I need money from e'rybody, mo'fucker, better pay your tithes
Now I can change your life, fuck what's wrong, fuck what's right
What you want? What you like? Your world been mine
There's niggas gettin' paid over there
And niggas got it made over there
I'm finna bring the gang in the buil


Hittin' corners, thuggin' with the blower, barrel louder than a motor
Keep the engine runnin' when a nigga run up on ya
Another day in sunny California
The FEDs takin' pictures and they tappin' Motorolas
Everybody snitchin', gotta live with paranoia
A soldier since the stroller, ask my mama if you doubt that
Homie where ya clout at? You ain't ever push nobody's scalp back
45, 9s 'round 9 in the AM
Yesterday I sat in place, today I'm finna take it
A week ago, they killed my bro, that's been the price of bangin'
Since my granny Alameda days, robbin' cause we need a raise
Fingers do the talkin' when the Cs do the walkin'
And the Cs been polluted, baptism for these shooters
Seventh grade, I went to OCA, hoopin' up at Lueder's
With my Ru from Campanella we was crashin' shit together

Three, two, three, zero

3230 Poppy St, we ain't chasin', they brought the beef
Used to the sounds of violence, my neighbors ain't never call police
Call it followin' protocols, spark it if you ain't know the call
Got this bitch that live off of Market that's down to hold the heat
Turn the water and power off, got to send patience, powered up
Evictions notices go unnoticed, the final hours up
Livin' off of borrowed time, committin' crimes that's organized
Fortress ones and fortified, just tryna build my castle up
Got it in a dream, at night time we maskin' up
The deadly game of tag, the older generations passed to us
I got a clip that's long enough to shoot until the casket come
Wait until that casket drop, they droppin' when that magnum pop


[Hook - Vince Staples:]
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me
Birds and the bees, they wannabes
They'll never fuck wit' me

[Verse 1 - Vince Staples:]
Rounds up in that chamber, I'm a gangsta like my daddy
My mama caused another problem when she had me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
Stackin' paper, I'm a gangsta like my granny
It's money over everything if you ask me
They found another dead body in the alley
They found another dead body in the alleyway
I'm stoppin', poppin' like a shootin' guard
My seat is back, I'm too relaxed, not movin' out this car
I shot your child, so what, you know we wildin' after dark
The sun come down and guns come out, you know Ramona Park
Bandana brown, my skin is brown, I'm fightin' wit' the law
We runnin' 'round the city, east, west and the north
G check, better leap if you feelin' frog
You wit' the shit, getcho feet wet wit' the sharks

[Bridge - Daley:]

[Hook - Vince Staples:]
Birds and the bees, they wannabes

So watch the shit that you say, okay?
(Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay)
So watch the shit that you say

On 65 I tell the truth, no lies
The sheets and crosses turned to suits and ties
In black America, can you survive?
They made a nuisance once the noose is tied
We gentrified, we victimized, we fighting for survival
No hopes and dreams, just leave us be, we leanin' on the bible
They preyin' on us, prayin' for a better day tomorrow
Hide the fear behind this here bravado

[Hook:]
I wake up feeling like I am the coldest nigga breathing

We black scared for real, was bred to kill
Been leavin' niggas hangin', what you sayin'?
Don't shake my hand unless you're passin' payment
Keep your salutations, need my forty acres
Why they hate us? Why they want to rape us for our culture?
They greet us, feed us, bleed us, then they leave us for the vultures
They break the grill, get off with millions, tryna to break their focus
[?] the man to mow a lawn, the hopeless

[Hook:]

Big booty cuties be the coldest, cobras
Sittin' in the lawn of the fortress, coolin'
Baby wardrobe, all award show, bougie

Better getcho racks up 'fore you start choosin'
Rag on my face, hat on me say Yankees
Safe in the floor, K to ya dome, pay me
Watch where you go flossin' them gold daytons
Come to the norf, my niggas gon' caine 'em
Sellin' cocaine with my daddy out the Days Inn

[Verse 1 - Vince Staples:]
What's your addiction baby? Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck then get faded, fall out and it's all out war
Head twirl and your vision blurry, dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners, fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl you know that you need that raw
Girl you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that cocaÃ­na
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half sixteen
Pour a deuce up and then start leanin'
Tryin' to die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go (You know how the shit go)

[Hook - Vince Staples:]
I pray to God cause I need him (I need him, I need him)
Cocaine withdrawls and I'm fiendin' (I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin')
Life way too hard, am I dreamin'? (I'm dreamin', I'm dreamin')
Highway to hell and I'm speedin', one way to tell if I'm breathin'
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof
On three let's jump off the roof, on three let's jump off the roof

[Verse 2 - Vince Staples:]
Baby girl love me, I love ya back just don't turn ya back on me
Though I'm borderline crazy, mama crack baby, she just come when I sleep
So just hold my hand all, and don't wanna be apart of your problem, just wanna sleep
Without my lungs stopping like they used to
I hate when you lie, I hate the truth too
Can't wait 'til you die, I hate that we through
Fuck around and get a man, leave him dead, wastin' with the blame, I ain't playin' with a mufucka
I was raised at the end of the lead with the surf and the sandal, tan in this mufucka
Wanna feel how you feel, if it's mine, then it's real, then it's fine baby girl I don't need a rubber
Nothing wrong in the world with another mother (You know how the shit go)

Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

[Verse 1 - Vince Staples & JhenÃ© Aiko:]
I know it was your birthday
I know I didn't call right away
I know it hurt you in the worst way
I know that I would trade it all if you stay
I know I'm not perfect
I know that everybody ain't
But if it's one thing I know that I know, I know nothing at all
You don't pick up when I call
I'll make it up by tomorrow
You know that love is a brawl
So I'll be fighting for ya, I'll be fighting for ya

[Hook  - DJ Dahi:]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy
Really got me thinkin, about ya body

[Verse 2 - Vince Staples & JhenÃ© Aiko:]
Can I hit it in the morning? Can I hit it in the night?
And if I told you that I love you would you know it was a lie
Pretty woman, how you function with the devil in your thighs?
I see heaven in your eyes, I love to see you cry
The drugs inside your mind got you thinking different
Why you hiding from me? Fuck your inhibitions
Why you crazy lover? Think that you should be my baby mother
Let me slow it down, think I'm kinda tripping

[Hook  - DJ Dahi:]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'

Ass fat, can I take it out them jeans? Lemme know
Church bells sing, wedding rings, Lemme know
Baby girl I'm ready, whatchu ready for? Lemme know
Fuck the fuss and fighting, we should let it go, lemme know
Feeling like I need you, I need for you to lemme know
Nothing come between us, I need for you to lemme know
Everybody looking for that special soul, is it you?
If you think it's true, need you to lemme know

[Verse 3 - Vince Staples:]
Baby lemme know, if you feelin' right, you can spend the night
We can go, anywhere you like, nothing got a price
I suppose, that you wasn't quite the type who be doing it
Fo' sho, we can keep it on the low and take a load off
Soon as you walk up in the room, take ya clothes off
Bed to the floor, baby you know how it go
Nothing less and nothing more than what we make it
Consummating for a long time 'til the condom breakin'
Conversations in my head about some head, you got some commentary for a nigga?
I ain't tryna be too forward with ya, lookin' forward to ya
Tryna split a couple kids, maybe mortgage with ya
Do it all to get ya
So just lemme know

[Hook  - DJ Dahi:]
Pop it baby, don't keep me waitin'
Be my lover, be my lady
Other people drive me crazy

I'mma let you know, that I got that dough
But if you take a toke
You gon' be runnin' round tripping 'til you get your hands on more, yeah
You gotta be certain cause 'fore you consider fucking me
Cause you hit this shit once I know you gon' be in love with me


Hey, I'm just a nigga until I fill my pockets
And then I'm Mr. Nigga, they follow me while shoppin'
I feel like Mickey Richards, they feel like Muddy Waters
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
My momma was a Christian, Crip walkin' on blue-waters
Was fadin' up in Davis, then walkin' back to Palmer
A fro like Huey partner, Auntie Angie had them choppers
So tell me what's the difference, so tell me what's the difference?
I feel like "Fuck Versace", they rapin' nigga's pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, if Moses look like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aimin' at Nirvana
My bitch look like Madonna, they starin' at katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should have brought the chopper
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he lookin' at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

[Hook:]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up

We love our neighborhood, so all my brothers bang the hood
I never vote for presidents, the presidents that changed the hood
Is dead and green, was standin' on this mezzanine in Paris, France
Feel despairs cause most my homies never finna get this chance
All these white folks chanting when I asked 'em where my niggas at?
Goin' crazy, got me goin' crazy, I can't get wit' that
Wonder if they know, I know they won't go where we kick it at
Ho, this shit ain't Gryffindor, we really killin', kickin' doors
Fight between my conscious, and the skin that's on my body
Man, I need to fight the power, but I need that new Ferrari
Man, I breathe in, bleed this, Poppy Street
I shot them guns cause talk is cheap
Bow your head and pray, okay, now walk wit' me

[Hook:]
See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray Jehovah lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so please just lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up
Lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up, lift me up


I tell it like it is, and how it could be

Heaven or hell boy, freedom or jail boy
A Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for
The higher, the low boy, just me and my homeboys
The police kill us so we made up our own laws
Been fighting this long war, there's shells in this shores sand
Still young but a grown man, could tell by my stash
Been stackin' money and problems as I wait for the rapture
Death never been no threat, I be chillin', relaxin'
Everybody bleed

[Hook:]
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When I was in seventh grade my grandfather told me don't get caught lovin' the streets cause they never gonna love you back. But I feel like it's all we got so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from here, so they can't do nothing but look down on us. We look at them, we see somebody that could help but they look at us and all they see is a nigga. It don't really matter anyway, we all gon' die one day man. One day

Do doves cry when the black man dies, or do we croak with crows
The young catch gun shots, the old catch the holy ghost
Ho I love not, I never seen no pot of gold
Just ball windows and six fours with no switches
Was broke with no bitches, she love me though
You'll kill me if it make you richer, what you screaming, you my brother for
Heart is where the hatred is, the brain that stained the love below
And life is what you make it so I'm makin' money for my folks

[Hook:]
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done

When most people look at a person who does what I do they look at us with these preconceived notions as if, it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You're looking at a person telling them that they story don't matter when they're no better than me, walkin' down the streets tryna to shoot at somebody. Cause all we got is these dreams man and y'all ain't never had to have nothing, and that's the last thing you want from anybody. Is to not really have nothing

I been through hell and back, I seen my momma cry
Seen my father hit the crack then hit the set to flip a sack
I done seen my homies die then went on rides to kill 'em back
So how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?
We live for they amusement like they view us from behind the glass
No matter what we grow into, we never gonna escape our past
So in this cage they made for me, exactly where you find me at
Whether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back

[Hook:]
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make it up to heaven, despite the things I've done
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To make my momma proud, feel like her only son
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
With everything I need, with everything I want
I gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one
To do it like nobody has ever done


Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Know your sick of all the same old thangs
Same club wit' the same champagne
Backwoods, tryin' to burn your brain
Wit' a broke-ass nigga in the CarMax Range
You ain't nothin' but a vibrant thang
Ass too thick for your 5' 10" frame
Want to spend all night in your nine lives?
Get to purrin' when that liquor get to burnin'
Get it crackin', why you actin' like a virgin?
Where it come from, mama or the surgeon?
You paid for it, did you pray for it? Get twerkin'
And a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?
Why I ask when I already know?
Don't mind me, mind already gone
Nigga better not keep callin' ya phone
Have my dogs in the yard at his home

[Hook:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy

Girl, you lookin' like somethin' out of King
Magazine, fifteen in the magazine
Hope a nigga don't run up tweakin'
I'm tryna to have a good time this evening
91 Freeway, eastbound, speedin'
Late night but the face right, I need it
Mando, I'm the man though, you see it
Niggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it
I ain't really into clubs, into nightlife
Only kick it wit' the thugs, I ain't never did a drug
Weed blowin' what I does, need your mind right
They won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight
What your life like?
Would you ride for a nigga, die for a nigga?
Court room lie for a nigga?
Switch up to set up a snitch on a nigga?
Maybe, still gon' drive me crazy

[Hook:]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy
You know you drive me crazy

Siempre quiere estar en la calle gusta con amigos como pendejo nunca quieres estar en la casa
Tienes cosas hacer en la casa tambiÃ©n
Siempre quiere estar con mÃ­o en nunca quiere estar conmigo what the fuck
Yo no sÃ© que pasa hacer, but you need to get your shit together
Because a mi no me vas a tratar como ninguna otra pendeja estupido


[Hook - Haneef Talib:]
We might be wrong, might be guilty
We might be right this time
You tried to warn me, this war that would kill me
I sacrificed
Die to the world, I took the money
So for my life
Can't sleep at night, you shoulda seen the crib though
So fucking nice

Speaking on the unjust way the justice system is justifying crimes against our kind. Justice is supposed to be blind, but continue to cross color lines. Hands up, don't shoot. Shot. Stand your ground. Blacks don't own no ground to stand on so we stand on our words. Black and hooded is the official probable cause for cops to keep weapons on. I can't breathe through the chokeholds and gun smoke. These realities [?] and appear to inform black boys and men of the dangers outside their doors. Slain in society by sworn protectors. Protected by their peers, grand juries full of friends. No charges brought against them. They kill and arrest us, transgress and oppress us. Damn, cuz

They searching, they searching cells. Hold on cuz, (Oh it's the-) there's police in this motherfucker, you ain't hear them? You ain't hear the alarms? Three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine... ten, eleven. Another day in our block

Bitch you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurkin', don't die tonight
I just want to dance wit' you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, down the ave and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back
In the function, one wrong word, start bustin'
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shootin' in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a creole
T-scrap movin' for the d-lo, what he know?

[Hook:]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

Hit the corner, make a dollar flip
And split the dollars wit' my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem, playin' no pitches
Never no problem, sprayin' no witnesses
No face, no case, been wit' the shit
Hopped out broad day then emptied clips
Cut class cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know when change gon' come like Obama would say
But they shootin' everyday 'round my mama and them way
So we put a AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem wit' me
How I'm Crippin' where I'm livin', come and follow me
Pistol poppin', Poppy Street

[Hook:]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Northside, Long Beach, Northside, Long Beach

Nate Dogg still here cause of niggas like me
Police still scared cause of niggas like me
In the hood like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't wit' the business, nigga
Who you murdered? You ain't heard of Coldchain
Best thang, smokin' out the city
Ridin' 'round wit' the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, didn't get your back wet
Now these runnin'-Norfside niggas better factcheck
Frontin' wit' the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from street, they a nigga best yes
'Cept for Little Halftime, Brody bangin' five blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Crippin', Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, pop blocked a corner
Givin' hell 'til it's frozen over, I ain't never ran from nothin'

[Hook:]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend
And this how a nigga feel, and this how a nigga feel
I'm a mufuckin'

[Vince Staples (Earl Sweatshirt):]
One hand in the air, two hands on the nine when you shoot (I'm a mufuckin' legend)
When I die build a shrine on my side of the town if it's cool
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard
It's so hard, tryin' not to go so hard (I'm a mufuckin' legend)

[Earl Sweatshirt:]
I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend, I'm a mufuckin' legend

[Hook x2 - Future:]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get

[Verse 1 - Vince Staples:]
Fuck ya dead homies, run ya bread homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Beamer bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that dull shit
Livin' for that True Religion is broke shit
I can spend that on a Mac with a long clip
Fly in that Benz but you hide in that Focus
My nigga just focus, I'm tryin' to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner gets stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to domin'
That's somebody's son but a war to be won
Baby either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket, he called me a crab
So I shot at him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

[Hook x2 - Future:]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me
She better not get

[Verse 2 - Vince Staples:]
What means the world to you?
Is it a fast life, money and clothes?
Probably fuckin' these hoes
And what would you murder for?
Will your name hold weight when the curtains close?
Nigga caught one case and I heard he told
Snitch get a full clip and closed casket
Won't hug your bitch, when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shootin', no practice
Been tourin', whip foreign, coupe crashin'
Still bangin' 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clappin'
Kids crying, still snipin', no lackin'

[Hook x4 -  Future:]
9 millimeter, my brothers my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita, she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me

[Outro - Snoh Aalegra:]
I don't have a reason, oh but I
I'll get in your mind
I keep you loaded and ready right here beside of me
I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on your mind
I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on your mind
I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on you
I'll pull up on your mind


I ain't worried about the police
I ain't worried about these little niggas talking about they hold heat
I ain't stressing going broke
I don't never leave them residences alone, keep it on me
I'm the nigga that you quote
I'm the only conversation if you speaking up on Long Beach
Get to acting like you know
Don't be acting like you bold, get it cracking at a show
Heard the FEDs taking pictures, let a motherfucker pose
Tryna be the only Crippin' nigga sitting in the Vogue
Better put me on the cover, undercovers at my home
Tryna catch a nigga slippin', but I'm stickin' to the flow
Heard these niggas flippin' coke, why the fuck these niggas broke?
If there's shooters in the squad, what's the bodyguard for?
You ain't calling me collect and I ain't pickin' up the phone
Got some homies from the set who ain't never comin' home
You wouldn't know about it

[Hook:]
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
This'll blow up at you
Where the cash at, where the cash at?
Where ya pass at, where ya stash at?
Bend my last rack doing head at
Why? Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk!

I don't know if ya heard of me
But you heard them shots on the block, it's a murder scene
Go on call the cops, open heart, durin' surgery
Now his breathing stopped, stupid niggas should of knew we tripping
Now we in the box, Winchester's
Hundred in the box, Smith Wesson
Stuff it to the top and we coming to your spot
Knocking on the door, askin' where he at
Playin' games then we kick it down, everybody flat
On the ground, kids get kidnapped, go and ask 'bout it
Well you know how we rock it, nigga, you know who we wackin' now
You ain't never caught a body, know it cause you talkin' 'bout it
Catch me off [?] outta-
You a motherfucking street punk

[Hook:]
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
No one know about you
You a street punk
You a muthafuckin' street punk
This'll blow up at you
Where the cash at, where the cash at?
Where ya pass at, where ya stash at?
Bend my last rack doing head at
Why? Cause you a muthafuckin' street punk!


[Hook:]
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

Open up your eyes and tell me whatcha thinkin'
Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein'
Inside of me, where I be fussin', fuckin' up this evenin'
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meanin'
What's the grudge that you're holdin'?
Hold my hand let me take you to the land
Where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart, if we don't love then we fall apart
This could be forever, baby, I never seen you wetter, baby
Then when the tears fall soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm, don't make me regret it, baby
Cause if I never knew ya, I could never do this to ya
Hope you understand, they never taught me how to be a man
Only how to be a shooter, I only need the time to prove it

[Hook:]
Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know, that this could be forever, baby

My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
My feelings if I miss it's true
I spend my moments missin' you
I'm searchin' for atonement, do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone
Pick up the phone
Don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world


[Verse 1 - Vince Staples:]
Broke and all I had was my homeboys
Either build or destroy, what you going for?
Just a pawn and a plan tryin' to hold on
When the smoke clear why was the war fought?
Bout time you abandon the folklore
How you rich but your bitch in an old Ford?
How you black sellin' crack for the white man?
How you real, wouldn't kill for your right hand?
On the stand sworn in with ya right hand
It was all goin' good 'til the rave end
Knife scars on ya neck from ya best friend
Now it's talk, leave a tec' on ya nightstand
Leave a nigga dead to the world 'til his life end

[Hook - Kilo Kish:]
You got it, I armed it, you dreamt it, I start it
You're missin' the target, what more can you ask me for?
You want it, my dearly departed
I cocked back and shot it, what more can you ask me for?

[Verse 2 - Vince Staples:]
More black kids killed from a pill than the FEDs in the projects
In the planned parenthood playin' God with ya mom's check, you ain't even been to prom yet
Sixteen, heard you wanna be a star girl
What he charge for the dream? Getcha ball girl
What's the price for a life in this dark world?
Couple hundred where I come from, how you sleep when the sun down?
I ain't really tryna judge, they be lookin' for somebody you can love
He was lookin' for somebody he could fuck
Took ya body, wouldn't bother with you none
Spoiled rotten in the bottom of the slums
Caught up in the fun

[Hook - Kilo Kish:]
You got it, I armed it, you dreamt it, I start it
You're missin' the target, what more can you ask me for?
You want it, my dearly departed
I cocked back and shot it, what more can you ask me for?


I want the life of a legend
Black heart and matching weapons
Got a thing for aesthetics
Straight shooter like Redick
We get to dukin' and that Gloc-32
Pull a Laettner at the buzzer
You a dead motherfucker
Hunt heads motherfucker
My momma told me I'm living crazy
I'm just being what she made me
Dealing with the luck she gave me
Money comes and money goes
The money's low, We run in homes
Only leave the garden gnomes
Take the racks from out the stove
Stunting ain't no habit
If I want, I grab it
Selling tablet's like Toshiba, Nigga
In my city, We the killa's
If you pull that trigger, Better squeeze it nigga
If you don't
Then we 'gon have to find your house, And fucking Christmas tree it nigga
Light it up
Cops roll up
Hide the drugs
I never been to prison, And I never plan on showing up
Never could be rich enough
Cause I grew up broke as fuck
So I'll never stop my stroll
X by the O
All for the love of dough

[Hook x2:]
Until I get my 97
Benz, I'm selling dope
So get a quote
The trap is open, Nigga
Everything's a go
I'd be lying if I told you that we got it on the low
But we got it out the 'do
If you need it let me know

What you nigga's know about
40's out?
Run up in somebody house
If they home, Then swing that chrome
Knock his baby momma out
Fuck what you be talking 'bout
We really bring these chopper's out
Like Fox 11
Harmful weapons
Tell your girlfriend
Call the Reverend
Tell that pussy nigga talking
Only leave his momma grieving
Never been to prom, So he can slow dance with this Desert Eagle
Understand my grind is crooked
TK with an SK
Load off one mag
In your car dash
Like an Armean with a sextape
Nigga, I'm Heem
I'm Heem
My wave green, Like Tulane
See more drugs than 2 Chainz
Talk more shit, Than two Ye's
Hall of fame shooter
Wig scuffing, Six buffing
And my threat is a promise
I ain't one bit bluffing
I'm in one big room filled with abused substance
Sell, Recieved, Paid, Then Pon De Replay
Never seen D-Day
Watch that 16 Spray
Leave 16 dead, Buried on the east (Camouflage Hummer Radio)

[Hook x2]


(Speak!)
Well, it ain't no fun if the homies can't run
Train on a dame that they met up at Chili's
She need good dick, so I make her pop a wheelie
Wristwatch T-Bos, diamonds chilly
Silly bitch, fuck you and your TLC
Go and fetch me a sandwich, a BLT
No lettuce or tomato, but double on the bacon
After that, collect your shit, you need to get to shaking
Silly bitch
Ugh, I wouldn't call myself a chauvinist
You just a dumb slut who can't accept my openness
Hopeless romantic and such
You trying to get me stiffer than a mannequin touch
Manic depressive, obsessive compulsive
And it's hard to stay focused with your legs wide open
And I'm sorry that I'm easily distracted
But I got a thing for southern girls with them accents
Yep, I tend to think with the wrong head
So don't get mad if I end up in the wrong bed
Next to, a perfect pair of tits
With a glass of OJ and some Eggs Benedict
Over easy, sleazy, and you don't believe me
When it's 9am and I say that I'm drinking
Cause I really got a problem
And as my father said on his deathbed
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day
And weed


[Pac Sample:]
We thugs
And we nigga's
Until we set this shit right

Sometimes I wonder how my whole city hate me
When them the niggas that made me
I'm guessing that's just the way it go
They say I sold my soul,
When I never had it in the first place
Hades was my birthplace
Crazy is the word they
Used to describe my tactics
Of Islam practice
Mixed with my mother's lies
I'm just trying to get my piece of the pie
Before I end up deceased
Ain't no need to reply
When I ask them "Who's fucking with me?"
Cause I know the answer, Nigga
No love for the Devil
But for the moment, I'm dancing with her
Just trying to get my money up,
So that I can pay for my brothers
Cause at the moment they banging,
No point in killing each other
But I feel this shit's a struggle and all
That's one of the main reasons I'm not fucking with y'all
But I still love you niggas,
And that's on the hood
And all the homies locked up
Ready to die
But really
They'll never stop us
Unless they knock us


Never been a bitch
Hit a couple hundred licks
Stash the money at the crib
Momma going through my-

Never been a bitch
Hit a couple hundred licks
Stash the money at the crib
Momma going through my shit
Had to pass it off to Nick
Now we out in Carson
Went and faced a couple charges
But I'll never snitch
Empty clips on my enemies, Like I'm Pac
Never catch me on the block
Niggas out here trying to breathe
No point in standing on the street
Fuck what you see
I'mma make shit happen
My fam don't eat
Then them dogs 'gon scavenge
Ash, this shit Bracking
Nigga that's blood cracking
Blogs muckrackin'
There's nothing here to see
'Less you tryna to meet the future
Chillin' with a couple shooters
And the truth that's in this music
Then you must see
Me


[SK La'flare:]
SK
Vince Staples
Speak
Eat my flesh flesh my flesh

[SK La'flare:]
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties
It started with my bitch, mistress and her family
Whole town mad at me, but fuck it, I am glad to be
Killer, nothing realer in this world than a tragedy
Before I take her soul, I take her ears like Tyson
Cut my main bitch with my glove
I love to ball, I never liked them hoes
I couldn't trust them, so I hunt them base, molest they eyelids
Stalk their dreams and predict their every move like a psychic

Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Green stripes, red sweater bitch, I'm La'Flare Krueger
Nightmares turn reality, dreams turn to casualties


When shit get's hostile, Hoes get blasted
Bodies in the morgue getting shelved like Pac Div
Tell my girl I'm running late
Stuck in drug traffic by the ten
Two ten's in the Wagoneer
Nigga picture me rolling
All my bitches is stolen
So I mean it when I say that hoes hot as a stove top
Chrome Glock and the gold, D-Block Chain
That I won from J Hood in a pick-up game
Feeling like I'm Reggie Lewis
Shit I'll probably die a shooter vic
Run my mouth a lot
Run up in a niggas house to shop
Treating bitches like it's Camelot
Feed them out the trough
Asher Roth, Disappearing white's
Slanging half the price
Never that
You see my nigga's way ahead of that
Zordon, Big headed
Strong arm
Bench Press them
Been through hell and back, So my heart's been tested
Ain't willing to die, Your heart's in question
Nigga


[Hook - Kilo Kish:]
Old School Cadillac With the Tint
If Iâm At Top, Tell The Fat Woman Strip
Premium Vodka, Weed, and Girls
And any other rap shit things you've heard

I treat you faggots like I'm Tim Hardaway
God got my Nextely, hit me if he gotta pray
What these so called dues that I gotta pay?
Old niggas scared cause the new niggas got the Ks beat
Key Nyata made, caught the body, caught the case
Big poppa pump, pop the trunk, blow a cop away
They soft as Petey Pablo helicopter blades
Choppin blades, like I'm pimping Chad
'97 slab(s), Saab 9000, color of Spinelli hat
Straight out the deli with that big Mac 11
And it's for the beef shreddin'. John Lennon of my fucking trap
Can you roger that, Roger Mayweather hands hard
Hitting when I go to bat, you niggas notice that

[Hook]

Never fuck with niggas who can point out where your momma live
The shooters, cause 9 times out of 10, you lose her
That murder ain't a thing, got the Shawnn Kemp Ruger
At the trap off Hoopa, fully loaded when I shoot it
Feel that loud hadouken ho, real trill, you should know
Since my days at optimal academy
Picture like Maddux with a magnum in the black Ford Galaxy
I hope he rages, ain't no point in dodging when I grab the 3
Shoot the 3, Reggie Miller 93, 31, 32
Harold Miner quick release, run and shoot
So if I was you, I would try and pay attention
Niggas trying to catch a buzz, I'm just trying to catch you slipping


Uh
Time is money motherfucker, and money matters
Automatics make em' panic like it's East Atlantic
Jordan High summer school with my nigga Savage
Back when I was tryna' plot on fucking skinny Jasmine
Had a couple tablets we was pitching like Santana
Times was hard we ain't have no God, but we had hammers
Don't ever put me in a box with you rap bastards
Came from a different struggle, niggas had a different hustle
Never been suburban, piled in a Suburban nickel-plated Gervin
Hope they ready for that thunder cuz' my K.P. never on safety
Fortified with that .45 so who wanna' die
Just another product of my mothers pride
Smothered in my mothers lies Christ never died foe' me
But I know some niggas that'll give they life foe' me
You niggas can stick to praisin' and my niggas will stick to bangin'
If I die today remember me like Curt Henning
Perfect in every way
Now let the devils pray


Just riding around in a convertible Corolla
Waiting for the light to change, hopefully my luck will change
Went to sleep pissed off, woke up broke as fuck again
Being mediocre is some shit I'll never understand
Never had a 9 to 5, never did an application
And rather rob a nigga, when I get the chance, teacher's tell you
"Get a plan, go to college, let them empty out your pockets"
What the fuck I look like, nigga? For real
It's safe to say I put my heart in the trap but
How in the hell could you fault me for that when
It takes money to be shit and we never seen it
So I'm doing dirt, let the police clean it
Standing on the edge of a tall cliff
Trying not to fall deep into the shark pit
I guess I'm God's gift to Hell in a funny way
Can't wait to see my life change once the money came

[Hook - Mike G:]
Niggas only come around when the money's 'round
Catch you slipping 'round the town just to gun you down
Wasn't fucking with me then but I bet by now
These mothafuckas know they like my style
Tryna figure out, What the hell they want from me
Why I love everything that involves money?
Hope I get enough just tryna live it up
Shit I want yours too, you should give it up

She said she like money, I like Hummer's, you want to trade?
Just another disappointment in my fucking day
Slave to my lifestyle, would try and make a change
But I heard about the shit they doing to the runaway's
Swear that I would change everything if my gun could stay
Said she doesn't understand, anything I fucking say
Problems with women, she's tripping but get's pissed
Cause I tell that she just a bitch, and never really meant much
But if I told you that I loved you would you give a fuck?
Or even have the decency to listen up? Probably not
I swear like every time you come around my fucking heart will stop
Can't wait 'til I make way and the talking stops
But for now I just stare you down in the parking lot
From a far distance, just hoping, just wishing
That maybe you might not think I'm crazy
I know you probably wish for the same thing but fuck it

[Hook]


[Mike G:]
YMCMB, haha, alright

My patience wears thin with lacks of violence
Put the world on my shoulders I play it like violins
And sense, I really make none in present tense, I
Really write my lyrics in hieroglyphics, I
Really fight my lyrics can not be condensed
And the best will never feel the need to convince
My Army's offence exceeds any resistance
Be nice bitch, I just might let you meet Vince
The lights switch, so brakes are something I don't need
My reign roams, I'm Constantine with gold teeth
I play ours, realer than the words that speak in same songs
And I own every day of the week, I go hard
There's no telling where time goes
But my slow-mo flows put the world on hold
I roll like snowball effects, just watch me grow
I'm Jack Frost, I'm so cold my shadow glows


She was more beautiful than anything Iâve ever seen
Was the dream I had longed for, for many years
How it broke my heart to see her shed a tear
But she deserved it
I wasnât perfect, na I never been
So tell me why the hell was you expecting that?
Bitchin' and complaining seems to me like you perfected that
If I wouldâve knew I would have never got so damn attached
Found out that she loves me not
Now Iâm in this Cadillac
Please donât panic pretty lady
I wonât do no stupid shit
Just wanna be the one you love
The one you hug
The one you kiss
Itâs funny cuz; ever since you left I even miss the shit you used to do to piss me off
They say an un-tampered love is lost
So Iâm not downing you
Really though, Iâm happy that you found a dude
But anyway
Is the rope a little tight?
It seems as if your wrist are bleeding
And I hope the tape around your lips doesnât constrict your breathing
Not much room, but the trunks filled actually
Thatâs why I got you in the back seat, love taxi
Thatâs why I got you in the back seat

No
Donât you know I love you so
So tell me why you wanna go
Donât leave me
Alone

Sitting here, loathing in this ambiance
Staring at the shrine of miscellaneous body parts
I think of how we got off to such a sloppy start
And what seems worst a slit throat, or a tarnished heart?
I guess I got the raw end of the deal
Because this pain will last forever, yours ended in shrills
Now my lifeâs a nightmare, but it seems so real
Our love was full force yet you chose to yield
So we crashed, face first blood on the dash
I guess the best lesson in life is nothing that last
Fast-forward to this fucked up position Iâm in
Contemplating why to live, when Iâm living in sin
But shit, niggas like me, wasnât meant to go to heaven
We was meant to be alone, die, hanging from the ceiling
Tried praying for forgiveness but God told me to shut up


Rap ain't never did shit for a nigga with no options
You want some positivity go listen to some Common
I'm here to bring you knowledge that they left out at your college
Where you paid a hundred thousand
Just to fall behind anyway
All in the white man's plan to just assimilate
The nigga's if they stopped they business
Let the monkeys intergrate
Abraham Lincoln never kept none of my niggas safe
Only gave them prison dates
And Church's Chicken dinner plate's
Columbus is beloved
When the fuck will Malcom get a day?
Probably never, Try to hide the truth
But they hardly clever
Only show the youth
House niggas wear Cosby sweaters
Wisdom scripted in the prison
Letter's that my father sent us
Waiting for Armageddon
Still slangin' that Arm & Hammer
Use them Cop's as target practice
They owe us a couple L's
How we 'gon know the future when we barely know ourselves?
It ain't hard to tell
The nigga's got it hard as hell

[Pac Sample:]
When I say Thug Life, I mean that shit
Cause these white folks see us as thugs
I don't care what ya'll think
I don't care if you think a lawyer, If you a man, If you an african-american
If you whatever the fuck you think you are
We thugs and nigga's to these motherfuckers
You know
And until we on some shit
I'mma call it like it is
How you going to be a man and we starving? You know?
And we walk down and 5 different houses and not a man in either one of them motherfuckers?
How we going to be a man?
How we gonna be African-Americans and we--


I asked my mama what's the key to life, she told me she ain't know
She just try to take it day to day, and pray I make it home
Made me wonder for a second, til I felt my weapon
Falling out my pocket, then walked inside my room before she saw it
Never had a happy home, stability's a problem
Evictions from apartments, prison letters from my father
All a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray
I probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival
My teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine
Doing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets
Gave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance
Never asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand
The day my grandfather died, I grew into a man
Around the same time I first pulled a trigger
I prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care
As long as a nigga still here, right?

Never had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white
Same color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life
Sentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it
Why the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright
Knew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong
Till I heard Chef call himself God in the song
And it all made sense, cus we can't do shit
But look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong
You fix your own problems, tame your own conscience
All that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense
Not denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options
Cus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton
I prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him
Invest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them
And won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day
Hope that choir pew bulletproof or you gon' pay

Money was the motive, Florence, California, cutting corners
Trying catch a nigga slipping just to blaze him that Sabonis (what?)
Chamber long as Tommy Chambers nigga meet your maker
As-Salamu leave em lakeside, bells can't save em
When them shells start raining, guess my mama didn't raise me right
Too busy paying Christ to wash away her sins
But I'm the only one that's fucked up in the end?
That's the shit that happens when you put a book before your kids
The only girl I ever loved turned into a bitch
If I ever see her and I got a gun, she getting hit
That's as honest as it gets, I've done a lot of shit
I ain't proud of, but I wouldn't trade it in for Heaven
11 Mac-11's, and a Tre 57, bet that shit will get to talking
If you ever got a question
Never met a person worth trying to impress
So consider this a murder when it's 5 inside your chest


All the time, all the time, all time
All the time, all the time, all time
Aight, you ready?

What do you believe in? Die to have respect
I believe that the world got black neglect
Living broke, liquor stores where we cashing checks
Flipping dope, pimping hoes just to make ends meet
County blues, counting days till you get set free
Broke the rules so they shoot now we R.I.P
Live and learn what you earn when you cross them streets
Caught a case cause he wouldn't catch a fade
Living pedal to the metal cause he couldn't catch a break
Couldn't see the stakes, couldn't see the trouble come his way
I'm still waiting for the day that we black and we proud
Till then we'll be shooting niggas down to the ground
Sing it loud

[Hook x2:]
All the time, all the time, all time (all the time)
All the time, all the time, all time, boy
45 sitting side when I ride
If I ride for it, then I'll die for it

Fuck the world shit lately, black 380
Ready for wherever God gon' take me
On my momma I been out here since a young nigga
World tours and prison letters in my bunk, shit this life ain't yours
See, we fighting a chore rather, kill a nigga quick
Fuck the other side, show them niggas that you with the shit
Fucking homicide, let 'em see my ass upstate
Now they love to see me rattle sitting in that cage
Cause when some drugs get in the battle bet you lose all faith
I was born with a heart that the streets can't break
Never poured one shot, never rolled one J
Cause I don't need that shawty, point me to that bank
I ain't never had no money, nigga
Young and bummy so I had to be the funny nigga
Got a gun, started wilding like a dummy, nigga
I don't care about no murder just another nigga
Pull the fucking trigger

[Hook]


Bitches born with shovels
Guess that devil in disguise make you more than a woman
Felt the anger in your eyes since the moment I hugged you
Seemed familiar like a look in the mirror
You took a chance and I appreciate it
Understand that over time our word depreciated
But we can do it all again, waiting for you to say when
Give it time and a place swear to god I'll attend
I should've took you to prom
Fuck whoever had did but I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym
And you was right there, you was always right there
Forwarding your calls thinking how we got here

[Hook:]
But I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you [x3]
No I never said I never had love for you
I never said I never had love for you [x3]

Remember walking to your house everyday of the week
Nothing else I had to do and you was something to see
Red rose tattooed right up under your jeans
Still text you every night before I wander to sleep
Never told you this but you was why I went to seventh period
Truant student but you told me I should take it serious
Losing you is just another demon that I'm living with
Standing in your living room meeting your fam'
Know it hurt you when they ask you what had happen to him
When you see me on the t.v. know I'm glad you're my friend
Wish I had more but I don't
Never running out of hope really I'm just waiting on you

[Hook]

As for you I always think about our kids that you killed
Understanding at the time you didn't think we was real
But as a man I felt I let you down, we was on our second child
That you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile
It make me see the way y'all try to plan for us all
When I look back at my life I'm glad I had you involved
If I ever need somebody you the first imma call
Said that you would do it all just to see me alive
In the back seat, steel beats, tears in your eyes
Told me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie
But whatever help you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away
Sorry if you called me and told you I can't talk today
Pain in my voice when I speak in these songs
Same tone as the day I told you leave me alone

[Hook]


[Hook:]
Homie, I ain't humble, I deserve this shit
I'm from the side of the curb where the birds get flipped
So fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you

White high school, wasn't laughing at the black jokes
Daddy had us contact high off of crack smoke
Had to get it cracking with the 7 cause the Mac broke
Wrist fucked up, couldn't make it to practice
Had the money in the couch and the K's by the mattress
Chasing senior bitches down cause we was hanging with Pac then
Sidekick thefts if he pressed him we packed him
Ski masking, but niggas wasn't going to Aspen
Mayfair freshman class, but I skipped them all
But Miss Brown cause that was my nigga
Ask me what mattered more, school or the set?
She can tell by the truancy I'm true to the shit
Couple months I was up out of there
Mama kicked me out of the house, but shit I didn't care
Hitting licks came to a drought so we was killing kids all for the buck
15 sitting shotgun, ready to duck?

[Hook]

I swear I'm busy every time my mama call my phone
No time for stressing, she can leave a message at the tone
I apologize for breaking up your happy home
And looking like my daddy, all them arguments was overblown
Girl, I just want you happy, that's the reason why I write these songs
Cause I can give a fuck 'bout where I end up when it's said and done
Riding down 7 Street looking for your second son
Found him on Artesia with a Yannc he had a loaded gun
But you ain't know the difference, coming home late
Seen Tyson in the kitchen trying to make his own plate
But you love my homies like you love your only son that walk and talk
Think that was the reason why you afraid to see me risk it all
But your father told me no reward if no risk involved
And your father raised me, made me crazy, don't take shit at all
I know you miss him cause I miss him more and I can't quite recall
Knew he would be happy as the day my mama had me, see

[Hook]


I never needed nobody to believe in
I seen 'em change like the seasons
R.I.P., you just a candle on the cement
Once you leave so I've been trying to live forever, dawg
I got a .25 Beretta in my mama car
Same one my brother use, same one my father bought
Everybody telling when they go to court
I'm feeling like they don't make niggas like me no more
I still got slaves hanging from my family tree
The young still gangbanging like we WC
And Mac 10, Mac 10's sit up under the fleece
Because the powers that be just ain't fucking with me
Since back when there was white men under them sheets
Riding horseback, walking on the backs of the free
You see we in it to survive, what the fuck did you think?
At the blink of an eye niggas could die in these streets

[Hook:]
My life a movie, hope you liking the show
They act, we shooting, just a part of the role
The road to riches wasn't made for niggas this low
I pray for blessings, grab my weapon when I walk out the do'
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
Lock and load and I'm ready to go
When I'm ready to go, when I'm ready to go

Hey, tell these niggas let the black man shine
This little light of mine, a nine I hide inside of my drawers
Ain't nothing ancient, mama, ey lil mama, ey don't start
I only pray when asking Allah how we made it this far
But still I'm all about the dollar, pass the offering jar
The thoughts of niggas on the bottom what I offer to y'all
We from the slaveship, all my niggas ride for the cause
We on the same shit, tryna survive all the loss
Because they ain't shit, won't take shit but the charge
Because we can't snitch, know you niggas heard it before
A child was murdered before, he had a chance to mature
And bet the one they didn't ever see outside of the bars
We the pride of Raymond Washington, they washing us off
Them baggy Trueâs fit just like them county blues
Mac 10 match well with my black skin
Little black boy shooting up the avenue

[Hook]


As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
"Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!"
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

[Hook:]
Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

As a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand
Uncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams
Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man
Smoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans
Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

[Hook]

[James Fauntleroy:]
No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

[Hook]


Nigga, what's the deal? Pay attention
Most the time that I've been living we been public housing tenants
Never had no pot to piss so bitch excuse me if I brag a lot
Niggas never had a shot unless you talking .38 that Wak had got
Can't get passed them pearly gates, neglecting what your pastor taught
But you gon' smoke your weed still and you gon' sip your lean still
So I'm gon' hold this heat 'til they make me take my seat in prison
Doing shit my way till 25 to life what I'm facing, baby
My temper short, that anger made me have days in court
In my hood spill blood a sport and the killer's face can show no remorse
Got student loans and you failed the course
Of course you dropped out like 6 am and you see the cops out
Niggas been turnt up, no need to stop now
Speed up, skeet up then air the block out
El Camino creeping with your homies in your backseat
Once you hit that corner watch them niggas turn to athletes
Make him run his pockets, take his wallet then his house keys
Staking out his mama house, we taking every damn thing

[Hook - Jhene Aiko:]
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
Oh, you scared, ain't ya?
You getting bread, ain't ya?
You getting bread, ain't ya?
Ain't ya? Ain't ya?
(Nigga, where my money at?)

If Illuminati buying souls and only fear was dying broke
God who made my life this hard so hell where we decide to go
Could you really judge us knowing us then close to what was given
Father up in prison, Jesus here, but he ain't struggle wit us
The church only made shit worse
The money we was given ain't go to God
Mostly nice cars that Reverends could sit in, destined for jail
We just some niggas facing sentence, we sitting at a standstill
You broke, but you the man still trying to find your plan still
Two kids and mo' bills, food stamps and dope deals, hood life with no frills
But still they swear they feel you and never been close to near you
Once who preach protect and serve the main ones trying to kill you
It ain't no path to life, no prepping for no afterlife
It ain't no wrong or right, it's just the shit you do and shit you don't
Friends that's killing niggas is the only ones you praying for
But words, they never stopped no bullet
Oh, you scared, nigga?

[Hook]


Yeah, back and blacker than ever
Got sick of waiting for these actors to get it together
Still in them gutters, all my brothers is birds of a feather
Tried to get this money cause my people done struggled forever
Son of my father, gunning for stardom, it's worth a shot
They hate me like I'm fucking their mama, that's why I serve 'em hot
Shells they burning, as long as hell is burning Iâll murder God
If he was trying to fuck up my paper, nigga, that's all I got
The black and brown been going through a holocaust
You see Obama just a house nigga to me
They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key
It's empty plates in this estate so shorty shit where he eat
He got a clip, he got a K, he âbout to light up the street
They catch him slipping, now they trip him knock him right off his feet
His mama crying on the news like "that boy was so smart
Wish he never start chilling with them niggas at the park"
Been swimming with the sharks since the kiddy pool
Breaking all the written rules
Breaking the tradition of that inner-city raising fools
A raisin in the sun
They let the monkey out the cage, he got a gun
He got a book, he got a brain, you better run
Was the one that they shun
Baptized in the tears of the slaves as a young
A penny saved is a penny earned
So I'll be stacking up this copper as the city burn
Cold chain, nigga

Yeah, just sit and look at where they raised us at
Seen black, same crack, so they gave us that
Give us hope then take us back
To the 1800's with these rap contracts
And they wonder why niggas get shot, coke sit in the pot
He can't get no job so he hitting the block
And if that nigga getting money while them niggas sitting hungry
Ten times out of ten bet them niggas gon' plot
We just struggle with survival trying to rise to the top
When your life is on the line fuck what's right and what's not
You got a right to the dream, whether it's triple beam or Martin Luther's
My chain heavy, is you ready for that revolution?


Niggas die off of Poppy street
Bet my mama vouch, they drive by
We don't run inside, bitch, we shoot it out
On my grind, Benz color of the crimes I've been committing
I've been fighting all my life and I ain't stopping 'til it's finished
Rapid fire power sound just like a helicopter engine
Hell ain't threatening to niggas who ain't never had religion
In this field you Phillis Wheatleys ain't gon' never catch me slippin'
Serve that brick piece, now we sneaky, sell 'til the man come and get 'em

[Hook:]
Yeah, my niggas built for war, my niggas built for war
They sending threats, we sending shots
They sending threats, we sending shots

Fuck the pigs alive and dead 'cuz they ain't never had my back
See you black, 'fore you a man, and you a nigga 'fore you that
And that you'll never understand if you done seen it second hand
You ain't ready for that war then please don't step across them tracks
Rent money low and pressure high, no sellin O's just selling dimes
These California sunny skies done looked down on me all of my life
Is you really bout' what you write? Know they waitin' on my demise
And I been waiting too, my patience through, blue paisley noose in the sky

[Hook]

Martin Luther had a dream, I thought Tookie dream was better
Bunchy Carter had a plan, but they shot him 'fore he led us
To that Ghetto Promise Land, it ain't no hope for the darker man
Just the folks who you bump for the Arm & Hammer, the nigga prolly gone die when his mama had em'
That fleecy mattress fit 3 or 4, taking shit when we leave the store
Ain't a shoulder to lean up on, chauffeur in the back, the police been called
Same ol' gauge, same ol' trigger, same ol' cage, brand new nigga
Front page when you kill em', mothafucka pay attention

[Hook]


My momma cried the day I got put on the hood
Never wished for better days, only wished a nigga would
Never been a pump faker, that won't do your boy no good
Still shoot it like a free throw, hammers that the chicos get
Daddy threw it off the glass like a bank shot, shit
I'm just trying to get the money that the bank got flip
Like a monster truck, banging never disturbed me
That's the only time I see niggas balling without a jersey
At apartments we used to loot, them poppy niggas'll shoot
Homies taught me 2N's ain't need no friends
I need a black panamera with the black 2-10's
Told my momma I would make it so the story begins
Begins

[Hook:]
Trunk rattle like a body in that bitch
Catch a body in this bitch, check the body on my bitch
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live
Mafuckas talkin' shit til' you show up where they live, nigga
Got a whole lot of problems at the crib
Got a chopper at the crib since I hopped up out the crib, nigga

Tell me what's the deal, I'm trying to make a mil or somethin'
Tell me how you feel, these haters want a hundred
So it's cameras in the crib, cock hammers in the whip
Champagne for the pain, gram stacked up in the spliff
Blow the back out on the bitch who only want you for the dough you got
We know they know you know, but still we got them hoes up in the spot
Getting hot and bothered sinning in this sign of smoke
I put that on my momma, not a nigga living that stop the show
Promise that we did it way before we ever heard of rap
Niggas say they shooters, where your jersey at?
We catch you where you lurking at
Been to hell and church and back, all in granny Cadillac
Matter fact she had that Eldorado parked on Colorado
Called us if she had a problem, cousin Jerry had a rocket
Back when Common had you tryna to read Qu'rans and go to college
But forget about it

[Hook]


Woke up walking on water
Ditching my alma mater
Made a lot of mistakes from mimicking ways of my father
Father can you forgive me? Sinning since I remember
Back when grandaddy died, that was a cold December
They closed his casket while my motherfuckin hope was in it
Soon as you come out the womb they hanging rope for niggas
Groomed for the stone and the tomb, going for broke and shit
We've been that, push shit back, the Devil coaching niggas
Telling 'em to shoot, like a title on the line
When it's judgment time I doubt that God can look me in my eyes
'Fore He send me down to Hell cause I'mma ask a Nigga Why?
Never played it by the book because the Book was full of lies
And the preacher full of shit, and the teacher full of shit
Used to boo me from the bleachers that I'm never gon' forget
Eating $5 Little Caesar's pizzas on the WIC
Cause my daddy left my momma for the motherfucking pen

[Hook:]
But when it come down to it, know I'm out here shooting
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
When it come down to it know the basehead use it
Cause it's all a nigga got
Yeah that's all a nigga got
Find me posted on the block, cause it's all a nigga got
Couple hundred in the knot, cause it's all a nigga got
Still running from the cops
Cause it's all a nigga got [x2]
Cause that's all a nigga got

Our Father who art in heaven
Seen my momma dying every day since grade 11
You see her age is catching up to all them years of stressing
Tears is falling and her son too far away to catch 'em
Hard to call and when she call she gotta leave a message
Cause a nigga working
And I'm working so she worry free, guess I defeat the purpose
Medication cost a arm and leg, hardly even worth it
Doctor tripping so it got a nigga feeling John Q, wild
Round sitting in the gun, duck duck goose style
Pressure building up, nigga, what you gonna do now?
Brother kid too now, 12 years in the pen
Seen life end 'fore this shit begin
Sing it then

[Hook]

One for the fucking money
Two for the fucking show
.357 on me, loaded ready to go
I know my bitches love me
Know my enemies don't
My momma know I'm shady
I'm granny bastard baby
Look in the mirror like this is what you made me
I'm going crazy please somebody save me
Jesus way too far gone for him to reach me
To reach me


[Hook:]
Birds and the bees, come and fuck with a G
Hot as 65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid degrees)
Hard on a ho, drop your drawers to the floor
Gangsta God, baby get on your knees (Baby girl get on your knees)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (Block been hot 'bout)
65 hunnid degrees (65 hunnid)

Runnin' to get to that check, I'm comin'
Jumpin' out of that back seat bustin'
Buss buss missions with the blower as a youngin'
Back when Killa Mo
Had 'em coppin' Crystal through the prison door
Feel the 4, when I'm feelin' low
Time to stretch a nigga
Ridin' through your section
Shit, I hope you got protection with you
Hop out when the cops out
Shit, I'm cold with my .45, brown rag, green light
Yoda time

[Hook]

You alone
Car full of niggas but you alone
It's time to show how much you love your homies
One nigga outside, two niggas up inside the store
One nigga gon' die, the other two can come along
Gloves with the disguise, bang the set before you blow
Don't stop 'til he drop
Don't shoot for the skies or shoot for his toes
I told you before
That niggas gotta die for this shit to survive
Is you with it or not? Get to knockin' then
Problem is lot of niggas scared of the consequence
Common sense missin' from your head when the pressure on
Niggas from my home ain't enrolled in the colleges
Fuck a class, junkies hittin' glass
Get the money long
Gleamin' with the tints and the stash, no tags
Bumpin' poison on the ave
Gettin' cash until a nigga's gone
And ain't shit wrong with the truth, got the Juice
Would've threw that nigga Bishop off the roof

[Hook]


[Hook:]
New shoes with the blue suede
Blue suede, the blue suede, the blue suede
Young graves get the bouquets
Bouquets, the bouquets, the bouquets
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses
Hope I outlive them red roses

Bitches ain't shit but hoes, I been known this
Niggas gon' snitch regardless, Mitch showed us
Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof
Blowing 40s as a youth, Thump Deuce in the Chevy
Hit the corner, run up on him, turn a nigga to Spaghettios

[Hook]

Bitches ain't shit but tricks, I been known that
Blowing on dicks for spliffs and cold Cognac
Out club hoppin', hoppin' in Kodak's
Where the coke at? Love white like Bobby wife
Finna party like it's prom tonight
Finna kill a nigga walkin' to his momâs tonight
Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden
Nigga, fuck that

[Hook]

All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
All I wanted was them Jordan's with the blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em
Blue suede 'em, blue suede in 'em


I wake up tryin' to dodge the cops just like my momma did
Came home from school soon as I seen she was up out the crib
Criminal Minded, mind your business if you wanna live
Them niggas fiendin' for them luxuries they'll never get
I took a couple women's love for me and hit a lick
If she can't help me get up out the struggle, why I need the bitch?
I need a million dollars for starters, been sick of sleepin' on the couch
In this crowded apartment, them streets been in a fuckin' drought
I don't see the narcotics, it ain't no books up in this backpack
I brought the revolver, I'm asking niggas where the cash at
Tappin' they pockets
That pocket rocket make a backpacker as soon as you blockin'
You know the block is hot
Wayne tried to tell them, one case away from felon
Granny told me stay inside the house, a nigga should've listened
Been punchin' out their faces with the hands that I pray with
Money trees blowin' in the wind, I'm feeling the fragrance

[Hook:]
Is you feeling amazing? Yeah I'm feeling the love
Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done
Pray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done
And I hear you cheering for me when my victory come
Yeah I'm feeling the love [8x]

2006 I said I had to get my money right
Shit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night
Might put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind
Then run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine
College was a plan of mine until I seen them fees
Everything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets
Only price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me
Closely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie
Goals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep
Mom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave
Then this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds
Is what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?
Played a lot of roles in life but never played the victim
Never paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights
Mac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist
Life is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice

[Hook]


School couldn't get me into Heaven
And Heaven couldn't get me in a bitch bed
Bred 11's that I stole on a house lick
Got them hoes, whole Polo outfits
Feelin' like Young Dro, summertime '06
Thirteen years old runnin' my home, ya bitch
Believe that, we was thuggin' on the back street
Catchin' cases, probably finna go to Hell anyway

[Hook 2x:]
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway
I'm probably finna go to Hell anyway

Them Yankee hats remind me of my younger days
Dog was a maniac
My momma had me where them babies havin' babies at
My knuckles ashy knockin' niggas on they ass
For smackin', never lackin', road to riches is a path
Mothafucka watch your ass
And quick race, dawg, for when cold blood like Crips
You dig your own grave when you fuckin' with the Lord
Catch a fade, probably finna go to Hell anyway

[Hook 2x]


North Division tryin' to stop my blackness
I'm watchin' for them badges when out in traffic
Them 9-11's been a tad bit frantic
If lights start flashin', please don't panic
The DEA givin' out gang enhancements
Can barely even hang to build a case off cameras
CCAT trackin' criminal patterns
Trickin' niggas into takin' strikes to get out faster
Freedom bribery nigga, cause we hardly acquit
Social media that leave the flash photography snitchin'
Blame geography nigga, for the pride in these niggas
Take you when they fingerprint you, now you part of the system
This was all a part of Huey P. and Bobby prediction
Makin' profit off of violence, they arousin' attention
Leaders risin' lead to twenty-five to life in the prison
Better watch it cause I know they got a spot for you nigga

[Hook 2X:]
Yeah, put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Nigga freeze, put your hands in the air

Deangelo Lopez and Tyler Woods
Just a couple they gunned down around the hood
I guess the pigs split wigs for the greater good
Cause I ain't seen them lock a swine up yet
At the most they reassign 'em to prevent protest
Just your color is enough to get you under arrest
Strong hand to the law got me feelin' oppressed
If you flippin', kill a fifty, then you get in a chair
Payin' taxes for some fuckin' clowns to ride around
Whoopin' niggas asses, scared to man up
Handcuffs givin' niggas gashes on the wrist
I used to lift my fist to fight the power with
Older homie told me in his day the pigs was plantin' bricks
In the trunks of nigga's Chevrolets them traffic stops and shit
Raidin' homes without a warrant
Shoot him first without a warning
And they expect respect and non-violence
I refuse the right to be silent

[Hook 2X]

LBPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LAPD, no they ain't 'bout shit
LASD, no they ain't 'bout shit
Ridin' 'round these streets givin' out full clips
[X2]

[Hook 2X]


[Hook - Teyana Taylor:]
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you
I can love you better

Bitches think they livin' in a dream 'til I wake 'em up
Faded off the liquor, limousines waiting in the front
Looking for a nigga with the green shinin' in the club
Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want
18 years with a check coming every month
Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

[Bridge:]
So you love and you lose it
She don't wanna devolve
Keep your heart in your chest
And your head in the stars
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost
Fall in love and get lost

[Hook 2 - Teyana Taylor:]
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you (I can love you)
I can love you better

He don't love her at all, but he fuckin' her raw
Tales of Adam and Eve birthin' a bitch and a dog
How you follow a heart colder than winter in Prague
Love for the wealth and the self, her mind full of everything else
The Bible she hide in the shelf, doubt she ever open it
Lost in the world, just tryin' to figure where to go from here
Wonder what her motive is, she wonder what your focus is
Every man she ever felt done lied and left her to herself
Scared of the future, runnin' from the past
Like she's starin' in the grave while you starin' at her ass
Young, dumb in the brave heart, numb from the pain
Eyes strain from the tears, yeah, she stuck in her ways

[Bridge]

[Hook 2 x2]


What's the word, what's the word, what's the word?
You are now about to witness the strength of narcotics

[Hook 2x:]
Who's that peekin' in my screen door?
I got what you need, what you fiend for?

Bobby Johnson ain't my OG, this ain't no movie, bro
Pop's was off that O.E trippin' gettin' his Tookie on
Thunderbird with Gold D's, a felon and parolee
McDonald's for the Double Cheese, pockets fit a couple C-Notes
Up on the screen, Dolce in the pack it up and leave
But we don't read those
Cause the money comin' faster than your bitch, nigga
All my life I wanted to be a rich nigga
But homie let me proceed
Pop's was moving slow poke, that's way before the codeine
Just methadone and powdered H to junkies with the sour faces
Knocking on the screen door asking for their homie Nate
Ten to twenty each, 4p.m. he leave so don't be late
Mom up off of work asking me if anybody came
To kick it with my dad or was he chilling in the alleyway
He was in the alleyway, that's what he always had me say
Slangin' for them bills he had to pay somebody at the door

[Hook 2x]

Pots on top of the furnace, Glocks on top of the kitchen
Table-tables is turning, now my father is trippin'
He shootin', sniffin', and sippin', pigs recruitin' them snitches
Cause testimonies from homies can lead to longer convictions
Police knockin' at my door, pretendin' nobody hear him
Police knockin' down my door with judicial system permission
Contraband in where we livin', hope I don't get thrown away
In the prison dogs are sniffin' backyard full of canes
Catch a case and not get out, niggas fighting every day
Choppers circle cause a nigga chop hard on the blade
Got broads on the base, slangin' rude, we bangin' too
Where you from?
If they got that back, we clapping coming through
Going dumb, 40's selling water profit from the slums
Since we was young money been the motive
Nigga get you some guns and dough
Bruh I love them guns and dough
Find me slangin' for the low
Come around, you getting domed, somebody at the door

[Hook]


I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"

Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked me in my eyes and told me "Daddy sure you right"

All my life man I want fast cars, NASCARs
All my life I want runway stars, Kate Moss
All my life I want waves at my front door
No green grass, no porch
I just want sea shores
All my life
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
All my life pretty women done told me lies
Told me lies, told me lies

I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

Eyes can't hide your hate for me
Maybe it was made for the Maybelline
Spend so much tryna park the car
Barely got a tip for the maÃ®tre d'
You head straight to the oyster bar
I tread light each time I speak
Play too rough might break ya heart
And them glass shoes ain't made to walk
These lonely streets
Unpaved, unscathed
Morning dew's giving you the coldest feet
Said that she was comin' through after dark
Look at the stars, they hardly speak
This thing called love is real hard for me
This thing called love is a God to me
And we all just got property
So feel free to fulfill the prophecy

Adam, Eve
Apple tree
Watch out for the snakes baby
Open streets
Ocean breeze
We should get away, baby

I'm in that 745
Hope I can come scoop you up 'round 7:45
Slide 'round with my drop top up or down, you down to ride?
Looked into my eyes and told me "Daddy show you right"

Sometimes you have to get all the... all the crap out the way before you hit the good stuff and you're like "OK, I'm getting good stuff now"
But, um, uh, I had a bi- I mean, the stuff I write about, what do I really write about?
I've got my weed songs and all my songs about my boy- uh, my ex-boyfriend, George
Songs about relationships that are kinda doomed from the start
You know, songs about when I fell in love and it went wrong
And I was so in love at the time, you know, I was like...
And I was with someone that I was in love with, you know what I mean? We were in love
You know what I mean? We were together, so-
When it- and that's like a real drug, isn't it? So when it- when it didn't come together, I was just like...
You know? It really hurt
But I needed enough distance from it
So that it wasn't like raw emotion anymore
But not enough distance that I'd forget
I'm quite a self-destructive person, so I guess
I guess if you give me some material...

Raindrops on my windowsill
Longing for your nature's feel
Loved that song when we were kids
Now it makes me want you here
Sometimes, people disappear
Think that was my biggest fear
I should have protected you
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
Sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
Sometimes, I wish it would rain
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room
I know to you


This is for my future baby mama
Hope your skin as black as midnight
I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Oh father, oh the heavens, as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't blow me down cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now
Cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie
How dare you thinks it's different
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break, I dipped
The cash came, I flipped
I stack that, yeah I stack that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for bitches, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me homie

Boy oh boy and we are
Floating on the Dions
Go until they take my bro and em out them city CRs
Prison system broken
Racial war commercin'
Until the president get that, shit Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tomika's and Shaniqua's in that Oval Office
Obama ain't enough for me, we only getting started
The next Bill Gates can be on Section 8 up in the projects
So today, love my dark skin
Bitch I'm goin' all in

Gas break, I dipped
The cash came, I flipped
I stack that, yeah I stack that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for bitches, bagbak I'm trippin'
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me better
Bag-bagbak, bagbak you don't know me homie

They found it
Death close to 3, 230 feet
A deep dive, but within acceptable range

Clap your hands if the police ever profile
You don't gotta worry, don't be scared because we own ya
Ain't no gentrifying us, we finna buy the whole town
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now, we on now
Tell the one percent to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the government to suck a dick, because we on now
Tell the president to suck a dick, because we on now
We on now
We on now
We on now
We on now


[Juicy J:]
You can get anything you want
Know what I'm saying?
You want that over there?

I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

[Vince Staples:]
I was up late night balling
So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona I was round that corner
Still down I'm a norf norf soldier
G slide right down sawyer
When we slide you won't see morning
Another story of a young black man
Tryna make it up out that jam god damn
Bag back let me make my bands got plans
If you hatin' don't shake my hand
Take it easy homie
Reminiscin' sitting in that Benz
Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the 22, 5 shot eyes on scan
For the click clack clap
Or the boop bop bam cuz

[Juicy J:]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

[Vince Staples:]
It's funny I was going crazy not too long ago
Women problems every morning like the Maury show
Swimming upstream while I'm tryna keep my bread
From the sharks make me wanna put the hammer to my head
At the park politickin' with the kids
Tryna get em on a straight path, got the lames mad
Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation conversations what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss
Wanna be the boss then you gotta pay the cost
Learned it from the Dogg I'm from Long Beach
That's the city where the skinny carry strong heat

[Juicy J:]
I was up late night ballin'
Countin' up hundreds by the thousands

[Vince Staples:]
Crabs in a bucket

Crabs in a bucket
Wanna see what the bottom, don'tcha love it?
When they're hatin' so you hit 'em with the encores
Sendin' shots but you at the top floor
Let 'em pop shit, give 'em some drugs to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious
If not that then [?] turned artist
Get with that or get in the moshpit
Where's your moxie, in truth from Poppy
Young man, you not actin' too cocky
Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Run a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
Them feelin' funny, guarantee gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put him in the bag
Prolly gonna regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They donât never want to see the black man eat
Nails in a black man's hands and feet
Put 'em on a cross or you put 'em on a chain
Lines be the same, he don't look like me
Rollcage on the GT3
Had a show on stage like a DVD
Put me in the MoMA when it's over with
I used to look up to the sky, now I'm over shit

[Kilo Kish:]
Remember that I still got you
I still got you here
I swear that they come and got you
Hidden in my head
Tryna vanish
I forgot to care
And you can try [?] baby
Now it's under there
Never even crossed my mind to think
Maybe you'd have flashed a glance at me
I never really crossed your mind
I never really crossed your mind
I never really had no chance to breathe


No stupid
Don't think too much, you gon' lose it
Just lose yourself in the music
Get off your ass and move that thang, girl
All my girls are my main girl
'Round the world in them planes
'Til they chains too strap to do range
'Til they see how you walk and your strange look

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

Oh my God, I'm the bigshot now
Prima Donna had them like "wow!"
Hitchcock in my modern day
Where the fuck is my VMA?
Where the fuck is my Grammy?
Supermodels wearin' no panties
Supercar, not drivin' no Camry
Freshman [?] but no rallies

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

My girlfriend looks like she's from Gilmore
Dance on my dick like we from Fillmore
This my ghetto story, crescendo
Coupe with them same windows, limos
Wrong label had me in limbo
Too much info, we're rich and prismo
Prolly loco, black as the Congo
Pay me pronto, wearin' snow camo

I'm on a new level
I am too cultured and too ghetto
If you knew better you'd do better
But then you would know by the word of my penis
Please do not treat me like I'm not a genius
I'm runnin' on empty, the new River Phoenix
I'm out in Bristol, bro from the ends got a pistol
The bro from the ends gonna get you

These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back

[Kilo Kish:]
I was 'pose to meet you
Don't tell my girls or I'll creep through
I never see you
Can't figure what I did to leave you
Everything's see-through
Your official smile to see you
They can see you
Wish that I could see too


[Damon Albarn:]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be disheartening, darling
Love can be

[Kilo Kish:]
Love can be a loss or maybe not
You can give me all the cash you got
Slap me, take the keys, go round the block
Make some memories and die [?]
I'm over you
You talk a lot of shit, unamused
Ain't puttin' on the ritz
I could finish you like I fit in shoes
So you know my name
I'm not your babe
What's that you're saying?
I don't speak lame
You know my name
I'm not your babe
Thinking of coming?
Kindly refrain

[Vince Staples:]
Wannabes buzzing
Girls love the lifestyle
So prone to clubbing
Come alive when the night's out
Just crashed the sports car
So much for fast life
Phone calls from loves lost
Tryna get back right

[Ray J:]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be so disheartening, darling
Love can be
Love can be, yeah
Love can be

[Vince Staples:]
Tell the world I want my OGs
Dodge the groupies, them don't move me
Uchies moved me somewhere cozy
Uchies never leave me lonely
Call my phone, say she horny, want me
I can make time or I can make money
I'ma keep countin', count me out, shawty
Never let a bitch Lil Bow Wow me
Never finna weaken, raise my seat
Baby mama drama on the TMZ
Alimony money for the nails and weave
Nail me to the cross like that boy JC
Chuckin' up the deuce like the boy Chris Breeze
But we don't Su Woo on the six-five street
Riding down the shoreline, tank on E
No shotgun seat, this dick ain't free

[Vince Staples (Damon Albarn):]
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be
Love can be (disheartening, darling)

Yeah I been fucked since my early days
I been stuck in my worldly ways
Propaganda, press pan the camera
Please don't look at me in my face
Everybody might see my pain
Off the rail, might off myself
Bored with life as I board this plane
Stewardess asked if I need help
Maybe baby, what's your last name
Hopefully it still ain't been changed
Somethin' 'bout ya make me not doubt ya
I wuss out as my brain scream louder
Askin' when I'm gon' blast myself
Couple problems my cash can't help
Human issues, too strong for tissues
Fuck bravado, won't mask my wealth

Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

Deja vu from a bayside view
I see black cats in the daytime too
I see black cats on the daytime news
With handcuffed wrists and their skin turned blue
I made out once at the rendezvous and felt star-struck
"Vince, the car's out front"
Got things to do, got to make my moves
I can't miss my flight and miss you too, boo
First class seats is overrated
Won't go 'less they overpay us
Nowadays I'm overdatin'
My dick is strict for procreation
Her lips, my lips stay well acquainted
Her morning moans is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Move your body if you came here to party
If not then pardon me
How I'm supposed to have a good time
When death and destruction's all I see?
Out of sight, I'm out of my mind
The sound of sunshine is callin' me
Good vibrations is all I need
All I need, all I need

Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, yeah
Party people I like to see you dance
Party people, move
Party people I like to see you groove
This is how we do, this is how we do

I'm the man, ten toes in the street
I'm the blood on the leaves, I'm the nose in the Sphinx
Where I'm from we don't go to police
Where I'm from we don't run, we just roll with the heat
I'm the back of the bus, take a seat
Take a ride on the side where we die in the street
And the cops don't come for some weeks
No, the cops don't come for some weeks
Ride in the drop top, so I think
Might get JFK'd up, if not I prayeth
I\If so, no thang to a G
I feel just like Snoop on Andre day off
I run North Side of the beach
Run these streets like Ali Bomaye
I'm Louisville Brown on the beat
Best bet, try not to compete

Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need the fire
On prison time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Cover Girl, but her chest flat
Toothpaste spread in the CLR
Or, I think it was for Wayne
Can't remember springing for it, bring it on the plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Call Ca-lal-lane
She getting naked undercover's for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain, in the club
Don't you dream on how it feel to be in love?
What you drunk? You need a bus?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound

Rain come down
(And the rain)
Rain come down
Get your main laid down
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Rain come down)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Rain come down)


New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
New York, New York
Bright lights in dark skies
If I die today
Would you even know I existed?
Would you see my face?
How I love you so
You are so far away
You're in my skin, above my brain
If I should pass away
Gunshot


Way up, way up
Way up, way up

SAMO thing
Watch me do the same old thing
If I wrote your ass a love song, could I make it bang?
If I pull up with my guns drawn, run, I make it bang
Homie, tell me where you come from, tell me what you bang
Ain't a damn thing funny, but we laughin' to the bank
Never blow it on chains, rather blow my fuckin' brain
Decorator came from Spain, blow the budget on an accent couch
What that accent 'bout? Southern California livin'
Daddy in and out of prison, ain't no father to my style
I'm the ODB of the OPB
When I go OT, all the shows sold out
And the hoes show out, tryna be a baby mama
Tryna break a player pockets, that's a no no
This day forward, I ain't takin' photos
Then we wear our old clothes, we ain't givin' promo no mo'

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Win the race or fix your face, your woman on my dinner plate
I'm comin' for that last supper, center seat, I've been a G
I traffic 'cross the interstate
We cracked and launched the murder rate
They know who did the killin', but they didn't see
Want a verse? This the price. Want a show? This the fee
We don't do no bargain shoppin', we don't show no empathy
Empty out your pockets, $10,000 fee for that talkin'
I gotta take this extra five
No doubt in mind, we the best alive
No testifyin', we silent
Never told on my partners
My partner and 'em got bodies
I'm tryna put 'em in robbers
They used to put us in G rides, so now I put 'em in college
Put 'em on with this business then put 'em on with your mama

Just the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing
Do the same old thing, do the same old thing (way up, way up)
Watch me do the same old thing, just the same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Same old
Same thing (way up, way up, way up, way up)
Chain, big chain, ain't shit changed, same old thing

Way up, way up
Way up, way up

Is your house big? Is your car nice?
Is your girl fine? Fuck her all night
Is you well paid? Are your shows packed?
If your song played, would they know that?
How the thug life? How the love life?
How the workload? Is your buzz right?
Do the trap jump? Is the club right?
Got your head right? Boy, yeah right

Pretty women wanna slit the wrist
Pretty women wanna be a rich man's bitch
Pretty women want a couple kids
Pretty women want a new ass, new lips
Pretty women wanna push a Benz
Come correct and she won't let you in
Thumbin' through the checks, she gets it in
Diamonds on your neck, is them pretend?

Got an enemy that changes dependin' what direction
You're facin'
Got an enemy that tells you off, blockin' what's efficient
You're placed in
You pretend to get a better idea about the lifestyle
You're chasin'
Keep pretendin' that you real
Until every selfie is erased

Pop 'til it's fakin'
Pop 'til the wrist pop
Pop 'til he shakin'
Pop like four on the floor been in rotation
No allegation
Popular demand, I understand my name is only for conversation
New York nigga be like "deadass"
L.A. nigga be like "on the dead homies"
I was off the porch like Fed-Ex
211, got bread on me
K-Dot twilight the zeitgeist
Roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp
Temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
Just canary yellow gem, jumping out the fuckin' gym
Swang like new Dana Dane, I ride dirty
Paid like two Damon Wayans, retire early
Fade like shadows, corrallin' the cattle
A bitches decision for you, is narrow
Collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
The physic, the chemist, the lame
Collateral for Kendrick whenever exchange
Compatible for riches with more to gain
A sad nigga? Yeah right
I don't fair fight but I bear fight
Lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
Hangin' though my last four kills for the highlights
My life, high life, high five, bye, bye

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right
(Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right)
Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

Boy yeah right, yeah right, yeah right

I done beat the breaks off niggas
Shot the face off niggas
Pending case with state, and I'm still out trippin'
All the feds take pictures, fuckin' up my image
Even mama bringin' drama, i don't trust no BITCHES
See these hoes be out here switching their sides
When its time for the killin i ride
Look right in my eyes, been ready to die, risk felony time for threatening mine
Better than I, nobody alive
Nobody live the life that i did
Fighting to live since I was kid
Playing in the yard with a 30-06
House look like a gun range
Room look like a gun store
Either you're gonna know my name, or niggas dying young and poor
Either way don't give a fuck, you gon find me northbound
With the shit, I'm in the shit
You know I love them gun sounds
7's cry, macs applaud
They taking shots, I had to call
You catch em out the shot gun, that's Roddy White from 50 yards
No body shots, I'm hitting jaws
Tryna run you Stephen Hawking
You see I mean this shit I'm talking
You don't want no problem

[Hook:]
Slave to the rhythm, shoot my master in his back
2 dope boys, in the Cadillac strapped
Wood grain dash, windshield stained glass
Beating' down the ave, like we back selling' crack
Killing for the karma, but liven for my mama
Trouble what the call us, and nothing wit they offer
Off em, and they wonder why niggas get shot
And they wonder why niggas shot

Where you at, where you from?
Cause its hot where I'm at
Any time of the day you get robbed you get jumped
Itâs a game we play, to get paid
From the wants to the needs to the young
Snakes slide through the grass
Blades slide in the back, of the used and abused
Tryna walk in my shoes
Get tripped by my fuse, too short
Ask God what you want, he said I want your life
Well I ain't live mine right
But if I do the crime I do the time
I ain't scared of shit, I was born to die
Extended clip, big .45 been quick to trip
Been lost my mind
When I die, please don't let mama cry
Cause she know it had to be him or I
And I got caught slippin'
Get a gun and go knock that nigga
Run up on him, no mask, no feelings, no room for that
They shoot at us, so we shootin' back
Burnin' shells till I burn in hell
And I'm cool with that, that uzi packed
I done learned a lot in these 19 years
Lot homies ain't shed one tear
God decide what my curfew is
So till that day, I'mma do my shit
I proved my shit, they know my name
Not proud of the outcome either have regrets or
Be out young, don't sleep

[Hook]

[ScHoolboy Q:]
I took the blue pill and it's evidence was shown
Homies from elementary some them niggas gone
I got this cocaine
But my stove ain't turning on
I got that knock-knock
Uuh, yeah you know
Riding in the whip for sure
No Ls in the whip for sure
All the homies strapped but it ain't for show
Tryna hit a lick, no envelope
Nigga, weed ain't the only thing get smoked
Cuz got ghost 'fore he even got ghost
Cuz got toast and he ain't old enough to drink
Shouldn't been singing
Now his ass Murder Inc
Sunny LA, where we never need a mink
Sunny LA, where the youngers don't think
Sunny LA, where the heat get sprayed
And every other word on the wall get K'ed
All the homies taking you to parking space
This my set, I ain't hearing whatcha say
Back then had to be in by 10
But out by 12
My man just said the word
I got the text on the cell
Back with the Locs raising Hell
Found out the homie in a cell
I know we hated school
But it's better than jail
Gotta thank God I was saved by the bell
Tryna spit bars
I ain't trying to live behind 'em
So I keep my face here
Right where I found them
Nigga my rawness
Fuck through a condom
Ready when I'm rapping
No wonder why they signed him
I'm with the house
So watcha still pining
Dead by the street lights
Boy you shining
Talk about you grinding


Understand me nigga, Donât need no Grammys
Give us the money you got in your pockets, I feel like taxing nigga
Bout the action, give me a reason, Iâll gladly get it knockinâ
Chunky nine right by my side look like a midget walkinâ
Watch the shit that you talkinâ, promise its with me often
I got to stop with the trigger talkinâ, I promised mama
But Iâm rapping my life, I load automatics at night
Ops donât come to the Pop, they know they gettinâ dropped
I getting on âcause I be getting off, in my lane
You gettingâ no luck, get a job
I should throw my shows at synagogues
Mention me when you mention God
But fuck it, Iâm just talkinâ shit to yâall

[Hook - Joey Fatts:]
Young and gunninâ, niggas stay drumminâ
Big tools in your house, say we here for the plumbing
Niggas say they with it, but them boys frontin'
Choppinâ shots with your block, fuck niggas say somethinâ
Fuck niggas say somethinâ, fuck niggas say somethinâ
Niggas stay drummin, choppinâ shots with your block
Fuck niggas say somethinâ

Chop a choppa down, they told me never run
Unless you hear them copper sounds, I got them copper rounds
Gunnin' for them gold plaques
A 2014 Benz with the low jack, Pirellis's and the pistol stack
Riding down Obispo Ave, thinkin' bout the bus days
Never goin' back to that, checks be coming back-to-back
Put you on the front page, have the homeys handle that
Pro club hoodie, straps, socks with the sandals wrapped
Long beach legend, Jordan kick me out
If you from the city, that should tell you what I'm really bout
Give 'em class to get the cash, run your mouth, I'll kick your ass
But I'm just talkin' shit again

[Hook]


Guns and roses, another young boy lost, another fallen soldier
Younger brother tears falling on his mother shoulder
She got some tears of her own, wished she had loved him stronger.
13 but he grown, you see the gun he holding
That was made for a man, the rush he get when he load it
Is one you wonât understand, unless you hold it and blow it
Granny moved from New Orleans searching for better life
Her troubled cardiac is all she got
Eating at McDonaldâs by the laundomat
Daughter was 17, she just want to know where the party at
Met somebody that night, fucked him, he never called her back
Now her oldest bastard son sitting in that casket young

Guns and roses, another young girl lost, you see her heart was broken
She used to love so strong, until she got done wrong
Ainât wanna feel no guilt, she blamed it all on home
But still it felt so real, and since she lied so well
Her parents never could tell where she was really at
Now is it really love, or is it just another lie to fuck inside his mama truck
Raw like the emotions of her crying that night
Her pillow soaked, she missed the hope she had as a kid
But he doing all the things that her dad never did
Heâll be the dad of the kid if she had it, but still he'd rather not
Steal her mother's car, hit the bar just to grab a shot
From the guns and roses
Living young and hopeless

Guns and roses, I had it all in my home but mother never noticed
The neighborhood where I roamed was known for countless encounters of people pressing they line
I try to stay in my boundary, when bountyâs placed on your head for shit you never had did
You just conform to survive, not trying sit in no pit, I like me better alive
357âs for 6, 11 fit in your 9
I take them both when I dip cause I ain't dying today
The shitâs a game that we play what you bang where you stay
Before you answer just spray, theyâll never see it coming
Hit a man, woman, child or dog cause itâs mine before yours, its 2 weapons of war

Its guns and roses
Young
Victim of the guns and roses


[Hardo:]
Fuck these bitches, I'm focused on business
Got 'em running in the hood like I bought a new engine
What these niggas try to save I'll spend in a minute
All this money in the way, niggas ain't in my vision
I was really on that block, I came up from nothin'
Putting everything in it, it was all or nothin'
Now these diamonds on my neck got all these bitches fuckin'
With a kid, they used to sin, now I'm the one who fronted
See this Rollie on my wrist, that thing glitter and gold
Eatin' off this old bread, all these niggas go mold
Middle fingers to the haters and niggas that told
Money over everything, that's the way that I roll

[Hook - Mac Miller x2:]
I must have died and went to heaven
Currently in shock, it'll hit me in a second
What's your question, you need a blessin'... right?
Or you're just wondering what heaven's like

[Mac Miller:]
I got bitches, all I see is bitches, all I see is bitches
Windows tinted
Hide some people in it
We extremely lifted
Ain't no limits
Kids defying physics
Crucifying bitches
Ain't your business how I spend my time, I got bigger fish to fry
They telling lies, I swear to God
Heaven left 'em mesmerized
Everything ain't televised
When it rain, then it shines
Nevermind. Missing all the devil's signs
Hellen Keller blind, you need eyes
Then I'mma come and lend you mine
Every time I start walking proud, they wanna chop chop chop chop me down
I just wanna make out with Foxy Brown
Monday nights, shit raw for now
Close it up, yeah I lock it down
Smoking blunts 'til I'm Gangnam Style
Coughin' into my coffin now
Have a bad bitch, money, and a crocodile
With me
Rest in peace to Pimp C
Set me free
Need ecstasy
I just really wanna get my jet to leave
Go and play the front 9 at Pebble Beach
Just set some goals that I'll never reach
Get you high, seven leaves, never peak
Good energy 'til it's rest in peace

[Hook x2]

Running out of hope, running wild cuz my momma close
To dying while we broke, a youngest child, I always listened to my father
When he spoke, because he'd been through it all
A Chris Paul jersey hung on the wall in ninth grade
Back when niggas only wanted to ball
We used to steal from the mall and had to run from the guards
But now we run from the law with guns stuffed in our drawers
And all my chambers revolve cuz I can't risk gettin' caught
I got too much on my plate, I think a better tomorrow is what I'm trying to make
At least for most where I stay, I learned at a young age ain't no savin' 'em all
See some problems is born too far gone to be solved
I got a lot on my heart. Scorn the weary
Never believin' no woman, cuz bitches lie on the frequent
Live and die by this gun, niggas ain't shooting for fun
So run your pockets, we need it

[Hook x2]


Live from Delusion
Die on the street or reside in the ruins
Running high from police, throw the nine in the sewer
25 is the least of the time that you're doing
Do or die, staying true to the lies on the stand
Right hand on the word of a god and forgive
All the wrongs that you did trying to live by your means
Breaking news 10 P.M. see your friends on the screen
And these bitches wanna talk about some mother fucking rap
Bullet holes in the home where my lil' brother at
Pigs parked on the streets so we can't shoot back
Spend a week where I sleep most can't do that
Might look half neat till the nightfall comes
First the good years screech then you hear that drum
Fuck 911 police don't come
Had Jabari on the streets till the sun came up
Momma son raised up in the midst of a feud
I'm from genocide where you die for your residence
Die for the presidents I chase
We reach the same fate so I never get to thrive in the relishment
Might seem jaded but even Satan was heaven sent
Coulda been a bum, broke sleeping by the 710
17, dropped out knew I had to make a way
Couldn't have my granny broke before she seen the pearly gates
Hope she ain't judge for me
Only person living never showed love to me
Dad did time cause he sold drugs for me
I could never judge a man trying to better off his fam
Shoot a fucker waist in
Gotta take you to your maker
Till I'm buried in the grass and the candle light the pavement
I'm gonna do it to the best of my abilities
The fear in me is gone, you can hear it in the song while you listening


[Ab-Soul:]
Black-lip bastard, destined to be a bastard Crip
But I passed on it to make classic hits
I pray I'm forgiven for not being down or
Putting the work in that certain niggas did, reason behind they service
In the pen partially why I don't write
I just pull it out the wind, sometime I can't sleep at night
I be thinking 'bout my friends, know they up to no good, it's all bad
I seen the yellow tape at Del's and almost had a heart attack
You never know with this shit, I don't understand
Kids carry cannons on Instagram, but crying when the cuffs on they hands
It's out my hands, it's two sides to every story
And I ain't a judge or signed up for jury duty
My youth was stolen moving too quick, it's sick, though
Cause Vince know what I know now when I'm 26
We still moving further, hope seeds grow to be
Trees and not just bushes hiding burners

[Hook:]
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Please
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without killing y'all?
Can I live without-

Call the gang unit, they know the name, foolie
I truly was built for the shit
I'm in the ring cooling right by where the enemies live
You know you can't kill a giant with a lucky shot
Aim for the head when you fuck with God Jehovah
I hopefully be speaking the colder the beat, snitching
We doming your niece, homies as cold as police
Momma had told us as kids never to shit where you eat
And got a clip for the heat, .357, I think I'm Itch Dawg
Niggas know I'm 65 'til I'm six feet
Under where they took us undercovers parked on Orizaba
Dogs up in the yard of the abandoned where we hide the choppers
I couldn't hide from the Karma, you see, it followed me
Fuck it! Get it cracking in public, these niggas rap for the fashion
They want the mansion, they puppets
A puppet master will bust and that chamber talk but I'm muzzled

[Hook]


I'm here to tell the world I'm from Ramona park
Diving in the deep water like I know the sharks
Climbing in the king daughter I deserved the crown
They weren't fucking with ya boy, but they heard me now
Me and white boy Mac came to take them back
Way back, back when people used to learn from rap
I'm here to show you motherfuckers what I learn from Pac, Slim
Couple rounds in the clip down for burning that
Beats i murder that, beef i murder that
Heard the shooter yell NNer before he heard the mac
And even if that nigga didn't
Bet he know it's them
Black with a little bit of brown like a doberman
That 1911 hold 11
Go and call the 9-11
He just send his soul to heaven
Bitches say the shows is heaven sitting in the front row
Turned a couple Poly High games to the gun show
Turned a couple Wilson High gangs to the track meet
You be in to rap beef cause you ain't never have beef
Joey thats my brother so I'm part of all of Fatts beef
And you know my strap
Keep talking thats my black bitch

2-2-3 make a fat nigga black flip
One 16 wipe niggas off the map quick
Never had to show a lot of effort with the rap shit
Going for the kill cause I never really had shit
Same old stereo type, got the stereo hype
Hope when I die that I'm buried like Mike
Guys on that prize that ain't even my sight
If you want that fire then he leaving tonight to show
Two claps when I see my yaNNcs
Two straps been moved that across the interstate
Arizona homies call me Flagstaff shortie
Chrome Kel Tec nine and a big black 40
We be shooting up the parties like we got no sense
Ride around city trippin, we ain't got no tints
Hood been my home, I ain't got no rent
We be chillin' on the pop like we livin' on the pop
Never slipping, not trying to see the prison like my pops
Never giving you a pass if I consider you a Op
Don't consider you a threat if you ain't sending niggas shots
Got some killas with me down to put a nigga in the dirt
Light the candles on the curb, send a message to the cops
Snitch niggas in the feds sending letters to the cops
So I never trust a soul, when they ask I'm never speaking
My Baretta Scott King strong and black and she could be
Team trying to gangrene like that old Max B
Old French Montana, macaroni with the cheese
Young Joe Montana throwing bullets through your defense
They need Vince, you should put him on your team
If I die on these streets then consider me a martyr
Enemies ghost 5 deep in the charger
Down to shoot though cause I got that jumper
Been on that block this my 19th summer
Momma playing Stevie Wonder in the kitchen while she cooking
Pigs knocking at the door to take my dad to central booking
Reading books up in my room cause she won't let me go and play
Scared her youngest son will run around and go pick up a K

Fuck that shit you represent I'm here to get these presidents
Wouldn't be the only king to come up where the peasants live
Pray to god I never do the shit that both my parents did
History repeats itself, it's up to me to change it
Watch me burn the book of life and write the pages in my favor
On some King James shit
Call me Mr. on some Rosewood Ving Rhames shit
Keep a pistol in the Gap fleece
We aim quick, leave a nigga on the backstreets
Same old shit, you heard Stuck In My Ways
No the show don't stop, I could do it for days
If you disrespect my family we all gon' fight
Swinging like T Woods, trying to earn my stripes
Yeah that uppercut will fuck him up so say goodnight


[Da$h:]
Catch me on a trunk night, throwin' up a dirt bike
English dikes on the back and they screamin', "Fuck life!"
To be honest, only fuck twice
My drug jacket got the thug stripes
I'm glad they hate me, they ain't love Christ or Mike Jordan either
Dip my blunts in ether, chase the last name of Aretha
When they hear me through the speakers man these niggas know I mean it
The mannerisms of a genius, models down to seen it
The flow is scenic
The ho is black, the car is European
Cream soda when we put the lean in
Fuck your team, your clique, whatever you bangin'
I come through blunt lit, bucket low, nuts hangin'
Like nigga what? Nigga yawk! Niggas know me
The fuckin' dollar, crossed to the dark side so it's fuck Obi Kenobi
You active, motherfucker then show me
I tell your fuckin' wife to blow me
Nigga, it's still fuck you (Still fuck you)

[Ab-Soul:]
Yo, still searchin' for Easter pink on Easter Sunday
Black lip pastor Herb done lit the herb and passed it your way
Master with the nouns and verbs, you haven't heard the wordplay?
I'm the most def here, shouts to black Dante
The stakes is high, who'd like to climb on my gate
Live from the last name of Kanye
I heard your whoop de whoop and blase blases
So when I cut you off consider Kendrick Lamar
You know it's all in the family tree
The helix of my DNA should read T-D-E, what can I say?
I left a acid tab for Da$h on his dashboard
I hope he don't crash tryin' to dash for it
Your bitch fuckin' like, like I paid cash for it
Motherfucker, Soul!

[Mac Miller:]
It's Young Fisherman sinkin' in Lake Michigan
Innocence, voice of an angel, so Minnie Riperton
Gettin' lit exquisite bitch, live from the Wimbledon
Still sinnin' as Bill Clinton, that's ill pimpin'
She butt-naked swimmin', I'm payin' her no attention
Workaholic, got a TV show, I know you seen the crib
Nasty since a youngin' it's unsanitary birth
Watch this beat get buried in a hearse, yeah I kill myself
Mac hippy analog, rap midi turn the cameras off
I made you snap, I'll slap your bandana off
Your bitch greet me like I'm Santa Clause
Mouth wide, I'm high as a satellite see
I'm in ancient Greece gettin' head from Aphrodite
Mac is mighty, got a bunch of whities actin' like me
I set the bar high
This a bizarre ride, word to Pharcyde
In plaid pants, hit a hole in one on the par 5
Eyes closed drinkin' whiskey, let the car drive
These hoes thirsty, see the dick and they large-eyed

Never gave a dollar to the pastor
Hoes can't get inside my home without the password
My past worth was measured by those who got less then now
Safe to say you motherfuckers know you like my style
Paved the way for they new found vision
Now they mad at a nigga, call me dad when you preachin' boy
Never one for trippin', find me full-speed sprintin'
While they yellin' coldchain
Please tell me what it is and what it ain't
Niggas sniffelin', catchin' feelings while I'm laughin' to the bank
Chasin' bitches that they'll probably never get, what a shame
Meanwhile I'll be sittin' in this critical acclaim
Walkin' drowsy off a plane, drinkin' water in the rain
With your daughter tryin' to garnish her brain for future reference
I'm some shit you'll never see in the game
And if I could I'd explain, but this right here's the end


I wanna ask God why the Bible lied to me
Just full of politics, leaving niggas without a sin
Is it false prophets who forged the religious documents
I done spent my whole life sinning without a consequence
Momma trying to figure what the fuck my problem is
And why I gotta live this way
I know my path ain't straight
But in the field, don't nothing but grit matter
Just get it how you live and figure the shit after
Nigga, gotta get it before I die out here
Don't wanna see my momma cry out tears
Sitting below the earth
Cause Heaven's out of the question
But for what it's worth, we made the most out of the nothing they give us
Heart was frigid but both these boulders sit on my shoulder
I try to figure my motive for leaving niggas behind
But if my fate is defied, hope whatever messiah that sent me there
Knew he only did this shit for survival
I'm so

[Hook:]
Stuck in my ways
The love and the hate
Was both shoved in my face
Gotta stay on your toes
Head starts in the race
Just wasn't given to those
Who came up where I stay
Ya name up in the game
But start watching ya back
These hoes want what you got
Trying to plot on your stacks
Still the plot thickens
Yeah, they better hope God with 'em

Is black pride still alive, or was niggas trippin?
Cause last time I checked, we lost self respect
And some didn't admit it cause momma was with the business
And daddy was trying to fuck
He left, that's just his luck
Suppressed, nothing but anger inside that chamber
Aim from the other side so we hate him
No need explaining
Baby momma drama cause karma being a hater
Now it's lookin' like abortion, your momma doing the favor
Black Buick Le Sabre, creeping down the street
No tags on the whip so you sneakin' past police
25, two strikes, you don't need a number three
They pull you over, now you nervous cause the heater by the seat
So...

[Hook]


I just want to get my bread
And talk my shit before I end up dead
I got all this blood sitting on my hands
I never gave no fucks so they understand why I feel this way
Just found God and I still don't pray
Cause Satan preys on the weak swear I can do it myself
Soul stuck in the beats it's like I'm crying for help
Still my expression is bleak because my momma ain't raised no bitch
Never take no shit from no nigga unless he want to see the black four fifth
From the ghetto where the oceans is, but all hope is lost
We know the laws and quick to break 'em once there's dough involved
Young age they wrote us off, guns blaze they go to court
I got a lot of homies gone product of they're broken home
But who's to say what's right and wrong, they ain't live it
Looking straight into their eyes still and they ain't get it

[Hook:]
But if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I've ever had
I'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past
They say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh
We gave all that we had and got nothing

As far as music kid I'm innovative
Niggas pretend to hate it, influence you niggas favourite
You stupid believe in different, authentic you lack the stitching
Sitting when it's game time, snitching when you face time
What's wrong with you niggas?
See I was brought up where that talking gets you shot up at apartments
Where the bitch that set you up had told you meet her just that morning
Just a warning, my performance astounding
Everybody want something, get these niggas from 'round me
Tryna climb skyscrapers
Life is but a dream but is never what it seems
So I never leave my weapon at the house
Rather spend time sitting behind bars than in a grave
I'm getting paid trying to change from my sinning ways

[Hook]

Working on my thousandth time telling you sorry
Walking around pretending it ain't affect me
But nothing was further from the truth
Least I'm trying to re-coop
Just blame it on the youth
No matter what you feel or seen I was in it too
Probably more than you would ever believe
You gave me something I would never receive again
We probably won't be again
But, would you expect it though?
I'm just the nigga, that I promised you I was
When you swore that I was better
Was in it through the weather storm
Just was better moving on
There was a time I thought that I would never think about you again
You was the best friend a nigga could have
I used to call you when I thought that I would die that day
And you would calm me down and I would make my way
You probably should have stayed
It just wasn't your place

I thought about you today


We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

I rap because I'm bored, and I'm bored because I hate everything
That I see day after day, out in L.A, I just stay
Because I'm scared that my life will be real once I leave
I hope God's gotta trick up his sleeve, just for me
If he there, or care about a nigga like that
Told the voices stuck in my head that I'll be right back
Can't get sidetracked, too much to lose
It's 1000 ways to die, way too many to choose from
The hardest part is wishin' for escape when you can't run
I'm unstable, not ready for when my fame come
So I prepare for the worst, I know them faggs will say
He snapped, but he snapped soon as his grandmother passed away

We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous

But at the end of the night, I don't know you niggas
So I feel as if It's nothin' that I owe you niggas
That 4 pound Goku's niggas, leaves holes big as whole foods produce section
But if I empty a clip
I'll still be empty as shit
Fuck all that sympathy shit
Find where my empathy went
Just wish you would leave me alone
Then I start righting my wrongs
Probably stop writing these songs
Now all this pressure is on
Standing in the midst of the fire
Just turn my back on the world
Cus everybody's a liar
Guess its time for me to find my messiah
All my scriptures come as bullets
And the bible's in the form of a rifle
Just take one to the head
I don't gotta recite

We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous


[Vince Staples:]
They all tell me I suck like Kurt Angle
Riot 'til that gun come out the hump
If you was smart you would duck
Duck goose with a slut, it's still two in the back
Still one in the front
My last gun in a month was a Remington Revolver
Fucking bummer how I didn't get to use it when I caught her
But anyway, I pulled the David Bowie out to skin her scalp
The sassy slut, just left half
And that's a motherfucking Cassie Cut

[Michael Uzowuru:]
That's all you get hahaha
That's all you fucking get


Champagne Wishlist, Bad Hoes
Smear that slipstick, Black Porsche
Gt with stick shift
Seat heaters, came with' bisquick
Break fast, stop a niggas lifeline
Speed off, leave him dead at the red-light
Tell them bitch ass niggas, get they bread right
Or get they lead right
Load up we out here erry night

Let me take you niggas back in the day
When some niggas from my city claim east side pain
It was like '08, sidekick '08s
That we here for
Filithyz made racks off robbery
Ain't a nigga livin' stoppin' me
Unless he poppin' me
Momma said I lost the God in me, My apology,
Live for takin' niggas property
Gangsta' hawk in me
Asking if the coppers follow me, Nigga probably
But I ain't never been scared of a lil' swine
Down to do a lil' time
Gimme space to clear my mind
Countin' up the sins of mine
Ran outta hands and feet
Holla' at me if you need the hands, I'll supply your need
I need the cheese, like a dope man needs the fiend
I don't believe anything' a nigga ever see
The only thing that scaring me, is a better me
So testin' me, you'll put your life in jeopardy

Champagne Wishlist, Bad Hoes
Smear that slipstick, Black Porsche
Gt with stick shift
Seat heaters, came with' bisquick
Break fast, stop a niggas lifeline
Speed off, leave him dead at the red-light
Tell them bitch ass niggas, get they bread right
Or get they lead right
Load up we out here erry night

I introduce to you America's disaster
Known as young black man with'out a master
Ain't signin' shit unless you givin niggas masters
The old men in space that I roam ima blast em
So try to play me and you kno' what's coming after
A hit em with them yam, like lebron on the gather
Never been a pacifist
Blame it on my pastor
When they tried to gimme ass to kiss
I gave them automatics
Makin' matters worse, every time I patch a verse
Blame the FBI for the unsuspected death of mine
Columbine, when it's chopper time
Chopper, chop her down, chopper style
Still a juvenile, but I'm runnin' wild


I remember when I first saw "Fade to Black"
I told my grandma I'd get a chain just like that
She asked me was I trying to rap, not fucking with that
Just trying trap bricks, and stack chips
Cus that gold look good with a 'Lac tint
In the front seat sitting with a Mac-10
Just skating, Rory Fitzpatrick
Dope mathematics is all a nigga know
In it for the show, yeah the money and the hoes
All I ever want
Posted in the hood, shit I probably never go
Nigga run his mouth, then we throw him in the trunk
Bet his Mama never see him again, cus we in this to win
Not repented for sin, just replenish you ends
When it's time to fuck with Heaven, I'll just pay to get in
Spend the rest on a Benz, 5% on the tints

If I had all the money in the world, the money in the world
The clothes, the cars, the girls

Maserati Ricky, East side king with a semi
Pinstripe Dell Curry jersey's lighting 30's
Block hot so we stocking chickens in the churches
Sell em after service, bitch I service the community wales
Old dude said I'm going to hell, nah I'm going to well
Turn the castle into a crack house
Bitches with they back's out, trying bring they ass out
Hoping that the seed sprout, soon we'll check
See that fast life's cool till it all boils over
Bulletproof Rovers and two-faced chauffeurs
Won't save shit from a loud gun rip
When friends turn to foes on some come up shit
Most niggas die tryna live that life
But you never get to live that twice
So cock that, right?

If I had all the money in the world, the money in the world
The clothes, the cars, the girls


[Vince Staples:]
Doctors getting nervous
They running out of prescriptions
Mentally demented emotions are non-existent
Mother contemplating if this could've been prevented
Feeling like the blame for a child turnin' sadistic
Well, really?
You can blame it all on the Ridolin and Zoloft
That had me seeing Satan in my playpen
Family, I hate them
They prayers never did shit
Fuck is God supposed to understand
The pain he never had to deal with
Hell: he never been there
But forced me to live in
Don't ask me why I'm sinning
Cus I feel that nigga owe me one to tell the truth
Either be the victim or the first to shoot
Grab the Ruger and a clip or two
I want this ballad to be played at my funeral service
For a child, 17, whose brutally murdered
By himself, tortured for years
The one voice nobody ever wanted to hear
So, the ones inside of his head had to take control
God wouldn't take my soul, if that shit was free of charge
Satan neither, I need a breather from all this breathing
Grab a trigger and squeeze it
Martin Ruger King

[Vince Staples:]
Mr. International, I can probably times two
Everything you do in life and everything you might do
Probably stick my dick up in the bitch you say goodnight to
Niggas swear they beasting, I don't know who hyped you
Motherfucking lames, If I could I probably fight ya
Have my people light ya, you know just what them brothers do
Magic in the 32, LA Lakers run and shoot
Hit your mother, father, sister, daughter, and your cousin too
I'm the shit, hope you know, waving like row your boat
Sitting like southern poles drop the "e" add a "o"
That be my wardrobe, you malling with your mom
Rushing right before the store close, stack up a head case
Rare like a red steak, 90th and Hooper
Just to get the record set straight, homie we just set dates
Because I'mma get to popping once the L-beast start the drop
And you niggas start to flop and then you bitches get to copping

[LaVish:]
Uh, I'm in the carpool doing 150
With a dime piece out having lunch with me
My lifestyle now, boy it's something trippy
Rather hit the blunt 'cause I'm never getting tipsy
Yeah puffing on the green like an urban hippy
They repeat my name now like Timmy, Timmy
Timmy Timmy, T-Timmy Timmy, T-Timmy Timmy
Flying out boy genius, call me Jimmy
The first thing they speak about in any conversation
I'm going for the win, you're just the nomination
LaVish what they call me, and I'm often hated
I ain't the best yet, won't stop until the greatest
Yeah my bud is shining like a flashlight
And yeah we can collab for a flat price
And I'm rolling in a Polo, Marco
I bet they won't forget me, like Sarah Marshall
Dodger fitted on on the Ralph bucket
You a extra in this movie, yeah I'm out stunting
If you ain't talking money, then you ain't saying nothing
L-A-V signing out
I'm Chris Brown, run it


Welcome to the Compton Zoo, ridin' on a chocolate moose
Camoflage Hummer gang, interior by Dr. Seuss
Gold dust, gold chain you knew I had to rock the noose
Just a nigga anyway, Emmett Till semi spray
But I pack a right hook only Robin Givens knew
Knock him out, paramedics had to use the Pikachu
Who invited sharks to the neighborhood swimming pool?
Sellin' streebo out of Deebo's pigeon coup-
Deville, "Ooh he I'll" is what the bitches say
That'll put your dick away, bullets tend to ricochet
Padlocks say Shawn Kemp had a flat top
Trynna sell this Richard Pryor autographed magic box
I might trade for a harpoon or a sasquatch
A two-tone do-rag or a Matlock DVD, flip hoes no TLC
Sell PCP to minors
Sherm by the boatload, perm from the soul glow
Closest that I ever been to church was the pollo
"No one ou there can fuck with me" Prodigy

I wrote this verse on my way to church
Rifle and the autographed Bible in the backseat
Life is like a track meet: When you hear them shots better run nigga
Cause I got that motherfucking gun nigga
Drug-dealer, crime rates run in the family
Juvenile felon so I'll never go the Grammy's
Who cares? Rather drive drunk bumpin' some Brandy
Going hard in the paint like I'm Olowokandi
Say, "Hi" to the big black forty when it click-clack
Push a nigga's wig back, pray for his family
Catch his mom slippin' turn him to Bambi
Prolly slam it like Camby, cocaine flow
Hoes propane blow, Peggy Hill
All my weapons kill come and test it nigga

By the way, mixtape December 30th... you're welcome

I'm that shit Frankie Lymon was stuffing up his arms
Firearms snuck in the luggage just for the fuck of it
I'm who would be runnin' shit if Jason took a day off
Cruisin' with that Tommy Gun, rip a nigga's face off
Vanilla Sky, got 'em high, Glock named Paula
Sit inside of my tinted ride I squeeze it she be moanin'
Kelly Slater trynna rock the top, sharks start swarmin'
Now you stuck in deep water with a smooth barracuda
Custom Bape, German Lugers levitate, meet your maker
Masturbate, let 'em mace ya
Bitch so she can grade in greatness, Sick cum
Guard-dog swag, but never bit none
Your bitch cunt, ask her where she got that shit from


I still remember when I saw ya
5 foot 5, maybe a little taller
Smile that reminds me of Christmas morning
When you first woke up and them gifts was opened
Yes sir, baby girl I'll
Got me feeling unreal like I popped that pill
Neo-Nazi, killer body
I think I love ya, prolly
But I don't even know ya
I tapped you on your shoulder, asked your name
You gladly told me, then you asked the same
I told you I was Vince
And you said you heard about me well I hope you didn't listen
Thought that I should mention, that you my perfect vision
Remind me of the middle school days when I couldn't wait to get to class
Just so I could fall asleep and dream about your pretty ass
So baby we can go far, but its up to you...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Yeah... look... first name crystal, last name amazing
Stars in my mind really got my heart racing
They say I shouldn't rush, that I should pace the situation
But these feelings in my head has got me feeling impatient
You could say this love thing has got my heart aching
Even if it's waiting, when she say that she is taken
All options open, so I keep my doors vacant
I know that she baking, off this shit I'm making
Thinking that it break in, hoping that it break out
Lights all on, you taking pictures with your face out
Full on platters where waiters bring the steaks out
But how can I leave, when there's no one else to take out
And I know it ain't my business...
But I just thought that I should mention...
That you know what I'm missing, so don't sit there
And try to act like you don't feel this...

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay, the night with me?
And girl it's up to you...

Come summer time we was just relaxing
Swear that she was bad like the youngest of the Jackson's
The perfect imperfections, the first of my selection
Baby got drive, never asking for directions
She know she ain't my only, but she know just where the rest is
Young but never restless, she was losing lighter sleep
Cause she know when its said and done she gon' be right with me
Bonnie Clyde type shit, nice thighs, nice hips
Mind right, my type, my love, my life
My girl, my wife, couldn't say it better
Story board love, tell me who can play it better?
Shit gets stormy, we'll escape the weather
Her umbrella's up when them time's looking tough
Prolly wish we stop, but I can't get enough
So baby we can make this a forever thing
I'm talking 'bout, house, kids, cars, and wedding rings

I see your pretty face, and I try to approach her
I know that we just met, but can we get closer?
What can I say, to make you stay the night with me?
Well girl it's up to you...


Illuminati watchin us, police poppin us
Waitin' until Christ come back so he can walk with us
Shells in the revolver, best hit somebodys mama up
Kev-lars over the heart to match the scarring of
Our pops not bein' here, took him for a couple years
Now my niggas stuck in here, so what we love it here
The drugs is here, the guns is here
Our mothers here, we run it here
The police lookin for me, they gotta come in here
A vicious cycle controlled, the pigs runnin the show
You think these guns just get dropped off at the door?
But I'mma still shoot, cause these days if you ain't gonna spray then
Somebody gonna kill you

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone

My grandmother said we outta asthma medication
But get ready for school, still, cause hell is waitin
If you don't learn shit, you won't be shit
And that would probably mean shit
If they tried and teach kids during the class
Gotta a heart made of gold, knuckles smothered in brass
The snakes lay where you play, so I stray from the grass
Mind already troubled enough
So don't confuse my cruel actions for givin' a fuck
I show no love, parents didn't give me enough
Its too late now, I barely even like bein' touched
My girl stopped givin' me hugs, says I don't see her that much
But I just prefer bein' alone, because...

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone

Live for today cause tomorow never comes
Till I'm sittin' in the grave, I'll be sittin' in the slums
Cause I'm livin' just to die, ain't a ribbon in the sky
Just a nigga in the hood, buying time before it's gone


Alright, alright, alright

Man I love my bitches
Man they photogenic
Snatched em straight up out they Richardson mag they do my dishes
Man I love this Cripping
Man my homies with it
All these murders they ain't got enough ambulances with 'em
I ain't paying homage to nobody with no bodies
I don't care bout yo Ferrari I'll snatch you out that Bentley
Was cramming into Civics 'round 2010ish
Piled in the studio when not a nigga would listen

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Player shit player made
I'm stuck in my player ways
I just made a play today
She gave me some play today
My Jordan was lawaway
I caught me a fade a day
Around where Janaya stay
My 40 go dumb in a major way
I come from the game where they pay to play
These rappers extorted like everyday
That Yankee I'm sporting like every day
Just played me a show they paid 80k
I put it away for a rainy day
You never know when you gon catch a case
You never know when you gon catch an opp
We kill ever day like where Sosa stay
You might get a pass

Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Now we're big time, big time, big time
Hands up baby don't you see this big nine
Screamin' fuck the world like that shit mine

Big timer like Manny and Baby
Don't play with that man cause he crazy
With Demon and Ocho from Bompton
They stomping out niggas like Stacy
The radio never gon play me quit if my label don't pay me
I'll run up in there with my gun in the air screaming give me the shit you owe Jay Z
Bandana like Jayo from Daygo's
My temper depend how my day go
My girl do whatever I say so
She ain't got no reason to say no
I ain't wish for nothing but hood rich
You ain't seen how grimey my hood get
I been on some up to no good shit
You on that Cuba in Boyz N da Hood shit
I go down to Cuba and find me a plug
Sick of these rappers not selling no drugs
Sick of this industry playing these games
Sick of my enemies saying my name
Harder than niggas since Hollister nigga
I'll body a nigga for saying I can't
You should have known I go hard in the paint
You should have known ain't no stopping my wave

Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time
Big time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Next time on Poppy street
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?


This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it


[Vince Staples:]
I load the 44
Then paint the Van Gogh
She rang the front door
She came commando
She came and rambled
I came and rolled over
No time for conversations cold shoulders
Outta my mind
She outta red wine
She woozy bitch bourgeois straight from Dubai
She love the hip hop and love my slick talk
Give head then begged the boy to crip walk
I write the James Joyce
Don't need the Rolls Royce
I need a straight jacket finna go bat shit
Sick of these rapper stealing my swagger
Tryna run with the penmanship practiced
Gangsta gone Gatsby
Fades with no lotion
Get this shit cracking
Crack his jaw open
Crack in my system
Daddy loved smoking
Like he loved smoking niggas no joking

[Vince Staples & Kilo Kish:]
Everybody get a little bit crazy
Seems like you've been feeling that lately
Everybody gets a little bit lonely
Keep breathing slowly slowly
Right place at the wrong time
Wrong turn in my own mind
Right place at the wrong time
Got lost in my own mind

[Kilo Kish:]
It's okay, hey Vince, it's me
Things are going pretty great and this ain't what you need
Don't need to waste your time on an ignorant fuck
Send me some more money, we'll laugh it all up
Hey, remember how we used to fight in Pre-K?
Mama whooped that ass for 3 days
Parties at McDonald's for our birthday
It's okay, it's okay, guess I should say

[Vince Staples:]
Lemme tell ya 'bout, when a nigga went crazy
At the Marriott, having Kurt Cobain dreams
Lemme tell ya bout, when a nigga went loco
Ace hotel shoulda stayed at the Soho
Housekeeping keep knocking on my door though
Don't she know I'm staring in the mirror with a 44
Tryna get my head straight
She tryna get the bed straight
No room to think
KABOOM on the sink

Uhh me tienes harta
(Pinche baboso abre los ojos)
Quien te cres eh? El muy chingon?
(Date cuenta de lo que tienes)
Tu no eres nadien
(Ya no eres niÃ±o)
Todo lo que quieres hacer te sale mal, eres un estupido no sabes nada
(You're a grown ass mutherfuckin' man)
Nadie te toma enserio
(I fuckin' hate you, just leave me the fuck alone)
Sabes que, vete a la chingada me caes gordo
(Pinche puto desgraciado)
Pinche vato pendejo
(I fuckin' hate you)

[Kilo Kish:]
Everybody get a little bit crazy

[Vince Staples:]
In the black Benz speeding with my black skin gleaming
Out the window
Tints low baby come and see 'em where the rent low
Been gone I don't need a shrink I need a hit song tryna show the world a nigga
Tweaking
Been a schizo crip though off of 65th though
Anybody killer I ain't aiming when the shit blow
Jumping through your window finna hit a lick mode
Thugging since the flip phone don't be who I flip on

We all waste away, what are you looking for?
We all waste away, what do you got in store?
We all waste away, cause I can't take much more
We all waste away, rather be lost and poor
What my pastor say? Some shit that I don't believe
What my master say? Nigga, you won't be free
Until you pass away, razor on my sleeve
Tryna compensate, this pain, it run so deep
"But you a star," they say, "You mean so much to me
Mean so much to me"


What you thought it was nigga I'm the man round here
Hands down man down by my grandma crib
On the east
Riding round don't be slipping
Don't Blood me cause whole Long Beach Cripping
No cease
Firing I'm fired up tripping
In A NY fleece wasn't playing no Biggie
WCand Trey D keep shit crippy
No boot camp clicking we was food stamp flipping
Tryna eat
1st of the month re'd up 15th
Quarter punch ice cream trucks police
Stay tryna lock niggas up
Foes wacking out the set then we shot niggas up
No peace
No love not not clicking up
Swapmeet whites and a Glock in the trunk
OG's tryna tell a nigga bout the game
But it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same on me

Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, it don't add up cause the Crippin' not the same
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong

Well I was born by the river not baptized in it
Loose lips sink ships who capsize quicker
Not we
Stay low-key no snitching
Since soul glo dripping and the sherm stick dipping
Tread light
Snakes gone bite on sight
Niggas battle with the judge like the gavel got a grudge
Face life
Still fight never been a punk
Chase dough hoe never get enough lemme tell you bout the flocks
Looking for the tents mama gotta pay the rent
Kicking in the back door tell me where it is
Come up out the safe or its coming out the clip
And I don't hesitate washing money like the sins
Attention getters hit detention centers
Before I break the bank, boy ill break and enter
Both ears to the streets listen in a drought
Cause when money coming niggas get to showing out

When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
When money comin' in, niggas get to showin' out
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong, pimp hand strong
Yeah, time to show the bitches who the man
Pimp hand strong


[Vince Staples:]
Kick cack ce cool, watch a nigga get it
I be all around the city with the semi naughty crippin'
All the homies say I'm different, police say I raise suspicion
Buy a million dollar home and blow my dome to paint the kitchen
Bitches like, "Is that Venetian?"
Niggas salty when they meet him
Cause they never finna beat him
And they'll never get a feature
I'm a star, tell Billy I'm a bill him for the sneakers
You conversin' with a nigga, better be about the green
I've been broke, I ain't goin' back
Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back
Call me King Latifah
If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper
Better keep her in the house
Watch your mouth
Don't be screamin' from the bleachers, nigga

Is it real?
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real?
Real, real
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real, real? Is it it real?
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant
Once you get addicted to it
Is it real?

I just wanna be DaVinci baby
Why they wanna kill me baby?
Feelin' like a pop star, music drive a nigga crazy
Think I'm finna pull a Wavves on the Primavera stage
On some prima donna shit, finna throw it all away
I don't need no accolades, boy I'm here to act a fool
Ask about me, had the shotty, robbin' niggas at the school
Me and Pac Slimm, we been shootin' since the Vans song
Pullin' any trigger that a nigga got his hands on
Lookin' at my vida, all this money, all these visas
All these mothafuckin' mini mes I know they wanna be him
Either with it or against it nigga, ain't no in-betweenin'
If you say you wanna kill the man then dump it when you see him pussy

Is it real?
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real?
Real, real
Is it? Is it real?
Is it real, real? Is it it real?
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real, real, real
Real killer shit, real nigga shit, real militant
Once you get addicted to it
Is it real?

[A$AP Rocky:]
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it
Once you get addicted to it

Little sunshine
Fed up with the gun violence
Fed up with the old rules
Fed up with the youth dyin'
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
I just wanna live forever
Fed up with the songs singin'
Fed up with the gang bangin'
Fed up with the same things
Fed up with my life changin'
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better
I just wanna show you better


How you doing everybody hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I lay
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I know they wanna see me fall I know the fraudulent I know
I know they hoping that it's right back to the ghettos I go
I know my pigment is not that of a businessmen
I know they think I'm ignorant I'm fucking up my privilege
I know that money come and go so money not my motive no mo'
I made enough to know I'll never make enough for my soul
I turned my back on my friends
I turned my back on my home
I left the street where I've grown
To chase the yellow brick road
I heard they paved it with gold I turned around and seen they pissed on it
Just like me
But that's alright because my soul burning please set me free
I hope to see you in another life times mines just not for me
Can't you see?

Every night up on my knees I pray
Smile for me
That everything will change and be ok
Smile for me
Maybe I'll stay maybe I'll pass away
Smile for me
I'm holding on to what the pastor say
Smile for me

Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Smile for me
Cause when life gets hard
And you just think
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
When life gets hard
And you can't breathe
You wanna end it all
Smile for me
Smile for me

How you doing everybody hope you had a nice day
Sometimes I feel all alone
Sometimes I can't get away
I feel my life is in danger every night when I pray
So could you do me a favor, smile for me?

I don't love you, you don't love me, we should give it up
Wish I felt your body without me getting my feeling's touched
People tell me I'm too young and I should live it up
How could you not feel that? These freaks wanna give it up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Don't say you feel my pain cause I don't even feel myself
Blood rushing through my brain, sometimes I wanna kill myself
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Motion of the ocean waves capsize me, baptize my frame
Salt water inside my wounds, still don't know who to blame
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Sometimes I feel like giving up


[Andre 3000:]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God... with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock a... put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

[Vince Staples:]
Born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, born ready, war ready, war ready, your boys' lost already

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think I'm heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or I'm embracing silly
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thing to a G
Life give lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Coke game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fucked to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, hell, free, jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit
A wise man once said that a black man better off dead
So I'm, war ready


I need a sixty minutes
We leave you on the cement, we creeping, the windows tinted
My nigga, Iâve been authentic
You mad âcuz you minuscule
I will snatch your forbidden fruit
Show your daughter what dickâll do
Crime rate through the roof, one time missinâ proof
To sit us in the cell, so we givinâ niggas hell
Ship it, zip it, sit it on a scale
Do it in reverse though
Fuck being broke, itâs way too commercial
Bruh did things shouldâve been in a hearse for
Bodies on the waterfront, washed another hurt soul
Never gave a fuck though
Laughinâ in the gun smoke
Hammers like the depot and tablets like the drug store

[SK La'Flare:]
Itâs HOVÂ­
Got the block on swollâ like Sub Zero
And you know, Iâm La Flare, I ainât got no heroes
Tell them niggas to beware. We ainât got no fears, ho
This is rare, you could find them niggas at Sears, though
Iâm one of a kind, I donât even try
Gunnin to shine, Iâm running your mind
Killing these niggas, one at a time
Play my song, the function is mine

[SK La'Flare:]
And thatâs real talk nigga
Donât act like you donât know
Itâs money

[SK La'Flare:]
Ey itâs Horus, Horus, and my bitch is gorgeous
She icy like Isis, she shine like the morninâ
Goddess iron ma white tee, she know Iâm important
Ma dro imported, and my plug deported
Heâll be back by fall though
Iâm in the trap, no walls ho
Cookin CRACK in that loft ho
Work packed in that Tahoe
I serve packs with barcodes
U slackin like Waldo
You was acting and got robbed ho
You should get a job ho
This path, is not meant for you
Messages not sent for you
You in too deep, Iâm in the coupe
Suede seats, she feel the truth
Donât hate me, I'mma take her to a new world, new order
This feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu, something new-Â­-Â­
I thought I told you


In '76 you know they stop fighting
Niggas start shooting
You know it was something new to me
You know we use to fight all the time
The next minute I'm runnin from gunshots
So, the only thing I said to myself
Say man are we gonna start doing what they're doing
You know the same thing they do to us
We do to them
[?] but you had to either do or die
Or stay in the house
You know fight or stay in the house
So I wasn't gon' stay in the house for nobody...

I ain't never really care about shit
Soon as my father abandoned his kids
I was down for the problems
I promised my momma
I wasn't gonna die, so I got this revolver
Hammers will heal what a fist can't fix
Won't get down I'mma sent 'bout six
Ain't no question I'm wit' that shit
On the highway to hell
But it still ain't jail
Gotta plug in the scale
Tryna make this money
Crooked ass police tryna take this from me
Either watch yo step, or you catch that weap(weapon)
Niggas take your life 'cuz you ain't worth shit
Tell my momma don't trust not a soul that she meet
9 times outta ten niggas just like me
Tryna some up off the next man
Hammer in my left hand

[Hook:]
Voice from grandma yelling from the dead
She said just pray to sweet Lord Jesus
But he can't do shit, when you bleedin
Still ain't got no food in that freezer
You gon' do whatever you need cuz
God don't come when there's niggas at the door
Shimmy shimmy ya, I'mma give to him raw
Roaches in the hallway,sleeping on the floor
Welcome to the land of the lost and destroyed

My brother Smalls, told a nigga focus on the money
But why try when they tryna take a nigga under
Spend a thousand every-time a nigga make a hundred
And they wonder why I'm wild when I'm out in public
Demons form in the presences of nothing but struggle
It's easy to hustle when knowing nobody love you
Ain't nothing to lose
This money to gain
Fuck playin' by the rules, shoot him his brain
Life change when you take shit by the range
Sitting in the rain wit' a Glock nine
Waiting for the bus on Ximeno
I wish a bitch would roll by on some funny shit
Niggas know I got mines
Hard times make nigga face hard time in a cell
Never heard of hell, only heard of home
Hardly ever there
Shit I rather roam

[Hook x1]

If 1st and 2nd Corinthians
Could give a nigga spinnin rims or Christina Milian
I'll prolly give that shit a chance
Coulda went the college route
But I choose the nigga plan
Broken heart sitting on my path try and watch my step
God bless a child with a gift then he turned his back
Told him choose his own way
Guess I choose the wrong way
But it's only one way
Either wit'the gunplay
Or you getting dumped on, nigga ain't a soul safe
I live my life as if a nigga could get killed tonight
Niggas running at they mouth like they wanna die
I ain't the passive nigga most would probably wanna try
In the land of the lost only the strong survive
Ridin' round wit' 4s under the seat
In a four door jeep that's 400 hundred degrees
Looking for my enemies
They haunt me when I sleep
So any motherfucker that taunt me getting shot

My name is Vince Staples
I don't represent nothin..
It's gonna be for you niggas real soon
It's gonna be over for you real soon


Turnt down niggas get they bitch shot at
Catch ya baby momma slipping at the laundrymat
Got the whole crowd cheering like Fonzie back
My army strapped, blazed where Bonzi at?
Got em wishing at the well that they see a nigga fail
Rather see me in jail then doing well like the white folk
They ain't even want Mike Jones, still tippin
Leave the tip on the table as I serve you niggas
I still ride around the city like I murder niggas
Bad hoes get Roethlisberger'd
No lies, preserve
Curb That, Enthusiasm just a lil bit
We ain't' fucking round with them rounds, cuh they still equipped
Warfare, Guerrilla clips, hold that, throwback, Darko Milicic
Sons got lojack, find ya babysitter crib, run up in that ho and blow that lil' muhfucka away
Is it wrong if I say, I'm feeling better than anybody's ever been
Herring Bone chain and some skeletons, pelicans
Rap niggas telling fibs, you ain't really selling shit
If you is, lead yo crib up like cheap paint
I tell my niggas C-safe cause the beach ain't
Most the niggas telling you to practice what you preach fake
You never talk about the dirt that you do
Cause in interrogation pigs can say that heard that from, you

And real niggas don't play by the rules, we just go hard
In yo front yard with the tools, let em dump off
Called Matlock, got the case dropped
Riding all around yo city with the safe off [x2]
Nigga...


Nigga I don't got no homies
Forty on me like I'm Kemp
Oxycontin smothered the 'partment
And I'm trappin' like a bitch
Movin' molly monthly
My momma asked how I make the rent
I make the rent by making flips
Livin' like it's '86
I'm tryin' to sign for eighty bricks
Been listenin' to Gucci a lot
But I ain't goin' out like Dunkin
And so I'm thumpin'
Niggas hardly down for dumpin'
Let it bang like Chief Keef
Aim at the police
Paint up your whole street
Twelve gauge, big as a flamethrower
I'm feelin' like Kane in Wrestlemania
Shells inside that chamber duck
Honey hit your famouser
Hoes be in that Fetal stance
Firearms big as Digimon now watch my diddy dance
Flip a gram to get a grand
Real niggas stay masked up like Rick Hamilton
Tryin' to get my dough stacked up and buy the Vatican
Ninth grade Mayfair High, I snuck the hammer in
Glock's nine the match was ten

[Hook - SK La'flare x2:]
Ay, bitch I'm really on it, on it
Y'all silly, me funny
I traffic willy still I'm pumpin'
My pockets gettin' swolen
It's my grams rollin'
Bitch clips loaded, yeah

This a game you gotta shoot to play
My burner givin' boosie fades
Long Beach pb killa, I'll take it to my grave
Fuck the first forty eight and any nigga sayin' shit
We got the same guns as police and quick to spray a bitch
ARs and shit, get your whole department lit
Forty fours like Maravich
No droppin' dimes or shot attempts
Fuck the swine, I'm in the streets
Seven days out of the week
Still ain't reach my peak
So just take your seat and enjoy the show

[Hook]


[Hook:]
When intensity is risen
Women end up having children
By niggas who didn't love in the first place
Gave it up on the first date
Now she fucked in the worst way
(we don't love these hoes)

She was cute, was only trying to fuck her though
But I broke the rules, now I gotta come for hoes
Told her from the jump, that I wasn't into loving hoes
And she wouldn't be any different from my other hoes
Since a young nigga, I knew she would become a ho
Eighth grade year, sucking dick behind the bungalows
Daddy had a bunch of dough, paid her no attention
Only paid the whole tuition, gave her extra cash for spending
She was pheeming for the type of life she wasn't given
Hanging with them shady niggas in and out of prison
Thought a baby was the perfect way to keep his interest
Soon aborted when she saw he wasn't fucking with it
Cold nigga, gut checked, but she rolled wit it
Packed up, left home, took her soul wit him
Now it seems that she's only good for one thing
The one thing that we all need
Eyes dry, but her heart bleed

[Hook]


[Sk La'Flare:]
Yeah nigga im out here shinin
You see me bitch, I dont see you though
Fake ass, fraud ass rap niggas
You on twitter though
Where you hidin at? Imma find you
Little word of advice bitch nigga
Dont sleep!

Heavy Duty shots out the Uzi into your momma's house
Clip your momma on the couch
Now your momma running out the back door
Car-bomb strapped to her black Ford
Won't make it out the hospital tonight
You see I try to be a civil dude but bitches can get it to
Lying to the Johnny's like these rappers do in interviews
It's wavy in the beach, but nigga's crazy in the beach
It'd be smart to keep 380's where you sleep
I need a bitch like Brandy
We can make a baby in the Jeep
She's drove me crazy since "Moesha"
I'd really like to meet you
Niggas asking me for features
But nobody's talking monetary
Probably the reason why you never hear me

[Hook:]
Tell all the girls clap your hands
You comin' out of them pants
I don't ask or make demands
But I'm the mothafuckin' man
Can someone tell them broads
They comin' out of them draws
I swear to God I love you all
Where's my round of applause at?
We cashin' all checks
Don't call the laws yet
My niggas dogs no need to get them involved
Cause them guns come out like the summertime sun
Yeah them guns come out like the summertime

I'm takin' niggas bitches
Like Bowser, I pound her
You hound her
I never been sympathetic for simping
Niggas act like the women
They crying over, Invite her over
Dig her out then kick her out
Raw dog her then dog don't call until them kids is out
See I take a different route
Where everything I do
Where some little shit to me
Could be like everything to you
You could give a wedding ring
To a girl you'll never screw
And I apologize for that it must suck to be a fool
I'm tactical
Been crackin' hoes since secondary school
We trappin' hoes, selling 4 and 5's for the price of 2
I was taught that the life you live is the life you choose
I chose the path of a winner, now shake that ass for a nigga

[Hook]


Yeah Nigga
They told me they need a leader
I told them niggas my feature price
Music mean nothing to me if I ain't eatin' right
Momma told me better see the light before they cut him off
Fuck what's wrong and right if it's a gun involved
Then I'm drumming off, Nigga
Ricky Ricardo going where only God knows
Beatin' the block I'm feedin' the block
They want us all broke. Women getting they heart broke
Prison is where our dads call home
So we don't see 'em in our homes
Nigga we from Long Beach
So Dre and Eazy never been our heros
And California niggas that see plays is weirdos
Lying like a mothafucka
Soon it's gon' be niggas dying like a mothafucka
Fry em' like a mothafucka
I'm sick in my thoughts and sick in my soul
Never let a bitch in my heart nor a bitch in my home
Why care about a broad when all my family gone
So till' they free the packs fuck true love I don't believe in that
You run your mouth then I'm meetin' that
I won't tweet you back
I'll just see you black out
And leave you passed out
Bleedin' and shit
Feeding them clips, I'm the Hollow Man
Take a nigga life he ain't got no plans
We anybody killer we ain't got no friends (No friends)
Now back to the story at hand
They handed me nothing, I took it in stride
Take a shot at your head
For taking shots at my pride
The only son my momma got that she can talk to
So you don't want no problems, that's never been a smart move


It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a

Fuck the DA, fuck the P
Fuck the president, fuck the Popo
They follow me, wanna keep me close
Try to hold me back, let me go
I sip the drank I sip the drank
Pick up the phone and call Michel'le
She hold me down, I gotta make the plan
If the plan don't get me then I don't care
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see
A whole lot of lives depended on me
But I hold it down I hold it down
I check in when I'm not in town
Put on a smile girl, put on a smile
Its a lot on my shoulders, I gotta balance it out
Put on a smile girl, put on a smile
I take care of you and that child

It's harder for a real nigga (hey)
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a

Gotta go to the courthouse
Judge ain't giving a fuck, oww
My fingerprints is they evidence
What the fuck I'ma do now?
So hold me tight, hold me close
My lifestyle got me doing the most
Fuck that, let's make a toast the Lord keep us alive, he never take our soul
I'm praying up, I'm praying up
This a must that I can't sleep I stay up
Pops told me to change up but if I change up they gonna say I changed up
When everybody depend on you, you got nobody to run to
You got nobody to come to, when they come through you feel like fuck you

It's harder for a real nigga (hey)
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a real nigga
It's ten times harder for a

Lord, please give me life
Life we need, please Lord

Bomptown finest
Bomptown finest
Look, uh, nigga, Bomptown's finest

I done did the unexpected
They countin' niggas out, now them dickheads respect us
You unsure about me bein' successful
Well, I'm unsure about your ass standin' in my section
'Cause I done put in overtime, caught cases, pop straps when Pop think I lost my mind
Where I'm from they try to hate and politic
But fuck that, buy a strap, slow them up with hollow tips
I'm, self made, self paid, self safe of everythang
And that Maybach doin' donuts, bitch
I'm in Bompton, still hitting' corners
And if the 'Gnac gone, niggas still sip Corona
I done made me, I feel good about it
But them suckas try to tell me, take the hood up out me
Who would Master P be if he wasn't "'Bout It 'Bout It"?
Or HOV without the Marcy Projects

I'm Bomptown's finest, yeah, nigga
Bomptown's finest, 4Hunnid, 4
Nigga, Bomptown's finest, yeah
Bomptown's finest, uh

Now when I pull up, everything exotic
Can't complain, life's sweet, blue drank, Hpnotiq
The past year I've been makin' all profit
My team finally got it, then somebody shot me
Damn, that's just the Devil, my nigga
But thank god it ain't end with a shovel, my nigga
Have it dusted off my shoulders like whatever, my nigga
And Frogg ain't gone, he live forever, my nigga
Rest in peace to my nigga Frogg
You know your 4Hunnid niggas out here, doing they shit, nigga
My nigga gone but never forgotten
You know anytime I bheese, I told you what's poppin'
Uh, so y'all niggas finally made it
Buddha still the same, you know that nigga brazy
You know when small niggas hatin'
There's money being made now so niggas started changin'
And Game just dropped Documentary 2
He got some bangers on there, and what he talkin' about true
I know you and Peso had issues, but real shit, it seem that nigga miss you
Your kids, I took them Christmas shopping
You know me, I'ma do my part, nigga I gotchu
I know you watchin' so you know what's up with G man
He was just worried about his kids and his freeman
Your mom said that you said, we was on bad terms
Man that shit work a nigga nerves
But long as Lil Buddha on this Earth, its long live Lil Frogg that's my word

Nigga Bomptown's finest
Ayy, nigga Bomptown's finest
Ayy, nigga, Bomptown's finest
This is Bomptown's finest
Nigga, Bomptown's finest

Third verse, three years later, still Piruin' it, still gettin' paper
Gotta tell you about the homies, whole lot up in the makin'
Teebee, yeah that's my nigga, but we ain't talk much lately
Me and H fell out, me and Mustard fell out
Me and you fell out 'cause there was some shit you didn't tell me 'bout
But I ain't even trippin' 'cause I get the bigger picture
Big Buddha that's my nigga, so you know you my nigga
Turtle gone, Chica-gone, Buddha three call you know I answer my phone
High nigga skinny jeans, be the realest from the team
This how them old niggas holla behind the scene
And baby Buddha, my Tree Top trooper
Big homies don't love ya 'cause they ain't say nothin' to ya
But in real time the shit out here be too tough
Gotta stay dangerous, gotta keep touped up
Hoppin' out with two tucked doin' too much
Don't give two fucks livin' like I can't lose much
Fuck luck, hit the bottle, now I'm fucked up
Spread the money out
Pistol goes around, come around, nigga, nunchucks
Blow it once okay, blow it twice, you a dumb fuck
I done took homies off the block
Who knows how many homies I done saved from gettin' popped
Look at Slim he ain't gotta sell rocks
I told him figure out this rap shit, then you buy the block
Look it's like 800, lookin' like money
I told him save that shit don't spend it all on the day
Ayy Buddha, ru' you know what it ru'
We got some shit in the makin', it's bomin' soon
Went from slangin' to bangin' and burglaries before school
Then finesse this rap shit on Piru

Bomptown's finest
Ayy, nigga Bomptown's finest
Ayy nigga, Bomptown's finest
This is Bomptown's finest
Nigga, Bomptown's finest

Self, self, self, self, self, self
This all I got but all I hear is help (help)
Since a youngin' I been getting used to sex, money, and guns
Bitches wanna fuck who they want because I been number one
Use me for the dick because they love fuckin' a blood

Slow down on the drink, bitch I'm from the street

[Verse 1]
It was 1 in the mornin' and I was up yawnin'
Moms asked where I'm goin', to the hood if you ain't knowin'
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
I was out the house, ASAP Rocky
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
We was her babies, she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama, mama said "fuck 'em then"
I was in the streets stylin', nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed

[Hook]
But now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?

[Verse 2]
SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission
On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga, so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's when he leave me


[Hook: Natasha Mosley]
Ain't no tellin' where we goin' when we rollin' on the West Side
Me and my homies we rollin' up until the sun rise
And I didn't want to fuck him but I did it just to get by
I, get, no, sleep that Bompton life
I didn't want to get him but I got him nigga 459
You get it how you livin' when you dealin' with the Bompton life

[Verse 1: YG]
I was out plottin', Batman, Robin
Pops was in jail, I was out poppin'
I was with the homies, you was with your bitch
You was thinkin' love, I was thinkin' rich
Everything got took, flatscreens, notebooks
Even paintings and I was an artist in the making
Used choppers, jewelry boxes, loafers made by Prada
At the pawn shop like what you got I needed all of that
Grind to shine to greedy that's how it had to be
If I ain't know you, to me you was just another robbery
Uh, clubs in the fat head
And if the neighbors saw us we got ghost like Pac Man

[Hook: Natasha Mosley]

[Verse 2: YG]
Cops comin' out runnin'
I'm thuggin', the bird come out duckin'
Hopin' they don't shoot
You only get once chance to make it to the top, and we takin' shots like hoops
I hit the wall, I hit the corner, I'm in the yard, We on the roof top
Like fuck we finna get caught, hurry and toss the ooh wa
And the freedom change the situation
And fuck the police, them handcuffs is irritatin'
Just wonder what my mom gon' say
When they lock me up and send me miles aways, had to take it day to day
Make you express and share relates
Catchin' cases and catchin' fades
I was in the County makin' plays
You was in the Country duckin' fades
I got a stripe and took it as a live learn lesson
They let me out of jail I was two steppin'

[Hook]

[Outro: Natasha Mosley]
It's alright and it's okay
459 we roll this way
East side, West side Bompton gang
We still function we don't care
Gotta respect my struggle
Understand my hustle
Nothin' but a G thang baby
It's nothin' but a G thang baby
459


[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block like what
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house trying to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA, I don't play that bitch
Iâm a real Bompton nigga with a motherfucking attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chilling, homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shooting, my homies went back shooting
Ainât nobody hittin' nothing, man this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Verse 2, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down the guns come out
Click clack bow bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas, that's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfucking biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wick
Niggas be lurking, bitches be slurping
Niggas got caught up on them Nextelâs chirpin
It's a must in the county, I ain't have no pagers
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbating
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios

[Interlude]
Ey nigga, nigga, nigga, I got a whole zone right now
Like right now right now
Like what you trying to do right now?

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Meanwhile at a home invasion near you
These niggas was robbing your shit


[Verse 1]
Nigga, I'm from Bompton
Talking that shit nigga get yo' ass boobopped-like-boowop
Pop-pop, that's two shots
My shooters in the hood going ham, they need to woosa
Niggas ain't beefing with a hamburger
I'm on Rosecrans nigga at Tam's Burgers
I'm buying AK's and handguns
Through the enemies foul, nigga; and-1
I'm really with the shit though
I'm really on the block with a pistol
Let it blow like a whistle
Yo' mom's looking like she do crystal
I'm a hundred rack boy
But daddy is a bitch and you a son of that boy

[Hook]
Nigga I'm from Bompton
That's why yo' bitch wanna fuck
And yo' homies don't like me cause they know where I'm from
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I be really in the hood though
Mama never understood though
Nigga I'm from Bompton
New shit dropping, whip copping, nigga I'm popping
Nigga I'm from Bompton
Where the Crips say, "errrb"
And the bitch niggas get on my nerves

[Verse 2]
I'm buying choppers like tennis shoes
And I hate doing interviews
Cause criminals don't like talking
I don't go to funerals, I don't like coffins
You wasn't catching fades in the county
Niggas told you "roll it up" and you was out it
I got Crips they be TG'd up
I heard you hit the county and be PCâd up
Your bitch fuck me cause I'm poppin'
I be on the block when the police watching
And if you cross the street, there's a store there
But that's the enemy store we don't go there
Nigga I'm from Bompton
I know ese's and all my enemies bitches wanna sex me
All my YG's give it up, enemies hit 'em up
West side Tree Top gang, we don't give a fuck

[Hook]


[Hook:]
Nigga I'm from BPT
West Side, West Side
TTP, what block, what block
400, Spruce Street
What y'all doin'?
Nigga kill off all beef

[Verse 1:]
Iâm a Westside get brackin' in the back like whatâs happnin'
That 40 Glock snap like Insta, ain't no need for a caption
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it
'Hamad threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect, woo!
That's how I got put on
Tree Top Bompton, yeah I got put on
It was hard in the hood
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood
I know Game from cedar block, Dom from the West
[?] and Pac [?]
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on
Niggas gotta go, we can't hold on

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'
Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence
That's a principal of proof, the definition of logic
That this nigga is bitch, every chance he get he's dodgin'
I brought back this West Coast shit
And this the mothafuckin' thanks I get?
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga ain't snitch
That's how it's s'posed to go down
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down
Give you a blind date, have my bitch pick you up
Then have one of my Top members stick you up
I know Nipsey from 60, C-Hood from 10-4
Tiny Bone from 40 Crip, thatâs my kinfolk
My whole family tried to save me but it didn't work
Momma know I've been bangin' lately, nigga


[Hook: Teeflii]
Annie, girl, let's play house
And you can show me what that's 'bout
Girl, nobody beat the pussy up like me
Who you know that beat the pussy up like me?
Girl, I'm gonna lay you on your back
Bam-bam, beat it like that
I'm a do it to ya, do it to ya
I'm a do it to ya, if you, if you let me
Girl, I'll do it to ya, I'll do it to ya
Girl, I'll do it to ya, do it to ya
Eat it, beat it, bang like ah!

[Verse 1: YG]
I know you had a long day baby, I know!
The 9 to 5 shift probably seem like all day baby
You're 'bout your money so you're probably working overtime huh?
Cause that minimum wage just ain't enough
Long as your'e getting it, more power to ya
Make a nigga wanna be the guy to give it to ya
Long as you're not sitting up on your ass
That'll make a real man say hallelujah!
You got a son and you're raising him by yourself
You need a real one in your life
It ain't no probably, it's obvious that
Your baby daddy didn't do you right
I got a mama, girl I know how to treat a woman
I like dessert, girl I know to eat a woman
Lay with it, then play with it, I beat it up
I know I'm sinning but before I eat it I'll say my grace in it
What?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm going down on you first
The real definition of down to earth
I ain't the one you ask to buy you a purse
I'm the one to make your insides hurt
From the back with your face in the pillow
From that position I know that you can only take a little
But missionary she can take the whole thang
It's so good I have her screaming out my government name
And she ain't never got to tell me how she want it
I'm a real one baby, I'm already knowing
She said her nigga's shit's weak
Cause he ain't make her nut and they was fucking 'til the morning
You know it fire when she's telling you to nut in her
But I'm a nigga, I'm thinking something up with her
I know the homies might think a nigga's krazy
But you could fuck around and have my first baby
What?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I said face down ass up
That's the way we likes to fuck
Do my dirt on the low
That's the way shit's 'sposed to go

But I be tryna hit it right at the wrong time
I said it's yours, you say it's mine, Shit we both lying
We both tryna 69 and some more time
My girl tryna FaceTime hitting both lines

[Skit:]
[Girl:] Oww you fuck me better than my nigga! [x2]

[Narrator:] (Mean while why YG's fuckin his side bitch, His main bitch was creepin on the low)
[YG:] She was with who?
[Narrator:] "typical nigga shit"


[Hook: YG]
Mama ain't raised no fool
Daddy told me never leave the house without my tool
Grandpa told me never trust a sucka nigga from the street
Grandma said she love me and she always praying for me
But I just wanna party, I donât wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna party, I don't wanna hurt nobody
But Iâll beat the fuck out of a nigga

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm drunk off Hennessy
Hope I don't run into my enemies
That dark liquor give you energy
Now I ain't rich, but I'm finna be
Your baby mama's a flip, she wanna hit a G
I'm back on that bullshit
But she ain't fuckin' and that's bullshit
I can't die, I got too much to live for
I'm getting money, that's what niggas rob and kill for
Fucking with Tenisha and Keisha
But when Keisha see Tenisha she gon' whoop her ass
All my homies gangbangers
They dry their clothes on hangers
All these hoes fuckin', but they don't wanna seem like a ho
So you gotta hit 'em on the low (hit em' on the D-Low!)
West side, get money gang
Socked the mouth for trippin', he lost his watch and earrings

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Schoolboy Q]
Nigga, I'm from Hoover Street
Dirty pictures in my cellphone
On 52nd street I'm well-known
Hoover stomp until the cops come
Silver satin get the job done
Money ain't everything, but still I'm rich
Money ain't everything, I'm still gon' crip
From Figueroa to Harv Side where we sock on lips
We break on jaws, niggas since VCR's, nigga
We hope out cars, nigga
I be groovin' 'til I die
Smokin' weed until I'm fried
I could sell a key to God
Pants saggin' with the Glock
I ain't wanna pick the box
All my homies gangbangers
We keep a thumb between our two fingers
We trippin' off the Henny
So don't let me catch you slippin' in the 50's, Ricky

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Nigga, I'm from Bounty Hunters, East Side lunatic
Gang bang, slap a bitch
I ain't with the extras, I ain't got a stunt double
You ain't got no hands so they might let the gun touch you
Is you bangin' or you ballin', nigga?
You a fax machine, we can't call it, nigga
Everybody ain't a friend, reason why I keep a fo'
You wanna gamble with your life, bet that on the tender-fold, nigga
She bouncing that ass, go ahead shake it
And if she give me that back, bitch, I'ma break it
Shit, that pussy is overrated, some niggas'll chase it
She acting like she be nuttin', some bitches are fakin'
You fightin' to save many souls, know that you losin'
These bitches the reason why some niggas be snoozin'
YG, dawg, you heard how they left his brains hanging?
Shouldn't have chunked his fingers up if he ain't bangin'
I'm sayin'...

[Hook]

[Outro]
But I'll beat the fuck out of a bitch
Why you bullshitting?


Okay, okay, okay. Told her bust it open she said okay.
But what she wearin? Chanel & Dolce. How she want it?
Beat up like O.J. Skurt, Skurt on a bitch nigga.
How much time do you got for a rich nigga?
I need action while relaxin, and a bitch that knows gymnastics so
She can divide her legs on this dick like a fraction.
Right, Right, Left. Hit em with that Right, Left.
I got that best stroker, I don't need no pipe test.
My dick work girl, I don't need no mic check, no panties on I can see your pussy through that white dress.
I ain't trippin baby girl make that money, cus if I fuck her right she just might give somethin to me, and better yet...
Fuck with me for better sex I know all the right spots to keep that punani wet.

Girl you know you look fine as hell right?
You know I'll buy you that Chanel right?
You know I'll fuck you like I'm fresh outta of jail right?
And if you cheated on me I won't care right? (She make that ass go)
Left, Left, Right
Right, Left, Left, Right (She make that ass go)
Right, Left, Left, Right
Right, Left, Left, Right.

I'm a Pisces. She's a Taurus. She said she expensive. Well. I could afford it.
Never pay for it, but I could explore it, have your tongue out and legs cocked open like Jordan.

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Used to have a girlfriend
Now all I got is hoes
Just looking for a down girl
But she was fuckin on the low

[Verse 1: YG]
Hair done, nails did, caramel complexion
Pussy stayed wet like she was mixed with Mexican
Love I invested in, Trust I invested in
So if she wasn't fucking with me I was stressing it
Wasn't no questioning, pussy was mine
Wasn't no questioning, Bonnie and Clyde
Still living in my momma house, but I let her move in
Momma thought I was tricking
But really I was just choosin', that was my bitch
I was claiming her when we was fucking
My bitch, wasn't using condoms no nothing
I was in love, she came first before my homies
Like fuck it, I'm 'bout to get your name tatted on me

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
And that was me and my bitch
Knowin that these hoes ain't shit
Me and my bitch
Cause nigga ridin' on that Westside shit

[Verse 2: YG]
Damn, I caught the bitch cheating
Damn, she was with him last weekend
What you mean you gon' call right back?
What you mean you ain't got time like that?
She fucked the nigga I knew
Ain't really fucked with his crew
I did a song with his brother
And she fucked with him too
All that shit she was talking
She wasn't really 'bout it
And it made it even worse
When my homie told me 'bout it
I gave you your swag, told you to dress like that
I hit your spot, made you say "yes!" like that
And they ask me why I trust no bitch
Cause my ex had me feeling all embarrassed and shit

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: YG]
Now she tryna get me back tho
I had her sneakin, creepin through the back door
I was horny, I just wanted to fuck
I bust a nut in ten minutes I was in a rush
Reality, I hit it and she sad now
She pregnant, she know I coulda been a dad now
She text me like "I love you"
I text her back like "fuck you"
I looked down and looked up
Her best friend ain't shit cause my best friend hooked em up
But she know a nigga rich now
She text me like "I'm stylin"
She just wanna be my bitch now

[Hook]


[Verse 1: YG]
First, you find a house and scope it out
Find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don't believe in bank accounts
Second, you find a crew and a driver, someone who ring the doorbell
And someone that ain't scared to do what it do
Third, you pull up at the spot
Park, watch, ring the doorbell and knock
Four, make sure nobody is home
They gone, okay it's on
Don't be scared, nigga, you're in now
If the police come you gonna find out who your friends now
That ain't them talking, that's your mind playing tricks on you
You're conscious cause you know you got nines with two clips on you
But fuck that, motherfuck that plasma
And fuck that laptop, go and get that jewelry box
You tryna get paid?
Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson they'll give you cash back in the same day

[Hook: YG]
Meet the motherfucking flockers
Make some noise if you've ever stole something in your life
Don't be ashamed, it's okay, baby
Make some noise if you've ever stole a dollar out your mama's purse
[?]

[Verse 2: Tee Cee]
Niggas don't know the history 'bout the fly
Put the flathead in the door
Pull it, make it go fly
Hit the first drawer, grab a nigga some socks
That nigga in the car better be listening to that box
Ay, I ain't staking out shit, nigga
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe and ding dong ditch
Ain't a safe I can't crack, nigga, that's on Crip
I'm with my Pirus from Compton, we gon' pass and get rich
50 racks, three niggas, 65 a split
Let some weeks go by we at the dealership
I never took notes
Nigga I need the pink slip
Hit Icey, making up for my bullshit
Spent about ten cash
We jumped into the whip and did the whole dash
Deez-Lo my nigga, my nigga
Hit my first lick pass with my niggas


Keenon!

You gon' end up in motherfucking jail, like your damn daddy

So when I see you out I'm like hey, my nigga

Me and my nigga riding dirty, tryna chase them figures
Who got the yola? who got the yola? Don't matter, go figure

I said that I'm a ride for my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger

[YG]
I'm talkin 'bout puttin' on, ridin' out; Glocks in my ma's house
Front you with that work (I done fronted niggas work - OH-OHHH~!)
You say you want that head up but we don't fight fair brah
Catch you slippin' from your backside, they knock you out
Ace gon' stomp you out then Buddah gon' stomp you out
(Has momma ever see you with a busted eye and busted mouth?!)
Nine milli pokin' out, fo-fizzy pokin' out
Death Row days, show you what this West Coast about

[Lil Wayne]
I'd die for my motherfuckin' nigga
Jump in front a bullet for my motherfuckin' nigga
On the stand I'd lie for my motherfuckin' nigga
Rob a bank, I'd drive for my motherfuckin' nigga
Real talk, I don't really fuck with too many niggas
Cause niggas drop a dime on you like a couple nickels
I be laughin' to the bank like the fuckin' money tickle
Drivin' somethin' that you ain't, top boss, suck a nipple
And I never put a ho before my bro, don't beef over no hoe
And my niggas sell them keys if you can't open your door
Hope you buy for my motherfuckin' niggas
When it rains it pours, it's dry for me and my fuckin' niggas, he-heh
I kill for my motherfuckin' niggas
Vice versa, eyes red from the kush I blew white person
Got my middle finger on the trigger and with my little finger to you niggas
I swear it's fuck all y'all niggas... except my niggas
OWW~!

[Chorus - Rich Homie Quan (Wayne & Rich Homie):]
I said that I'm a ride for my motherfuckin' nigga (Tunechi!)

And when we on that lean, we ain't fuckin' with the liquor (no)
I'm a buy a hundred bottles just to give it to the bitches (to the bitches)
... She keep likin' all my pictures
Cause she see the way I ball, how my wrist and that be lit up
Catch you at the red light, have 'em screamin' "Can't get up!" (YOU CAN'T)
Same nigga from the bottom, ain't a damn thing change
C-C-Catch me out in Collins screamin' "Money ain't a thang"
In a red Mulsanne, lookin' like I claim blood
And if homie ain't my homie then I know it ain't love
Screamin' out "4 Hunnid!" YG that's my nigga (my nigga)
Cause I been in the field life on the line with' him (line with' him)
And if it's really good, why I prolly die with' 'em (die with' 'em)

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I just got 250 thousand dollars for a verse, nigga
I-I don't know, is it me or it's your thirst, nigga?
You nig, you niggas ain't got no joints
Like a injured Chris Paul, you ain't got no point
I just come through with a couple bossy bitches
They get money too, they some "don't cross me bitches"
Flossy bitches, Sergio Rossi, bitches
And if we at the game then it's floor seat, bitches!
I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I ride for my bitches
I'm so fuckin' rich I cop rides for my bitches
Dollar menu fries, apple pies, out the bitches
I drop a freestyle and get a rise outta bitches; bitches, my bitches
I need a nigga with some Diff'rent Strokes - Todd Bridges
Shout out to my MAIN bitches and my side bitches
Need a nigga with some good neck - ostriches
... My niggas

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj - over Chorus]
New York to Compton
Got YG with me so don't get stomped in, uh-huh

And when you come out, it's gon' burn you bitches like
You better get your motherfuckin' oven mitt, BITCH~!
{"Mustard on the beat, ho~! "} HA-HAAAAA!


[Verse 1: YG]
I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be going through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
I swear I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas want it, you're dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, where's the family support?
He knew who shot him, but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga

[Hook x2: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be going through some things, you don't know what I've been thinkin'

[Verse 2: YG]
Now I'm ridin' through traffic with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care
That's why bitches get fucked, then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them less talk, more sex
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happens if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it, then buy my lolo some new spokes
Right up in your fake setup, fuck you up like some mace
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh lawd, where is the world today?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I smoke this industry shit, to me it's one big ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga strip
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been known Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile I'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo snow bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up, I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes in my face, bro, and I've really been drinkin'
Why the fuck I've really been smokin'?
What the fuck, I'm the sober one
When I'm so stressed out I can't focus
Hideout when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cut-lass-me and little Ocho
And we young nigga hop out
2 tears in a bucket, I feel like fuck it
That's the price of fame, recognize my pain, that's all I know
All alone, but I'm out here though
Call my troops like vamonos
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Of OG with my OG and some OE, but the tall glass

[Hook]


[Verse 1: YG]
Momma said I ain't acting like her son
Cause I'm getting money Momma, you ain't giving me none
You can't buy me them J's that come out tomorrow
So get used to the things that I'm doing for dollars
You said: "Boy, you better watch your back
Your pops in jail, remember that"
Momma it get like that
You said: "Don't call me for no bail money"
Thought I could call for anything, I thought you cared for me
You said: "Keenon, keep that bitch out my house"
I said I'm 18
You said: "This your place?" Nah, this is Section 8
Smacked me like bah, "you little disrespectful nigga"
Like mmm... momma you lucky, lucky I can't hit ya
"You gon' treat me like this? And you know I have seizures
You know I take pain pills for headaches and fevers"
Damn, now I'm feeling less than a man
Cause you birth me and I was actin' like I couldn't understand
I'm sorry momma...

[Hook: Ty Dolla Sign]
I'm sorry momma
Let me take some weight off your shoulders
I'm singing to momma
You ain't gotta worry now, them days is over

[Verse 2: YG]
I'm sorry momma, I know I ain't shit
I know I lied a lot, I know I ain't slick
Your last dollars...
Yeah, that was me who stole 'em out your purse
(What?) yeah, I know it hurts
I remember days we used to go to church
I used to fall asleep, that shit used to work your nerves
I remember when you had surgery
In a wheelchair hooked to IVâs that hurt me
You're like Superwoman in my eyes
You do a lot to be blind out of one eye
But you ain't let that hold you back
You wheeled on your marathon and run your laps
I broke into houses and sold stolen things for you
I know that ain't the type of things your son should do
You gave birth to me, I love you and thank you
Just know you're well-appreciated

[Hook]


[Verse 1:]
All my life,
Ones say they love you, wanna make you cry
Say never leave you, o-oh how they fly
Gave up my loyalty and paid the price
Got me asking why these people wrong you, but you done them right
They giving up and all you do is fight
You sacrificing, you would even die
And I thank God for never leaving me alone even when I'm on my own
Won't break, I'm standing strong
And I thank God for showing the road to go
When I'm weak and feeling low, built tough, but never show

[Verse 2:]
Sorry, Ms.Jackson, I hate to call in this fashion
I understand it's late and you work harder than average
Plus I'm knowing that you and your son have been clashing
But Keenon called and told me to tell you what happened
He hit a lick with his homies, his homies switched it on him
They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Keenon went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence
The neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
They say the bail like 50 thou
But it's gon' be like 5 thousand to get him out
Man, I told him not to fuck with them niggas
I'm sorry, I don't mean to curse, but I just never trust 'em at all
And he up in the pound, my dawg
And his girl ain't accepting his call
Can't let him fight the charge in his cell, he didn't bail on me
I got 2, we just need the other 3, fight the case on his feet


[Hook: YG]
When I was gone
I heard you was fuckin' on whoever
Love you again? I can never
When I was gone
You tried to take a advantage of a nigga
Had me pull a hammer on a nigga. (on a nigga)
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes
Thass' why you don't love these hoes

[Verse 1: YG]
I was....in jail wit' all niggas
You was waiting to exhale fucking wit all niggas
My momma said I should accept yo apology
But fuck that, that's just reverse psychology
I dont love you no more, and I think you a ho
You let a nigga go too long, without no sto
For all my niggas doing time, I know how it get
Yo homies disappear, and yo bitch turn into a flip

[Verse 2: RJ]
Once upon a time, I thought I found love but then she played me...
I was gone..came back now my baby, having a baby...
I know you was cheatin', I was outta town eatin'
But real players we don't get mad, we get EVEN
But this is why I lost feelins', cause if these hoes ain't fully flippin, then they cartwheeling

[Hook:YG]

[Verse 3: Tee Cee]
She got a nigga in here, dumb hot (dumb hot)
Tell a bitch, hurry up its in that green dot
Left a nigga in the dirt, now she like 7-Eleven giving free slurps
I bought a celly from my cellmate, she dont even text a nigga no kind of sex-play
Fuck that bitch, imma have the lil home girls rush that bitch

[Verse 4: Charlie Hood]
I say my bail too high, my hopes too low
My case too slow, Violation from my P.O
I just got out I shoulda just stayed on the couch, 3-way now my ho tryna cuss me out
And my lawyer say the witness coming to trial, on top of that I heard my main bitch fuckin' around
Im bangin' and shit, my lady prolly sellin' her clit, no money on my books
A nigga taking L'S wit this bitch!

[Hook: YG]

[Verse 5: Reem Riches]
If I put my trust in a bitch, I'll always be hurt
Shoulda known you wasn't shit from that fake louie purse
You broke, dumb and goofy
Really tried to boof me, you gone end up like ya mama a old ratchet hoochie
You couldn't stay down if you was nailed to the floor, three baby daddy's I ain't tryna be fo' (uh-uh)
Thass why I got no love these hoes, sucka duckin', you be suckin all the bros...

[Verse 6: Slim 400]
When I was gone, I heard you was fuckin on budda, hoein in the hood gettin gudda
When I was gone, heard you was hangin on the block...BITCH I dont like you on da block
When I ain't home, you be doing hella ho shit
Thinkin I ain't heard up in this bitch?
Run my door, or imma pull a blade on you BITCH
Pen it til she blast on you BITCH
And I ain't wrong...
My telly went big on the sto and you ain't even yo phone
And now a nigga on, lost all respect for you bitch
You can burn, I ain't gonna spit on you bitch

[Outro: YG]
When I was gone...


[Verse 1 - YG:]
I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm that nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas spear run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
You that nigga on the low-low
You're the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Porsche sittin' on four G's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 9-11
I'm the nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

[Hook - YG:]
Bitch, who do you love? (4 hunna)
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

[Verse 2 - Drake:]
I got a shorty name Texas Syn
She got a buddy name Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'm a crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big
Wassup

[Hook - YG]

[Bridge - YG:]
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Fat heat; run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block

[Hook - YG]

[Outro:]
Nigga we street and we hood
Ain't nobody ever gave us shit
When you see us shinin' it's because we steady grindin'
We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live!
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them asscheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum
Bitch, you know the game!
Ain't a motherfuckin' thing change!
Bitch! Who do you love!?


[Verse 1: D. Lo]

Look,

And if you ain't heard this where the murder at
All eyes on me I think I'm 2 Pac
2 K's but I'm totin me a 40 gloc
Errything purple I mean errything
From the drank in my cup to the Mary Jane

Or get your head cracked like a bad back
It's D.Lo on my mama ain't no nigga harder
My niggas catch murders fuck a manslaughter
I'm Derrick Rose I won't miss a shot
I'm at the free throw line with this 40 gloc
Rondo I keep a 9 on me
Just cause a pussy nigga try to fly on me
You ride for that bitch but you won't ride for your niggas
Youz a B I T C H nigga

[Hook: YG]
Okay nigga stay in your lane

[Verse 2: YG]
Okay nigga stay in your lane

And you ain't got shit
You should be ashamed cause I'm poppin

That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know, then I won't be for real

There ain't no other for me, it's only you

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
She said "your secrets is safe with me"
Just think of her, them pages in my diary
Say don't you ever lie to me, don't ever give that pussy up
Even if I cheated with a bitch that wasn't good enough
'Cause most of the time these bitches don't matter
She say long as she don't find out, just make sure I wrap up
She know a nigga gon' be a nigga
But I'm that nigga she wanna be with
So she might as well put up with it, like "hold up!"

[Outro:]

[Intro:]
Ooh, yeah...

[Bridge:]
And if you with it like I'm with it we can get it crackin'

You know we both Christian, you know we both sinnin'
Just ask for forgiveness at the R-rated movie dinner

[Verse 1:]
With your fine ass, treat you like a wine glass
Top shelf you and beat that pussy up
Beat it up but do it careful
Turn you phone off, girl, no one can help you

Do it in your mama's house, like I don't care if she lookin'
Yeah, it's so good... I have her shakin'
He lookin' - tell him she took it
Put it in my mouth, girl, put it in my mouth
Have you sin, oh my God, girl, just put it in my mouth

And you know I'm with the bros... so bring your home girls
We only fuckin' - it ain't wrong, girl
I'm tryna turn the phone conversation
Into taking off your thong, girl
So if you with that let's skip the chit chat

But I wanna fuck with you so I'm a deal with 'em

Legs up in the back seat, booty in the back seat
The way a nigga ballin' you would think I was an athlete
Mustard in that Benzo, I'm up in that Porsche, though
Youse a bad bitch, why you actin' like a whore, though?
Lean by the quart load - 16 OZs
Mind on a million, bitch, fuck you call me?
All my homies bangers, pistols ain't no strangers
Pistols ain't no strangers, and pistols can't taint us
Ratchets in the lobby, that's my type of party
We buy or sell gangsters, my clique don't need nobody
Rich niggas eat out, pussy niggas Mia
Fuck it then I beast now, like peace out

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm riding in that Porsche, mind on some money

Pussy don't do shit for me, it's just a nut
No homo, I can do that with my hand, bitch, what?
Bitch I think I'm Tupac, bitch I think I'm Tupac
Niggas talk that shit 'til they get their ass popped
Mamas wanna fuck me, their daughters wanna fuck me

All these hoes, Santa Clause couldn't sleigh 'em
All these niggas needin' all this favors
I cut 'em all off, I'm needin' all these razors
Jordan's over gators, khakis over slacks
Money over bitches, but nothin' over that
Money in this music, sad she want influence
The judge want me guilty but the DA can't prove it
I be in the hood with the heat, gangbangin'
Them boys across the street be in the house, they never hangin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Brand new watch, bottom cars brang 'em through the block
Started at the bottom now I made it to the top
Smokin' the best, designer frames, smoke in my chest
Spendin' money like a habit, we ain't supposed to have it
Paid this much just for a tat, that means you supposed to brag
Rick Owens if you lookin' at my tag
I'm tryin' to get drunk and then call a cab
Go to one of my homeboy's spots
So I can show him the bong I just bought
When it comes to bomb weed, I got a lot
My fam' straight as bitch ass niggas, I got a watch
And nah, man, this shit ain't rented, it's off the lot
Charm with tons of rocks, car without the top

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
I do it for my neighbors, crack-sellin' drug dealers
Had to confess to my mama I was a thug nigga
Ten racks on me, nigga, like fuck it
I got the strap on me out here tryna function
Like "yep, yep" damn right, I'll take your lady, my nigga
Like mob shit, and act like it's all gravy, my nigga
Bad bitches getting' fucked, their hair all wavy, my nigga
You gettin' played not paid, man that's shady, my nigga
I be doin' the most, I'll pull that K out
I be in the hood where most rapper don't hang out
I be coppin' Rollies, I be coppin' Porsches
You be cuffin' like the cops, and I don't fuck with law enforcers

[Hook]


[Intro:]
Excuse my liquor

[Chorus:]

And get you sprung on this
Get you sprung on this
Annie let me get you sprung on this
Get you sprung on this

[Verse 1: YG]
If I told you that I love you, I'd be lyin' to you
'Cause if I loved you, I'd be on that jet flyin' to you
Hold up - she got a ass like Pinky
Pretty bitch but she act so easy
Bam! Give it to her like bam!
I ain't' from the lou but that pussy's gettin' rammed
I got her screamin', moanin', hittin' it from the back
Had her home girls like "girl he did that"
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem
Bust a nut in 10 minutes that's my fuckin' problem
Ohh, Can you fuck like you twerk? Ohh
If I do that pussy good then you'll squirt

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: TeeFli]
(Annie)
South Central niggas turn you up
Real niggas in the hood twistin' fingers up
You scared, I ain't scared to beat the pussy up
Don't play no games, I tear it up
Pop that pussy for a hood nigga (shit)
'Cause other Annies wishin' that they were you (bitch!)
Girl I'll fuck your body
Right in front of everybody
You're kissin', scratchin', bitin' me
Oh, all on the top of me
Oh, oh...

[Chorus]


[Verse 1:]
YG the rapper don't trick, but YG the rapper got dick
YG in a Porsche getting' bang from a slut
That I cracked on the bus, I don't give a fuck, nigga what?
Mustard on the beat so you know they gettin' plucked
Fucked like I've been watchin' PornHub on dust
Fuck you from the back with your ass up
Pussy gettin' mashed up, smashed up, mashed like potatoes
Shake it out, aye though!
Bitch named Vaughna ass stacked like Legos
I just wanna fuck, fuck all that soft shit
Her nigga got limp, what's that? He got a soft dick
Her nigga can't get in, I be doin' a sit-in
Hit it form the back, smack, smack, 'til it giddy up
Her nigga broke, he ain't gettin' money, nigga broke
If I was you I'd probably fuck me too â bitch!

[Hook:]
Girl I know you want this dick
Girl I know you want this dick
Girl I know you...

Girl I know you want this dick
Give it to you like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
Give it to you like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I should drink the whole fifth
Niggas always eatin' on shrimp
I ain't used to smoke heavy, now I gotta keep a whole zip
Niggas always talkin' that shit
Your money don't be makin' no sense
Pull up to the hood with no tint
Niggas gotta eat, don't slip
Mustard on the beat, so don't trip
My flow just be makin' hoes sick
I fucked her last week, she cum quick
Everything you see you don't get
Every nigga ballin' ain't rich
Every nigga hatin' is a bitch
And every nigga with him ain't shit
It's lookin' like the denim gon' rip
But Dom K the rapper won't quit
And Dom K the rapper don't trick
On girls that can barely suck dick
She like when I watch
And on her birthday, I but my dick in her box

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Sweet daddy got dick, JM is active
Got some head off Twitter, now nigga that's crackin'
I'm a baby mama killer, your bitch she can get it
You text a bitch, she be like "babe, I'm just chillin'"
My daddy was a ratchet, I sleep with the ratchet
Break a bitch back, I don't need no practice
It's broke-bitch Kay, suckin' with the magnum
You ain't a rich bitch in a Magnum - bop
Bop bop bleed 'em, Boscoe, we bleed 'em
Fuck a basketball wife with PT and G an 'em
I'm a hood rat's hood rat â hood rat
If you need it you can get that
Fuck, back on the couch
I took a bitch down in a sec
Your bitch get around in the set
I dicked the bitch down in the set
The bitch got the set on her neck
I fucked the bitch down in the set

[Hook]


[Intro:]
What can we expect from Tupac in '92?

[Outro:]
Static â it's gon' be static, for sure. 'Cause what the rap audience ain't ready for, it's a real person â you know what I wanna say, a real N.I.G.G.A. I'm comin' out a hundred percent real, I ain't compromisin' nothin', anybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'? It's gon' be straight up, like if I was a street person, that's how I'm comin' at the whole world, and I'm bein' real about it, I'm a grow with my music. The music I make now, my next album's gon' be better and more slammin', you know what I'm sayin'? But at the same toke, I'm gonna be even that much more potent next year, and I don't want no garbage â anybody talk about me, anybody dis Digital Underground, they got problems, 'cause we large and we all over the country, anybody dis us they gon' get stomped. That's word is bond 'cause this is money â so anybody try to take away Digital Underground's money as a whole, they got a problem, we gon' suffocate 'em.

She be happy to pay the taxi and take her where that dough at,
She stressing from confession she like keeeisha where that dro at?
She think conversating with people bout her problems is so whack,
And she don't fck with them btcs, she think them btcs is toe back,
She think the devil is a, friend cause they way she been living,
For the right price; she'll give you that sexual healing,
Sexual feeling, sex and joke let's get moe, powder & sniff it,
Yup, now she tripping her mother; don't love her
So her mind in the gutter, and her big brother got 20 years for murder,
She den been through, it all; nothing more could hurt her
But I respect her struggle so this what I told her.

[Hook: x2]
You look good, how you doing what's ya name girl what's poppin?
I respect ya hustle, girl I can't knock it.
She asked the lord why she livin, cause it ain't making no sense.
She out here selling sex, trynna pay the rent.

[Verse 2:]
3 year old daughter, and her daddy's not involved,
She say her, fraud he don't send no money he don't call,
So she gotta go extra' hard extra' hard,
She got 7 niggas, numbers so went she got home,
She text em all.
She like, what btc [?] get hit, nigga get the fck back
When it comes to letting her baby down,
She like fck that.
She live in the ghetto, she always wearing stillettos
She try, to live by the bible, but she get chased by the devil,
She fck, a nigga, suck a nigga for no less than 300.
Thinking bout, her daughter prolly got her sick to her stomach,
And that's, when she fck it; her mind she finna lose it,
Fcking, all these niggas she out here feeling stupid.
All these problems, with no one answer them,
All these situations, with no one to manage them,
Then she was finna, put the glock to her head,
Til she met a real nigga and he said...

[Hook: x2]
You look good, how you doing what's ya name girl what's poppin?
I respect ya hustle, girl I can't knock it.
She asked the lord why she livin, cause it ain't making no sense.
She out here selling sex, trynna pay the rent

Everytime she hear I got a new bitch, She says she miss me.

Off my shit, you my bitch,
Now sit right here, and ride my dick.

Legs in the air that's yo gift from me,
Rick James super freak,
Grab your waist and now let me eat
Pipe game I'm a beast,
You can say that I'm that mvp.
Mp3, same song go on repeat,
Suck your bottom lip and now climb on top of me!
I'm hard as a rock while I beat your butt like a pinata.
Says she love young money so I let her taste my dollar,
We fell asleep, wet dreams,
Her fantasies woke me up and she said..

[Hook - YG:]
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
We looking bad on the news black on black homicide
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
I need them dollars, got these problems with this llama on my mind
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, gotta keep this hope alive
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
Cause if my homies say it's on then you know I'm down to ride

[Verse 1 - YG:]
We make it hard for us with all this black on black crime
In the same state we gotta pay our tax
If we get locked up it's double rate
We get popped then retaliate, and they sell us these guns
In these fucked up schools where they teach us what they told to
Half the shit I learnt in school I ain't never used
These fucked up rules the government trying to control you
That's why we saying fuck the law, we act like we the ones with the juice
It's fucked up around here, soon as you locked up around here
The rest end up stuck up around here
So I'm speaking for my peers cause I still see their tears
I ain't sugarcoating nothing nigga, this is what it is
They supply us with the county to make us feel comfortable
Couple years pass, we in the same spot we was before
We was content on that section 8 shit
At the first of the month we got them groceries for them kids
But nah, they're fucking up our mental
Keeping us slaves so we can't be successful black people
We need to come together, fuck they system
Tired of being a victim, tired of racism
So I'mma spit this ism 'til this shit stop
Cause this that, nigga, we all we got
We need to stop hating on what the next black got
Give him his props to figure out how he ran shop
So our kid's kid's can be good
On a house in the hills, and with a house out in the hood
(Sound good) Cause them folks that be wealthy
They never thinking of tomorrow, they so unhealthy
We killing ourselves, they killing us too
They distract us with entertainment while they get they loot
They never gave us what they owed us, put liquor stores on every corner
Welcome to Lost Skanless, California

[Interlude - Sadboy:]
Haha, buenos dias motherfuckers
I'm Sadboy Loko and I'm here to speak for my people

[Verse 2 - Sadboy:]
We need to come together, look around
They made the border for the browns cause we're not allowed
Gotta get the green card for me and my child
Those assholes payment under the table that don't last a while
Those jobs getting passed around, they dog our people
Why we gotta look for work at Home Depot?
It was us before the natives, why we ain't equal?
But why you give us no perks, fool we need those
"And we're trying to make America Great"
Fuck you esÃ©, somebody bring him to the Treces
And (*static*) just for disrespecting
Black, brown or pale, it don't matter to me
The only color that call shots in this world is green
And at eighteen they want you to sign up for war
That's why most rather bang and hang around at the store
So to you it's just another selling corn
To me, we out here hustling for the mortgage
Fuck you think we crossing the border for?
Why you think in a bedroom there's more than four?
You explored my country but can't accept my people
But who you want to run your business? My people
My flag is green white, red, in the center's an eagle
Brown Pride, fist high, this is for my illegals

[Hook - Sadboy:]
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
A brown cop harassing me, I guess we all look alike
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
This happens daily, all the time, I can never ask why
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, tryna keep this hope alive
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
Cause if my homies say it's on, then you know I'm down to ride

Don't shoot...don't shoot officer, don't shoot, my hands up...my hands up...
Multiple shot are heard


Woke up this morning feelinâ bool and balm
Ainât have to drank no drank a niggas nerves was balm
Was it cause last night I had some bom
She got ratchet in the red dress we had a bomb
Then I pulled up at the lights them niggas banging real hard
Had to tell them little niggas never heard of yall
Tryna make a nigga lose his composure
Had to hit the gas on emâ almost spilled my whole soda
My curve skills on deck they want the recipe
They like how you do it and then keep it movinâ
Cause see me I usually lose it
When nigga act stupid, like he ainât know my record ruthless
Actinâ like he with the business but he ainât worth me downâ detention
Sittinâ in prison waitingâ for my niggas, asking for money from these bitches
When niggas start trippinâ I be wanna start trippingâ
But Iâm just bicken and act like the bigger nigga

Cause
Iâm bool, balm and bollective
Iâm bool, balm and bollective

So I pull up at Pammy House
Pammy stay next to my family house
And tell you something I used to dig out
I stopped digging she start tripping I had to dip out
Smashin' out of the driveway she threw a brick at my window
So I stopped she ran up and Keyed my 6-4
See when a real nigga hit it needy bitches go schizo
This dick is not a rental, should of knew from get go
Get go, get, get get go
Iâm friendly like Casper but I wait until I hit to get ghost
She called her brother on me straight from the ? But I ainât pussy
Real niggas donât get it between dick and pussy
10 minutes later got a call on my cell
From a nigga sound like he was fresh outta jail
âLike Aye little nigga donât put your hands on my sister
Cause I just gotta outta jail
With manslaughter with a butcher
And she ainât no hooker, she ainât no bitch
My momma raised her right, my little sister got sense"
I told him I ainât test her I just stopped givingâ her dick
Then I told him fuck you and hung up like click
Cause

Iâm bool, balm and bollective
Iâm bool, balm and bollective

Iâm bool, balm, and bollective

Gotta call little later bout this and that
All drama, have to hang up like this is wack
I Shouldnât be talkingâ on the phone either cause Iâm strapped
If the police pull me over, my black ass goinâ back
And thats right up they alley, but I ain't a alley cat
Iâm a red nose pitbull matter of fact
Turns on some jeezy thats what street nigga slap
Right on Oleander right on Spruce we in the back
Now my older homie holleringâ at me
Bout some real life shit and how its âsposed to be
So he approaches me, get real close to me
Try to tell me bout some niggas thats close to me
So I listen and I listen and I listen
And I had to put my bid in
Canât keep it real with some niggas that ainât real with me
He said to keep it P you is right
They ainât never bool they better respect your life

Iâm bool, balm and bollective
Iâm bool, balm and bollective
Iâm bool, balm and bollective
Iâm bool, balm, and bollective

Your money chain and rollie 60 seconds is gone
Man I rather text a nigga fuck a feature for songs
Run up on 'em like nigga where the scene at

[Intro:]
I think we got kicked out because we're a group of black people and like, I guess people... what's going on in America, they're afraid we're gonna say something or do something, but we just wanted to watch the rally, and to get kicked out because we're a group of black people is really crazy. It shows you how racist our own school is that we can't even go to our own school conference

[Chorus - YG:]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

[Verse 1 - YG:]
I like white folks, but I don't like you
All the niggas in the hood wanna fight you
Surprised El Chapo ain't tried to snipe you
Surprised the Nation of Islam ain't tried to find you
Have a rally out in L.A., we gon fuck it up
Home of the Rodney King riot, we don't give a fuck
Black students, ejected from your rally, what?
I'm ready to go right now, your racist ass did too much
I'm bout to turn Black Panther
Don't let Donald Trump win, that nigga cancer
He too rich, he ain't got the answers
He can't make decisions for this country, he gon crash us
No, we can't be a slave for him
He got me appreciating Obama way more
Hey Donald, and everyone that follows
You gave us your reason to be President, but we hate yours

[Chorus - YG:]
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
I don't like your ass, nigga
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
I really don't like you, nigga!
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
This for my grandma!
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

[Verse 2 - Nipsey Hu$$le:]
Nigga am I tripping? Let me know
I thought all that Donald Trump bullshit was a joke
Know what they say when rich niggas go broke
Look, Reagan sold coke, Obama sold hope
Donald Trump spent his trust fund money on the vote
I'm from a place where you prolly can't go
Speaking for some people that you prolly ain't know
It's pressure built up and it's prolly gong blow
And if we say go then they're prolly gong go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gong prolly feel broke
You built walls? We gong prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gong prolly get smoked
Fuck nigga, fuck you!

[Interlude - Donald Trump:]
I will build a great, great wall on our southern border
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words

[Verse 3 - YG & Nipsey Hu$$le:]
Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
Want a little, need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next to kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged
When me and Nip link, that's Bloods and Crips
Where your L.A. rally? We gon crash your shit

[Chorus]


Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot
Nigga Gimmie got shot, hold up
Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot
Nigga Gimmie got shot, uh

Gimmie wanted a lot
Gimmie wanted some money, Gimmie wanted a Glock
Gimmie wanted a spot at the top but he ain't work for it
Gimmie'll drown in that water without a surfboard
And I'm tired of that gimme shit
Cause my whole life ain't nobody gimme shit
Gimmie getting evicted on the first
And who did Gimme call? Nigga I was the first
Gimmie got handed everything he wanted when he wanted it
If he lost it, he wouldn't know how to recover it
Gimmie gon' fuck around and be a nigga who's homie made it
Out the streets but he was on bullshit so he ain't come with him
Niggas be like "Give me a hand out"
YG be like "Why your grown ass hand out?"
"Uhhh, fucked up my money, uhhh, shit got ugly ma
My baby mama was on me" Damn man, we real homies?

Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot

Soft early, get Gimmie what Gimmie was asking for
Couple months later, Gimmie start asking for more
Gimmie said he going through it, life hitting, he be starting to lose it
But every time I give him cash, he buys dro, he a doofus
So I say no and Gimmie took it how he took it
I said no for a reason, but he ain't asked, he said said "Fuck me"
And guess what I found out? Nigga what you find out?
Gimmie and my ex bitch was fucking
Ooh, ah, it touched me
Fuck do I press him? Do I pop him? I need advice Father
"Uhh, I thought you ain't love me no more my nigga
I didn't know what to do, I had to fuck one of your bitches"
See Gimmie all along was a cold nigga
Didn't give him what he wanted so Gimmie stole from niggas
And that's when I pulled out my Glock
Now everybody know how Gimmie got shot

Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot
Niggas be like "Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot"
Nigga Gimmie got shot

My whole life ain't nobody gimme shit


Soon as I thought I was having a good time
This nigga think he slick

I ain't gon' beat around the bush
Let a nigga borrow a couple hundred dollars
My nigga
You the homie I know you got it


I got a question...

When the police gon' stop pressing me?
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?

To a broke boy I never listen, fuck your permission
And 4Hunnid niggas in the building now
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh, oh, oh Lord
Bitch we go hard, go hard, go hard
To all my niggas above the law
Cause we don't really fuck with 'em

You know they like to blast on blacks
And act like they badge was given from God
That's why I gotta stay with my heat

I got a question
When the police gon' stop pressing me?
When my bitch gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?
Will the truth really set you free?

When them boys gon' stop pressing me?
When my girls gon' stop stressing me, second guessing me?

I got a question

Like, when my bitch gon' stop pressing me?
Okay i didn't mean to fuck her, I just had to get my nut off
She was trucking, I was drunk
(She was a bad motherfucker)
That shouldn't even count though
Cause I told you I caught that body, that's trust
You shouldn't count those
See me on my bumper 'bout me, barely checking in
I be on my business making sure them checks is in
She thinks things is changing, she notice we barely fucking
I come and go, when I, when I want, I'm steady hustling
Get the dough, young nigga get the dough
Young nigga, young nigga get the dough
Uh, she tell me "Work with me"
I tell her "Bitch I work the night shift"
She tell me "Don't fight the feeling", "Bitch I'd rather fight"
She like, "this ain't love, how you do me is fucked up
Even when I'm fucked up"

So you better leave your house with a burner

My whoadie got hit up then my whoadie got hit up

But if they catch you with the strap and you black, itâs a wrap
Two years with half, thatâs what the judge give em
Iâm psyched out cause Iâm already striped out
But if I get caught without one (then my lights out)
Iâm psyched out cuz Iâm already striped out

Niggas running in your crib your honor
Tell me what the fuck you would have did your honor

AK grenades,shotgun and a mac too
You would have told your kids to hide
At the front door squeezing on that trigger with pride

Nigga we donât give a fuck, we donât give a fuck

Gotta watch how I walk and wear my outfit
White tan brown black, white tan brown black
We only a couple shades darker how we outfit
Black males in a hoodie thatâs a target to them
They say he oversized and choked him out that was harmless to them
Theyâll hit us and try to blame it like I ainât owe this to them
But fuck it, Iâm waking my people making it harder for them
See, the illuminati hide shit they donât tell us
Well itâs the nigga money cuz my niggas Iâm gon tell them
The truth motherfucker, hear the truth motherfucker
Iâve really got a story, this ainât a spoof motherfucker
Weâll put our hands up and theyâll still shoot motherfucker
And post on trial for one to two motherfucker
They give us years for guns and we can buy em off the shelf
But youâll get life in the coffin if you donât protect yourself

We donât give a fuck, we donât give a fuck
We donât give a fuck, we donât give a fuck

And the list goes on
And they wonder why I live life looking over my shoulder


[YG's Father:]
Daequan!

Ms. "I Can't Leave Los Angeles California"


[Hook - All:]
She wish she was a nigga

[Verse 1 - YG:]
Baby look in the mirror
You got your hair and your nails done
You fucking who you want, not thinking you was wrong
Bitch you wish you was a nigga
Damn you should be ashamed
Acting like those pussy lips can't hang
You been going against the grain
Your body is a temple, you going against the saint
Acting like you was innocent
But as soon as you get mad at your nigga you be with the shits
He just left the house and you calling quick
Who she calling? Some different dick
And you know that ain't lady like
Word around the town that pussy whack but head game nice
If that pussy ain't tight you ain't living right
I'm tryna give her some advice on life but...

[Hook - All:]
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga

She wish she was a nigga

[Verse 2 - Jose Moses:]
Bitches gon' be acting like Bruce but they wanna be Cait
And I heard she fucked Drizzy, didn't even get paid
Damn, lowkey hoeing for a shoutout
She scheming on Wayne before he got out, groupie
You dropped outta school to be a stripper, be a stripper
This lil bitch be acting like a nigga, what
Last nigga said he was straight
Said every time he pulled up, she be pouring the eighth
Everytime he wanna chill, you got some friends over
To every nigga wanna fuck, you just bend over
Instagram selling clothes like a swapmeet
Can't go to no local malls you on the hot seat
Downtown going HAM with your tax check
You off every single drug, you a crack head
Mama told you to value your coochie
But traded that head for a hooptie, bitch

[Hook - All:]
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
She wish she was a nigga
(Nasty ass hoes, let me tell you about this bitch..)
She wish she was a nigga

[Verse - Jay 305:]
Why you always single? Why you think you so cute?
Why girls be calling hoes when they fuck a lot of dude?
Well shit, the answer is this
Y'all bleed once a month and all we got is a dick
Yo emoji was a flip, you know you a hoe bitch
Drinking on some Lemonade thinking she Beyonce, damn
Cheating on her fiance, damn
She getting with it off the powder at the Bombay
Always talking she ain't a hoe, she a hoe
Dropping her kids at granny house, she a hoe
On Snapchat, dog face, she a hoe
LA niggas ain't saving no hoes
The homegirl, the local hoodrat know all the niggas
Be bicken back with the Bloods but she be crippin'
Got drunk one night, tryna fight, this bitch be trippin'
If you was a nigga, you'd be a bitch nigga

[Hook:]
She wish she was a nigga
(Bitch what you gotta say about this hoes)
She wish she was a nigga
(Boop ass bitches, man, stripping)
She wish she was a nigga

She wish she was a nigga
(Taking pictures in front of Maestro's, bitch, man that shit is played out hoe)
She wish she was a nigga

[Joe Moses + Jay 305:]
Man these hoes man, I don't know man, they lost
They need God man, they need God and Jesus they need to be baptized, I don't know...
A nigga like me, Jay 305, man to pimp one of these bitches, put one of these bitches on the trinnack
Man you know what man, I digs that, I digs that

Look at my life
Been through it all, got bullet wounds twice
Still don't know where it came from, yikes
Why everybody want a piece of my pie?
I, I, gotta keep guns with me
Shit real, I ain't tryna be pretty
Paranoia got this Henny in my kidney
Cause I don't know if they're with me or against me
They always said this was how it's gon' be
But me... I ain't wanna believe
They don't wanna see a nigga with the green
The reason for the 40 cal with the beam
The devil's on me, got me trippin'
I used to party out with Scotty like Pippen
Now I don't trust niggas, and I stopped invitin' bitches
Over to the crib, they can't know where I'm livin'

Shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh shit, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy

Verse two, verse two
I got too much to spit for verse two
Just be careful on how you approach dude
Cause he done already heard about what you wanna do
Paranoia, paranoia
Paranoia down in killer California
What's their motive? What's their motive?
Shit, I'm the closest with some money that they know of
Lady problems, family problems
Homies problems, all this drama
On my mama, this the type of shit you sweat out in the suana
Grandma pray for me, devil keep away from me
Fell out with my day one, that was my ace to me
Mind blown, somethin' different when I'm on
All this shit got me in another rhyme zone
Lately, I've been at home
I grab the pistol when I answer the door

Cause this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh shit, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy

I ain't F with this, but I F with this
Can't complain about it, gotta find out where he gonna master it
Gotta put cameras all around the crib
Gotta, gotta wear the vest like a bib
Got some, got some problems, a whole lot 'em
So I stay dangerous, Osama
Nigga say they heard about a million dollars
So I gotta bulletproof the Impala
Man I'm 'bout to lose it
Homies I'm confused with
Money get involved, it's all bad, they switch too quick
It's too sick, thought you was realer, my nigga
Got popped, you ain't do shit
Thought you was my killer, my nigga
Oh! Shit get realer, my nigga
When niggas know you gettin' skrilla, my nigga
I don't know what's gotten into my nigga
Close from day one, I was with him, my nigga

This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
This shit, nigga, this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh this shit, this shit
This shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh Lord, nigga this shit brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy, brazy
Oh shit, this shit, this shit
This shit brazy


You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands

Why all these rap niggas wanna be bloods?
Never see them in the hood only see them in the club
As Snaz snuck in with the snub, and I just left the block
Had the homies say I'm dumb
What's up with that, shit
Nigga I don't fuck with that, shit
I'm 'bout to pull a Suge Knight and press the issue on sight
The real bloods either check or we own your ass
I'm with the sleeve flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low cutting with my socks, like a cholo
I coulda got a ghost but I went and got a low low
This copying off you rap niggas is a no no
I can hop out solo, tucked is a 4-4
I probably need three more, cause these niggas is emo
And see my altitude, I have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?

You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingaz with my hands

Hold up, I really got something to say
I'm the only one who made it out the west without Dre

Who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
I don't know, who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?

I'm like, "Damn, did the homies set me up?"
Cause we ain't really been talking much
I know that sounds sick, my thoughts dark as fuck
Like the barrel of the pistol I saw when he sparked it up
Prolly was mad as fuck when I walked out the hospital
Stupid ass motherfuckers, thinking they was going to stop Gizzle
Had my pops mad, my momma sad, my sister feel bad
My lil bro still mad, domebody got to pay for that
My granny's prayers work cause it could've got worse
I'm talking pictures on the shirt
When the shots went off, I thought the spot was deserted
But nah everybody in the spot was just nervous
I don't like that, nah I don't like that, we can't go right back
So many niggas ready to go, we can go war with Iraq
They knew the code to my gate, that was awkward
Answer this, I got a million dollars

Who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
I don't know, who shot me?
Who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
I don't know, who shot me?
Who shot me?

Maybe it cause I fucked Jamal bitch and I knew if he found out
Her scary ass was gon tell him about my hideout
Yeah they really came to the front door
But luckily we had something fatter than this 9 out
Or maybe it was the nigga that I socked out
When he hit me first I shoulda been knocked out
All these maybe maybe maybe maybeâs
Iâm about to say fuck it and start squeezing without aiming
I got trust issues if I donât fuck with dude
My body language gon tell him I donât fuck with you
I canât sleep at night this shit unbomftable
Having nightmares of me coming for dude
Having a hard time putting together two and two
They was in a brand new truck, somebody sent them dudes
They knew the code to my gate that was awkward
Answer this, I got a million dollars

Who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
I don't know, who shot me?
Who shot me
Motherfucker who shot me?
Motherfucker who shot me?
I don't know, who shot me?
Who shot me?

Staring out the window
Smoking on this indo
Cause I donât know who did it but I know this
Bullets donât just go where the wind blows
So I'm looking under my nose
And it always comes from up close
But they canât stand me though

Niggas ainât do no damage though
Nigga bounced up that muthafuckin' hospital
That same night, walked that shit off
Like a motherfucker gangsta is posed to, nigga, feel me
Like my mama asked this nigga
Like âBoy whatâs wrong with youâ
Motherfucker shot me, nah mama
None of these motherfuckers can stop me, nah mama
Just got to walk it off mama
Who shot me?
After all the wicked shit I did
I knew karma was gon catch up with a nigga
(Hey nigga what you doing?)
Damn, I ainât know it was gon' happen like this
(Nigga watch out, nigga you ainât coming in here)
Some nigga really tried to set me up
I know shit get wicked in the street sometimes
Like I said âYou never know when it might brack offâ
But I guess God has some other plans for me
Cause that shit ain't stop me


[Verse 1 - YG:]

Give me space, we might rob the shit
Most hate it, baby they don't love the clique

This some other shit, yeah
Yeah, yeah, this some other shit
Friends and business don't mix so I'm brotherless
Tryna get back close, hit 'em with the stiff
Gears I shift, make sure they feel the drift
Just copped the Benzo with the tint
You should know cause in every song I said this shit
Yeah, in every song I said this shit
I'm just proud of my accomplishments
I'm a 4Hunnid nigga, I don't care at all

[Verse 3 - YG:]
If you ain't know me, bet you know now
Drizzy came through with the verse for me both times
Bomp-town that's an automatic hold down
What's that? Ask no questions, just hold it down
Why you hatin' on the progress?
I'm a humble nigga, I don't even pop shit
What I do?
I just drive the Maybach through the projects
And Still Brazy ain't even drop yet
Hate from a distance, please don't try me
Cause we'll turn it up on anybody

Baby why you leave me alone?
I thought we was in love, until you lett me go.
Put me on a boat & send me to the coast,
I miss them nights when I used to pipe & deep stroke
And I even used to fucking ball like a free throw; every Friday our bedroom was like a freakshow.
Thought I was yo nigga for life; yo hero? That's the words that she spoke, but that's fucked up the homies told me don't trip, but how I'm not gon trip when I lost my bitch?
Feeling like r Kelly I wish I wish.
And naw I ain't gon cry but I miss my bitch.
I miss my bbygirl but I don't know her anymore.
You gon do me like this? I guess this a cold world, it's a dog eat dog world & the dogs chase the cats.
Fucked up that she ain't coming back (naw)

Baby why you leave me? (leave me alone)
Baby why we don't talk no mo?

Be yo nigga fo'sho (I used to be, but I'm not no mo)
Baby why you do me wrong?
(Baby why you leave me) [x3]
Baby why you do me wrong?

Baby why you leave me? (why)
You did it so easy (fucked up)
I tried to tell my momma (hahaha)
But my momma didn't believe me (damn)
This shit is off the hezzy, a nigga miss his brezzy
I miss the freaky things she used to do just to please me
Petty Pablo I had a freak a lic
She up & left the young faster than the GT
Just wish I could make things rewind, cause I'll rewind when she left me like the springtime.
I'll be fine? everybody know that that's a lie
Rockabye baby, rockabye baby
I think I need to go to rehab, I'm going crazy
I did everything you wanted me to & you played me!
And you know what's some fucked up shit?
I ain't even with another chick (damn)

Baby why you leave me? (leave me alone)
Baby why we don't talk no mo?
I used to be on easy!
Be yo nigga fo'sho (I used to be, but I'm not no mo)
Baby why you do me wrong?
(Baby why you leave me) [x3]
Baby why you do me wrong?

Since the day you left, I can't rest
I been out the house by myself, depressed
Riding round the streets by myself, tryna find somebody cause I really need help
So baby come back, baby comeeee back
Baby come back, baby comeeee back
Tell me what's the issue, girl I really miss you
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna kiss you

Baby why you leave me? (leave me alone)
Baby why we don't talk no mo?
I used to be on easy!
Be yo nigga fo'sho (I used to be, but I'm not no mo)
Baby why you do me wrong?

[Intro - YG:]
Damn Bitch
Fuck off, always on my head bout some bullshit
So what man, you nothing to me

[Verse - YG:]
Yeah thatâs my other bitch, she be trippin when I say im with another bitch
Sold her a dream that wont come true but she hope it is
We blowin blunts like candles, when you make a wish
Going back and forth, arguing about whos mistake it is
You know I aint the type of nigga for relationships
All these problems like a vacation, im getting away from them
Like save the problems for your mama, I aint buying em
Like girl you the only one im wit, she know im lying
Talking bout bitches I fucked the first night I met em 
Like if you aint gon do nothing about it, bitch shut up
She tired of my shit, she cant do it, she fed up
And if she lookin for tha dough, Iâd be glad to help herâ
And she know about my other bitch 
If I aint fucking her, she know who im fucking wit
And im caught up in the mix
Cuz im in love with this girl but I love the other bitch

[Chorus x2 - TY$:]
I think she knows about, my other bitch
Sheâs always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police

[Verse - YG:]
And my girlfriend came home, warning
She be searching through my shit like she had a warrant
Tryna find out who my who other bitch, 
Lying to her saying she a good friend, yeah right bitch
And if you ridin wit me, nigga hop in
My other bitch got me feeling like im flyer than a rocket
All that bullshit you talking bout you need to stop it
And not appeal but im tryna pop, lock and drop it
And we can keep it low nobody gotta know
But sometimes having two bitches the way to go
And if I cant trust some of the homies, I cant trust a hoe
Cuz all she wanna do is argue, I said fashoo
And she searching through my shit like she the police
I know weâve been talking for a minute but you donât know me
And I think she know about my other bitch
But she cant do nothing about it but just live with it

[Chorus x2 - TY$:]
I think she knows about, my other bitch
Sheâs always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police

[Verse - YG:]
Im telling her how it is, she say stop playing stupid
Im in the streets, on the grind tryna do me 
She asking me questions, where you at? who are you with?
Jumping to conclusions that im fucking with a new bitch
So, I bought her flowers on the weekend
Hope she forgives me for cheatin
But if she donât imma be cool, cuz imma go back to girlfriend number two

[Chorus x2 - TY$:]
I think she knows about, my other bitch
Sheâs always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police
