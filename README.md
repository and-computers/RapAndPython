Teaching the basics of python and programming using text analysis of lyrics

## Curriculum:
#### *Note that this order is still being worked on. I really just want to go through the whole process in order, which is why the http, api interactions, and webscraping are in sequence (collecting the data before working with it). There's also the possibility of giving people the option to start with a dataset thats already been setup.

1. Installing python and packages (Anaconda 2)

2. Git & Github

3. HTTP requests and interacting with APIs

4. Webscraping

5. Python's data structures (dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets)

6. Common and useful string methods.

7. Regular Expression (Regex)

7. ML Type Things (?)
